A. D. 16.] 83 OF TACITUS.


4» their men may, at first shfht, be hideous; in the" onset they may have bodily vigour: but let them44 feel the anguish of their wounds, and they betakel4 themselves to flight, impatient of pain, void of ho-" nour, and regardless of their officers; cowards in ad-" versity, and, in the hour of success, above all laws," both human and divine. Do you wish, my fellow-" soldiers, for an end of all your toils? Are you weary" of tedious voyages, and laborious marches? Now is"your opportunity: one battle ends the war. The" Elbe is nearer than the Rhine. Beyond this spot" we have nothing to subdue. It was here that Dru-" bus, my father, triumphed; and here, Tiberius, myM uncle, reaped his laurels. Exert one vigorous effort," and you make me their rival, perhaps their equal in" glory." This speech was received with acclama­tions ; and the ardour of the men blazing out at once,the signal for the charge was given.
XV. Arminius and the German chiefs omittednothing that could rouse the courage of their men."Behold," they said, "the refuse of the Varian ar-"my; a set of dastards in the field, and rebels in" their camp. With their backs seamed with stripes," their limbs enervated, their strength exhausted by" tempestuous voyages, dispirited, weak, and void of* hope, they are given to our swords, a sacrifice to" the gods, and the victims of German valour. To" avoid a fiercer enemy they fled to the ocean, where" we could neither attack, nor hang upon their rear."In the ensuing battle the winds cannot befriend" them ; their oars can give them no assistance. Call"to mind their pride,their avarice, and their cruelty;" above all, let us remember to act like men, who"have resolved to live in freedom, or to die with" glory."
XVI. By these and such like incentives the Ger­mans were inflamed with uncommon ardour. Thechiefs conducted them, burning with impatience, toan open plain, called the Idistavisian vale, situatebetween the Visurgis and a chain of mountains. Theground was of an irregular form, narrow in someparts, where the hills projected forward, and in

order supplications for the recovery ofLivia, with so­lemn games on the occasion; in which the pontiffs,the augurs, the college of fifteen, with' that of theseptemvirs, and the sodality of Augustan priests wereto conduct the ceremonies. Lucius Apronius movedthat the heralds at arms should likewise officiate.Tiberius'opposed the motion. It proceeded, he said,on a mistaken principle. He. mentioned the distinctfunctions of the several orders of the priesthood, andmade it clear, from ancient precedents, that the he­rald had never been admitted to that participation ofhonour. The fraternity of Augustan priests was call­ed forth with good reason, since that order belonged,in a peculiar manner, to the family for which publicvows were to be offered.
LXV. To give in detail, the several motions andresolutions of the time, is not within the plan of thiswork. And yet, when virtue and fair integrity dohonour to the heart, or when a slavish spirit brandsthe character, in either case, it is my intention to se­lect the particular instances. In this I apprehendconsists the chief part of the historian's duty. It ishis to rejudge the conduct of men, that generous ac­tions may be snatched from oblivion, and that theauthor of pernicious counsels, and the perpetrator ofevil deeds, may see beforehand, the infamy thatawaits them at the tribunal of posterity. In general,a black and shameful period lies before me. The agewas sunk to the lowest depth of sordid adulation; in­somuch that not only the most illustrious citizens, inorder to secure their pre-eminence, were obliged tocrouch and bend the knee, but men of consular andprsetorian rank, and the whole body of the senate,tried with emulation which should be the most obse­quious slave. We are informed by tradition, thatTiberius, as ofi^en as he went from the senate-house,was used to say in Greek, " Devoted men! how they" rush headlong into bondage!" Even he, the enemy ofcivil liberty, was disgusted with adulation, he playedthe tyrant, and despised the voluntary slave.

mass, without an effort to rise. Sacrovir threw him­self into the town of Augustodunum, but in a shorttime, fearing to be given up a prisoner, withdrew,with his most faithful adherents, to , a villa in theneighbourhood, where he put an end to his life. Hisfollowers, having first set fire to the place, turnedtheir swords against themselves, and perished in onegeneral carnage.
XLVII. Tiberius, at length, thought fit to write tothe senate on the subject of these commotions. Inone and the same letter he gave an account of thewar begun and ended. He neither magnified nordisguised the truth, but in plain terms ascribed thewhole success to the valour of his officers, and thewisdom of his councils. Why he did not go in per­son, or send his son Drusus, the same letter explainedhis reason: " The extent and majesty of the empire" claimed his utmost care. It was not for the dignity" of the prince, on the revolt of one or two cities, to" relinquish the seat of government. But now, since" he could not be supposed to be under any kind qf" alarm, it was his intention to show himself to the"provinces, in order, by his presence, to allay the" ferment, and restore the public tranquillity." Vowsfor his return, and solemn festivals, with other usualceremonies, were decreed by the senate. Dolabella,intending to display his genius in the trade of flattery,succeeded so far as to show his meanness and absur­dity. He proposed that the emperor, on his returnfrom Campania, should enter the city with the splen­dour of an ovation. This occasioned a letter to thesenate from Tiberius, wherein he observed, " that af-" ter conquering fierce and warlike nations, and hav-"ing in his youth received and declined triumphal" honours, he was not such a novice to glory as to" desire, in the evening of his days, the vain parade" of a public entry, for an excursion that was little"more than a party of.pleasure to the suburbs ot" Rome."

bravest of the Germans, who dared to face everydanger, died under repeated wounds. The enemywas dislodged from the rampart. Germanicus, atthe head of the prsetorian cohorts, advanced into thowoods: the battle there was fierce and obstinate:both sides fought hand to hand. Behind the barba­rians lay the morass; in the rear of the Romans theriver and the woods; no room to retreat; valour theironly hope, and victory their only safety.
XXI. The martial spirit of the Germans yieldedin nothing to the Romans; but their weapons, andtheir manner of fighting, were a great disadvantage.Pent up in a forest too close for such a multitude,they could neither wound at a distance, nor managetheir weapons with their usual agility. The Romans,on the contrary, with their bucklers close to thebreast, and their hands covered with the hilt of theirswords, found the large proportions of the enemy aneasy mark. They gashed the barbarians in the face,and drove them from their ranks. Arminius no longerfought with his usual ardour. Ill success, so oftenrepeated, depressed his spirit; or perhaps the wound,which he had received in the late engagement, hadexhausted his strength. Inguiomer, performing won­ders, and busy in every part of the field, was aban­doned by his fortune, not by his courage. Germani­cus threw off his helmet, that his person might bobetter distinguished; and rushing among the ranks,exhorted his men to give no quarter. He cried aloud," We have no need of prisoners: extirpate the barba­dians; nothing less will end the war." Tho daybeing far advanced, he ordered one of the legions toquit the field, in order to prepare an encampment: therest had their measure of revenge, till the approachof night put an end to the effusion of blood. In thisbattle the Roman cavalry fought with undecidedsuccess.
XXII. Germanicus in a public harangue commend­ed the valour of his army; and afterwards raised apile of arms as a trophy of victory, with this splendidinscription: "The army of Tiberius Cesar, having

" come hither in crowds to solicit for their children;" the public funds may be exhausted, and the craving" of individuals will remain unsatisfied. To depart" from the question before the senate, and open new" matter for the public service, was no doubt the" practice of our ancestors; but, under that sanction," to introduce domestic concerns, with a view to pri-"vate interest, is an abuse of the privilege, tending" directly to reduce the senate, as well as the sove-
* reign, to a painful dilemma. Whether we comply," or refuse our consent, either way we encounter pre­judice. Besides, this mode of petitioning is not aw modest humble request; it is a demand, brought on" by surprise, while other business is before us. At" such a time the petitioner comes, and with the ageM and number of his children assails the passions of this"assembly: he does more; he makes a sudden tran-" sition to ourself, and by violence of prayer hopes" to storm the treasury. But let us remember that, if
* by our profusion we exhaust the public stock, our" crimes must replace it. You are not, Hortalus, now" to learn, that the bounty of Augustus was his own"voluntary act: he gave you money, but never in-Mended that you should live a rent-charge upon the" public. By false compassion we injure the comma-" nity; industry will go to ruin; sloth will predomi­nate, men will no longer depend upon themselves;"but, having from their own conduct nothing to hope" or fear, they will look to their neighbours for sup-"port: they will first abandon their duty, and then" be a burthen on the public."
Such were the reasonings of Tiberius. His speechwas well received by that class of men, who are everready to applaud the vices, no less than the virtues,of their master: others heard in silence, or at mostwith a murmur of disapprobation. Tiberius saw theimpression on the minds of the fathers: he paused,and added, that what he had said was a reply toHortalus; but if the senate judged it proper, he waswilling to give two hundred great sesterces to eachof his sons. The fathers expressed their thinks;Hortalus made no answer, perhaps through fe&r, or

" thought the interests of Germany and Rome were" interwoven with each other; I have been your friend,"because I preferred peace to war. Governed by"these principles, I addressed myself to Varus, who" commanded your armies ; before his tribunal, I ex­hibited an accusation against Arminius, the ravisher" of my daughter, and the violator of public treaties." But sloth and irresolution were the bane of that un-" fortunate general. From laws enfeebled and relaxed" I expected no relief. I therefore desired, earnestly■ desired, that Arminius, and the other chiefs of the" conspiracy, might be thrown into irons. I did not* except myself. With what zeal I pressed the mea-" sure, witness that fatal night, which I wish had been" my last. The horrors that followed, demand our"tears: they cannot be justified. Soon after that"tragic event, I confined Arminius in chains; and"from his faction I have suffered in my turn, the" same indignity. Admitted now to an interview with" Germanicus, I prefer ancient friendship to new con­nexions; my voice is still for peace. For myself, I" have nothing in view: my honour is dear to me,"and I desire to repel all suspicion of perfidy. I" would, if possible, make terms for my countrymen,"if the}'can be induced to prefer a well-timed repen-" tance to calamity and ruin. For my son, and the"errors of his youth, I am a humble suppliant. My" daughter, indeed, appears before you, by necessity,"not by her own choice: I acknowledge it. It is"yours to decide her fate; it is yours to judge which"ought to have most influence, her husband or her"father: she is with child by Arminius, and she sprung" from me." Germanicus, in his usual style of mo­deration, assured him that his children and relationsnhould be protected; as to himself, he might dependupon a safe retreat in one of the old provinces. Hethen marched back to the Rhine; and there, by thedirection of Tiberius, was honoured with the title ofImperator. The wife of Arminius was delivered ofa boy, who was reared and educated at Ravenna.The disasters which made him afterwards the sport,of fortune, shall bo related in their proper place.

that of Athens, by Solon, have been chiefly cele­brated. In the latter, however, we see simplicitygiving way to complication and refinement. At Rome,the reign of Romulus was the reign of despotism.His will was the law. Numa Pompilius introducedthe rites and ceremonies of religion, and by establish­ing forms of worship, strengthened the civil union.Some improvements were added by Tullus Hostilius,and some by Ancus Martius. But the true legislatorwas Servius Tullius: the author of that best policywhich made even kings the subjects of the laws.
XXVII. After the expulsion of TaTquin, the peo­ple, to secure their rights from powerful factions inthe senate, and to prevent the effects of civil discord,,were obliged to modify the constitution by new regu­lations. With this view, the decemvirs were created.Those magistrates, by adopting from the wisdom ofother nations what appeared worthy of selection,framed a body of laws entitled the Twelve Tables.,'All sound legislation ended there. It is true that, af­ter that time, new statutes were enacted; but, if weexcept a few, suggested by the vices of the times, andpassed on the spur of the occasion, they were, for themost part, made in the conflict of parties, and for theworst of purposes; in some instances, to lay open toambition the road to honours; in others, to work thedownfall of illustrious citizens: and, in general, withpernicious motives. Hence the Gracchi, and the Sa-turnini, those turbulent demagogues; and hence theviolent spirit of Drusus, that famous partisan of thesenate, who, by largesses and open bribery, supportedthe claims of the nobility, and by specious promisesinduced the allies of Rome to espouse his cause, de­ceiving them at first, and between the senate and thepopular leaders, making them in the end, the bubbleof contending factions. Hence a wild variety of con­tradictory laws. In the social war, which involvedall Italy, and the civil commotions that followed, newordinances were established, but with the same con­tentious spirit, till at length Lucius Sylla, the dicta­tor, by repealing several laws, by amending others,ini* "y or. ir' '114 a ode of his own, gave a chock

their defeat, to undertake a siege, changed his planof operations. He chose a roving kind of war; ifthe Romans advanced, quick in retreat, and, as soonas the pursuit was over, wheeling round to hang uponthe rear. By this desultory mode of skirmishing, thewily African baffled and fatigued the Roman army,till having ravaged the country near the sea-coast, andloaded his men with booty, he was obliged to pitchhis camp. In that situation Apronius Csesianus, sonof the proconsul, at the head of the cavalry, the auxi­liary cohorts, and a body of light infantry, draughtedfrom the legions, gave battle to the Numidian, and,having gained a complete victory, obliged him to flyto his wilds and deserts. .
XXII. At Rome, in the rr *n time, a prosecutionwas carried on against Lepida, a woman of illustriousbirth, descended from the ^milian family, and greatgrand-daughter both to Sylla and Pompey. She wasmarried to Publius Quirinius, a citizen of great wealth,far advanced in years, but without children to inherithis estate. The wife was charged with an attemptto pass a supposititious child for his legitimate issue.Other articles were added; such as adultery, dealingin poison, and consultations with Chaldean astrolo­gers concerning the fate of the imperial family. Herbrother, Manius Lepidus, undertook her defence.Quirinius had repudiated her; and yet, after his di­vorce, attacked her with implacable resentment.This circumstance, notwithstanding the guilt and in­famy of Lepida, rendered her an object of compassion.In the course of the proceeding, the real sentimentsof Tiberius eluded all discovery. Fluctuating betweenopposite passions, he mixed and shifted mercy and re­sentment in such quick succession, that where hewould fix it was impossible to guess. He desired thatthe crime of violated majesty might bo thrown out ofthe case, and in a short time after, ordered MarcusServilius, of consular rank, and the rest of the wit­nesses, to prove the very facts over which he pre­tended to draw a veil. He removed the slaves ofLepida, who had been placed under a military guard,to the custody of the consuls; nor would he suffer

tan us, proconsul of Asia, was accused of rapine andextortion by the people of the province. The conductof the cause was undertaken by Mamercus Scaurus,of consular rank ; by Junius Otho, at that time pravtor; and Brutidius Niger, one of the sediles. Thecomplaint was aggravated by an additional charge ofirreverence to the divinity of Augustus, and disaffec­tion to Tiberius. Mamercus affected to grace himselfby citing the bright examples of a former day; ScipioAfricanus, he observed, prosecuted Lucius Cotta;Cato, the censor, appeared against Servius Galba,an,d Marcus Scaurus, against Publius Rutilius; as ifthose great and excellent men had instituted prosecu­tions for constructive crimes like the present; as ifScaurus, the grandfather of the prosecutor, had de­scended to so vile an office. It was reserved for Ma­mercus, to degenerate into an informer, and tarnishthe lustre of his ancestors. Junius Otho, another pro­secutor, had been by profession the teaches of a school.Raised from that obscurity by the patronage of Seja-nus, he obtained a seat in the senate, and hoped byflagitious deeds to efface the meanness of his origin.Brutidius was a different character. Adorned withliberal accomplishments, and formed for great things,he was sure of reaching the first honours of the state,had he been willing to walk in the paths of virtue.His impatience ruined him. Eager to outstrip hisequals, and then to rise over his superiors, he enlargedhis views: and began to soar above his most flatteringhopes: but his ambition led him to the precipice fromwhich good men have often fallen, when, not contentwith slow, but sure success, they have hurried on withtoo much ardour, and ended their career in ruin.
LXVII. Gellius Poplicola, who had been qurastorto Silanus, and Marcus Paconius, his lieutenant, listedon the side of the prosecution. Silanus, beyond alldoubt, was guilty both of rapine and oppression ; butin his case a number of circumstances, dangerouseven to innocence, conspired against him. Besidesthe persons already mentioned, the most able oratorsof Asia, men who were chosen on account of theireloquence, united their strength. Against that pow­

others, where the windings of the river made an open­ing, stretching into length. In the rear of the Ger­mans, and at a small distance, rose a thick forest; thetrees large and lofty, with branches expanding nearthe top; but the trunks bare towards the bottom, andthe intermediate space clear of underwood. Of thisplain, and the approaches to the wood, the barbarianstook possession. The Cheruscans, apart from the rest,took post on the hills, to watch the fortune of theday, and in good time to pour down with fury on theRoman army. Germanicus ranged his men in thefollowing order: the Gauls and German auxiliariesformed the front of the line, followed by a body ofarchers on foot, and four legions, with Germanicusat the head of two prsetorian cohorts, and a selectbody of cavalry. Four other legions, with the lightinfantry, the horse-archers, and the remainder of theallies, brought up the rear. The whole army pro­ceeded in order of battle, all instructed to preservetheir ranks, and to receive with firmness the first im­pression of the enemy.
XVII. The Cheruscans, too impatient to keep theirpost, rushed with impetuosity from their hills. Ger­manicus no sooner saw their motions, than he sent achosen body of horse to charge them in flank, whileStertimus, with another detachment, wheeled roundto fall upon the rear. The general himself was ready,if occasion required, to second the attack at the headof the legions. In that moment eight eagles wereseen stretching with rapid wing towards the wood,where they entered, and disappeared. This was re­ceived as an omen of victory. " Advance," said Ger­manicus, "the Roman birds have marshalled»you the" way. Pursue the tutelar deities of the legions." Theinfantry began the assault in front: the cavalry, atthe same time, charged the flank and rear. The bar­barians, thrown into confusion, presented an uncom­mon spectacle: those who had been stationed in thewoods were driven forward to the plain; and fromthe plain, the foremost lines fled for shelter to thewoods. Between both the Cheruscans were drivendown from their heights. Arminius, their chief, per-

sixth legion deserted to him with his standard. Sen-tius resolved to carry the place by assault. The sig­nal for the charge was given; scaling ladders wereadvanced to the walls; the foremost in courage beganto mount to the top of the work; while an incessantvolley of darts, and stones, and flaming brands, waspoured in upon the garrison. Piso desired to capitu­late. He offered to lay down his arms, upon condi­tion that he should remain in the castle till the em­peror's pleasure touching the government of the pro­vince should be finally declared. The propositionwas rejected. Sentius allowed him safe conduct toItaly, and shipping for his passage: no other termswere granted.
LXXXII. The indisposition of Germanicus wasknown at Rome some time before his death. Thenews, like all distant intelligence, increased everymoment, and bad was made worse by exaggeration.Grief and loud complaints filled every quarter of thecity. " Was it for this, that Germanicus was sent to" distant regions ? For this, was the province of Sy-" ria assigned to Piso ? This is the consequence of"private interviews between Livia and Plancina!" When Drusus, the father of Germanicus, died, it" was observed by men of reflection, and observed" with truth, that if the son of a despotic prince is the" friend of civil liberty, his father never forgives his" virtues. It was for this that Drusus and Gormani-" cus were snatched away from the Roman people." They intended to restore the old constitution, and" they perished in the cause." Such were the senti­ments that prevailed at Rome. The fatal news atlength arrived. In that moment the passions of menknew no bounds. Without waiting for an edict ofthe magistrates, or a decree of the senate, a cessationof all business took place; the courts of justice weredeserted ; houses were shut up; shrieks and' groansburst out, and at intervals a deep and awful silencefollowed.
A general mourning covered the face of the city.The exterior forms of grief were observed, but the an­guish of the heart surpassed all outward show. It

them to be examined under the torture upon anypoint that concerned himself or his family. He ex­empted Drusus, though consul elect, from the rule,that required him to give the first vote. This bysome was considered as a true republican principle,that the fathers might give their voices, free and un­influenced by the example of the prince. Otherscalled it a stroke of subtle cruelty, it being by nomeans probable, that Drusus would decline to speakin order of time, if a sentence of condemnation hadnot been already fixed.
XXIII. The celebration of the public games sus­pended the trial for some days. In that interval, Le-pida, accompanied by a train of illustrious women,entered the theatre: in a pathetic strain she invokedher ancestors; she called on Pompey in his own thea­tre (that monument of grandeur,) and addressed her­self to the images of that illustrious man. Her griefmade an impression; tears gushed from the eyes of thepeople, and, indignation soon succeeding, bitter exe­crations were thrown out against Quirinius; " a su-" perannuated dotard, sprung from a mean extraction," to whom in the decline of life, a noble dame, for-" merly intended to bo the wife of Lucius Csesar, and" by consequence, the grand-daughter of Augustus," was joined in wedlock, that he, good man! might" raise heirs to his estate." Notwithstanding theseclamours, the slaves of Lepida were put to the ques­tion. Their evidence amounted to full proof of herguilt; and on the motion of Rubellius Blandus, shewas forbid the use of fire and water. Even Drususgave his assent, though a milder sentence would havebeen agreeable to the wishes of a considerable num­ber. By the interest of Scaurus, her former husband,who had a daughter by her, the confiscation of herproperty was remitted. At the close of the proceed­ings, Tiberius informed the fathers, that he had exa­mined the slaves of Quirinius, and their evidence lefthim no room to doubt of a formed design to poisonher husband.

" of scorn and insolence to the colours and the Roman" eagles."
LXII. Six years had elapsed since the overthrowof Varus; and now, on the same spot, the Romanarmy collected the bones of their slaughtered country­men. Whether they were burying the remains ofstrangers, or of their own friends, no man knew: all,however, considered themselves as performing thelast obsequies to their kindred, and their brother sol­diers. While employed in this pious office, their heartswere torn with contending passions; by turns op­pressed with grief, and burning for revenge. A monu­ment to the memory of the dead was raised with turf.Germanicus with his own hand laid the first sod; dis­charging at once the tribute due to the legions, andsympathizing with the rest of the army. The whole,though an act of piety to the slain, was condemnedby Tiberius. The malignity of his nature led him tomisinterpret the actions of Germanicus; perhaps howas apprehensive, that the view of a field covered'with the unburied limbs of a slaughtered arjny,might damp the ardour of the soldier, and add to theferocity of the enemy. There might be another rea­son for his displeasure. Perhaps he thought that ageneral, invested with the office of augur, and otherreligious functions, ought not to assist at the per­formance of funeral rites.
LXIII. Germanicus pressed forward, by rapidmarches, in pursuit of Arminius, who fled before him.taking advantage of the defiles, and difficult part ofthe country. Having overtaken the barbarians, andseeing his opportunity, be ordered the cavalry to ad­vance on the open plain, and dislodge the enemy.Arminius drew up his men in close compacted ranks,and feigning a retreat to the forest, suddenly wheeledabout; giving, at the same time, the signal to thetroops that lay ambushed in the woods, to rush out,and begin the attack. The Roman cavalry, struckwith surprise at the sudden appearance of a new army,were thrown into disorder. They fell back upon thecohorts sent to support them, and a general conster­nation followed.

formed wonders. Wounded as he was, he bravedevery danger; with his voice, with his hand, withevery effort still sustaining the combat. He fell withfury on the archers, and would have opened his way,had not the Rhsetian cohorts, with the Gauls and theVindelici, advanced their standards to oppose him.Indebted to his own exertions, and the vigour of hishorse, he escaped from the field; and, to disguise hisperson, besmeared his face with his own blood. Ifreport is to be credited, the Chaucians, then 'servingthe allies of Rome, knew his person, but connivedat his escape.
By the like gallant behaviour, or a similiar treach­ery, Inguiomer survived the havoc of the day. Ageneral carnage followed. Numbers endeavouring toswim across the Visurgis, perished in the attempt,overwhelmed with darts, or carried away by the vio­lence of the current. The multitude then plungedinto the water; obstructed one another; and, thebanks giving way, were crushed under the load. Somewere dastardly enough to seek their safety by climb­ing up the trees, where they hoped to skulk amongthe branches: but the Roman archers, in sport andderision, took aim at the fugitives; and in that man­ner, or by felling the trees, they were all destroyed.The victory was signal; and cost the Romans littleor no effusion of blood.
XVIII. The slaughter lasted from the fifth hour,to the close of day. The country, ten miles round,was covered with mangled bodies, and the arms ofthe vanquished. Among the spoils was found alarge quantity of fetters, which the barbarians, anti­cipating a certain victory, had prepared for the Ro­man prisoners. The legions on the field of battle pro­claimed Tiberius Imperator; and having raised amount, placed on the top of it a pile of German arms,as the trophies of victory, with an inscription at thebase, setting forth the names of the conquered na­tions.

suffered an eclipse, and storms and tempests burstfrom the angry elements. The guilt of the army wasthe cause of all. To avert impending vengeance, theonly expedient was to depart at once from a vile, in­auspicious camp, the scene of so many crimes, and,by due atonement, expiate their past offences in theirwinter quarters. In this persuasion the eighth legiondeparted; the fifteenth followed; while the ninth re­mained behind,'declaring aloud that they would waitfor orders from Tiberius: but they soon saw them­selves deserted, and therefore struck their tents, wil­ling to do by choice what in a little time would be anact of necessity. Peace and good order being thusrestored, Drusus judged it unnecessary to wait tillthe return of the deputies, and immediately set offfor Rome.
XXXI. About the same time, and from the samecauses, another sedition broke out among the legionsin Germany, supported by greater numbers, and everyway more alarming. The leaders of the mutiny flat­tered themselves that Germanicus, impatient of a newmaster, would resign himself to the will of the legions,and in that case they had no doubt but that everything would fall before him. Two armies in thatjuncture were formed on the banks of the Rhine; onein Upper Germany, commanded by Caius Silius; theother in Lower Germany under Aulus Csecina. Bothwere subordinate to Germanicus, the commander inchief, who was then in Gaul, holding the assembly ofthe states, and collecting the revenues of that nation.The forces under Silius had not as yet revolted: un­decided, wavering, and cautious, they judged it pru­dent to wait the issue of the mutiny begun by others.In Csecina's camp on the Lower Rhine the flame ofdiscord was kindled to the utmost fury. The one-and-twentieth and fifth legions began the insurrection;the first and the twentieth followed their example:they were all stationed together in a summer campon the confines of the Ubians. The campaign was in­active ; and as the calls of duty were slight, the timeof course was passed in repose and indolence.

Will any one argue, that men in office arc"to drudge in business, condemned to endless toil," without the means of repairing the waste of labour,"and without a comfort to sooth anxiety?" The apo­logist of dissipation and luxury carried his point. Withan audience of congenial manners, public vices, deco­rated with specious names, were public virtues. Ti­berius closed the debate. The times, he said, werenot ripe for a censor; but if corruption went on in­creasing, there would be no want of vigour to reformabuses of every kind.
XXXIV. In the course of these debates, Lucius Pisobroke out with vehemence against the reigning vicesof the times, the spirit of intrigue that prevailed inthe forum, the venality of the courts of justice, andthe band of public informers, who were ever armedwith accusations, and spread terror through all ranksand degrees of men. For his part, he abjured the cityof Rome. In some remote corner of the world, he wasdetermined to seek an obscure but safe retreat from'he villany of abandoned men. He spoke and left thesenate house. Tiberius heard him, but not withoutinward mortification. He endeavoured by everymeans in his power to appease his indignation; andexerted all his interest with Piso's relations, in orderto dissuade him from his purpose. In a short timeafter, the same eminent person gave another proof ofhis firmness. He had commenced a suit against Ur-gulania, a woman raised above the control of law bythe friendship of Livia. Disdaining to answer theprocess, this haughty favourite took shelter in the im­perial palace. Piso persisted in his demand, undis­mayed by the resentment of Livia, who consideredhis obstinacy as an affront to herself. Tiberiusthought fit to temporize with the passions of his mo-

the conduct of Publius Scipio, who, we are told, didthe same in Sicily, while Rome was still convulsed bythe distractions of the Punic war. Tiberius, as soonas he received advices from Egypt, condemned thisaffectation of foreign manners, but without asperity.Another point appeared to him of greater moment.Arrfong the rules established by Augustus, it was amaxim of state policy, that Egypt should be consider­ed as forbidden ground, which neither the senators,nor the Roman knights, should presume to tread,without the express permission of the prince. Thiswas, no doubt, a wise precaution. It was seen that,whoe v er made himself master of Alexandria, with thestrong holds, which by sea and land were the keys ofthe whole province, might, with a small force, makehead against the power of Rome, and, by blocking upthat plentiful cor n country, reduce all Italy to a fa­mine. Gcrmanicus, without authority, had enteredAlexandria ; and this, to the jealous temper of Tibe­rius, was little short of a state crime.
LX. Meanwhile, Germanicus, little suspecting ^hathe had incurred the emperor's displeasure, determinedto sail up the Nile. He set out from Canopus, a citybuilt by the Spartans, in memory of a pilot of thatname, who was buried on the spot, at the time whenMenelaus, on his return from Troy, was driven byadverse winds on the coast of Libya. From Canopus,the next place of note was a mouth of the river dedi­cated to Hercules, who was born, as the inhabitantscontend, in that country. He was, according tothem, the first of the heroic line; and his name, beingmade another term for virtue, was by the voice ofsucceeding ages bestowed on all who emulated theexample of the Egyptian worthy. Germanicus pro­ceeded to the magnificent ruins of the city of Thebes,where still was to be seen, on ancient obelisks, a pom­pous description, in Egyptian characters, of the'wealth and grandeur of the place. From the accountof an elderly priest, who was desired to interpret thehieroglyphics of his country, it appeared that Thebes,at one time, contained within her walls no less thanseven hundred thousand men, capable of bearing arms;

the people, indulge his taste for pleasure; let him passhis day in the glare of public spectacles, and his nightin social revelry, rather than live sequestered frommankind, without a joy to cheer him, in painful vigilsand the gloom of solitude brooding over his cares,and thinking only to engender mischief.
XXXVIII. The ruin of eminent citizens had not yetappeased the rage of Tiberius and, his crew of in­formers. An accusation was preferred by AnchariusPriscus against Csesius Cordus, proconsul of Crete,for peculation and violated majesty. The last arti­cle was, at that time, the burden of every prosecu­tion. Antistius Vetus, a man of the first consequencein Macedonia, had been accused of adultery, and ac-'quitted. This gave umbrage to Tiberius. He cen­sured the judges, and ordered Vetus to be tried onthe usual charge of violated majesty. He representedhim as a man of a turbulent spirit, and an accom­plice with Rhescuporis at the time when that barba­rian, having put his nephew, Cotys, to death, was onthe eve of a war with Rome. Vetus fell a sacrifice.He was interdicted from fire and water, with an ad­ditional sentence, that he should be confined to someisland not contiguous either to Macedonia or Thrace.
Since the partition of the latter kingdom betweenRhsemetalces and the sons of Cotys, to whom Tre-bellienus Rufus was appointed guardian, that countrycontinued in a state of tumult and hostility to Rome.The people saw, with minds exasperated, the griev­ances inflicted on the natives, and, having no pros­pect of redress, accused Trebellienus no less thanRhsemetalces. In the same juncture the Cselaletans,the Odrysseans, Dians, and other adjacent states, inone general revolt, had recourse to arms. They tookthe field under their own respective chiefs, men of noconsideration, and all by their meanness and incapa­city reduced to one common level. Hence no con­certed plan, no spirit of union. By one party thecountry was laid waste; another passed over mountHsemus, with a design to draw distant nations intotheir confederacy; while the most numerous and best

rage and violence, the purple standard which wasthere deposited. They broke open the doors; thoy| forced their way into the house; and, dragging theirgeneral out of his bed, with menaces of instant deathcompelled him to surrender the standard. Flushedwith this exploit, they ran wild through the streets;and meeting the deputies, then on their way to jointhe prince, they poured forth a torrent of opprobriouslanguage, and threatened a general massacre.
Plancus was the first object of their fury. That il­lustrious citizen could not, without dishonour to hischaracter, shrink back from a tumultuous rabble: hewas, however, compelled to take refuge in the campof the first legion. He there embraced the colours;and, laying hold of the eagles, thought himself pro­tected by the gods of the army. But even that sanc­tuary was no longer a place of shelter; the soldiersforgot the religion of the camp; and if Calpurnius,the eagle-bearer, had not made a stout resistance, adeed of horror, unheard of even among barbarians,had been impiously perpetrated; and the blood of a ,> Roman ambassador, in a Roman camp, had stainedthe altar of the gods. At the return of day, whenthe general, the men, and the actions of all might beclearly distinguished, Germanicus entered the camp.He ordered Plancus to be conducted to his presence,and seated him near himself on the tribunal. Hecomplained of the distractions of the'time; but im­puted what had happened not so much to the mad­ness of the soldiers, as to the vengeance of the gods.He explained the nature of the deputation f-om thesenate; he stated the rights of ambassadors; hepainted forth, in pathetic terms, the indignity offeredto a man of such high consideration as Plancus; andlamented the disgrace that befel the legion. The sol­diers heard him like men astonished, but not con­vinced. Germanicus thought proper to dismiss thedeputies; but, to guard their persons, ordered a de­tachment of the auxiliary horse to escort them.

trade of an informer; that detestable trade, which, bythe iniquity of the limes, and the daring wickednessof the vile and profligate, became afterwards thesource of wealth and splendour. Obscure and indi­gent, but bold and pragmatical, this man by secret in­formations pampered the cruelty of Tiberius, andwriggled himself into favour. By his detestable prac­tices he became formidable to the first characters inRome. He gained the ear of the prince, and the ha­tred of mankind; leaving an example, by which thewhole race of his followers rose from beggary andcontempt to wealth and power; till, having wroughtthe destruction of the most eminent citizens, they fellat last by their own pernicious arts. The accusationbrought by Csepio Crispinus, charged Marcelluswith having spoken defamatory words against Tibe­rius. The charge was big with danger, while theaccuser had the art to bring forward, from the life ofthe emperor, the worst of his vices; ascribing all tothe malignity of Marcellus. The words were believedto be spoken, because the facts were true.
Hispo, the pleader, added( that the accused hadplaced his own statue higher than the Csesars; and toa bust, from which he had struck off the head of Au­gustus, united that of Tiberius. The prince, who hadhitherto remained silent, rose abruptly; declaring, ina tone of vehemencs, that in a cause of that impor­tance he would give his vote openly, and under thesanction of an oath. By this expedient the same ob­ligation was to be imposed on the whole assembly.But even then, in that black period, expiring libertyshowed some signs of life. Cneius Piso had the spiritto ask, " In what rank, Ceesar, do you choose to give"your voice? If first, your opinion must be mine; if" last, I may have the misfortune to differ from you."Tiberius felt that his warmth had transported him toofar. He checked his ardour, and had the moderationto consent that Marcellus should be acquitted on thelaw of violated majesty. There remained behind acharge of peculation, and that was referred to theproper jurisdiction.

were all suppressed. It was also confidently said thatPiso did not lay violent hands on himself, but died bythe stroke of an assassin. For the truth of these as­sertions I do not mean to be answerable; I state thefacts as I heard them related by men with whom Iconversed in my youth; and the anecdotes of suchmen may be deemed worthy of attention.
Tiberius attended the next meeting of the senate.He there complained with seeming anxiety, that thedeath of Piso was ' intended to reflect dishonour onhimself. He sent for the freedman, who had receivedthe paper sealed up, as already stated, and inquiredparticularly about his master; how he passed the lastof his days ? and what happened in the course of thenig,ht? The man answered in some instances withcaution, and in others off his guard. The emperorproduced Piso's letter, and read it to the senate. Itwas nearly in the following words: " Oppressed by the4i malice of my enemies, and falling under a load of" imputed guilt, without a friend to espouse the truth," or shelter innocence, I call the immortal gods to wit-"ness, that to you, Csesar, I have through life pre-" served my faith inviolate. For your mother I have" ever felt the sincerest veneration. I conjure you" both to take my sons under your protection. Cneius" Piso is innocent. Nothing that Iiappened in Asia" can be imputed to him, since he remained, during the" whole time, at Rome. His brother Marcus, when I" returned to the province of Syria, was strenuous" against the measure. Would to heaven that I had"yielded to the advice of a young man, and that my44 authority had not silenced all opposition. For him" I offer my fervent prayers; let not the errors of the" father bring down ruin on the son. If in the course" of five-and-forty years I have been devoted to your" service; if Augustus made me his colleague in the4i consulship; if the remembrance of our early friend-4i ship can now avail; by all those ties I implore yourii mercy for my unhappy son. It is the request of44 a dying father; the last I shall ever make." Hemade no mention of Plancina.

rediles from all farther care about the business. Lux­ury went on with boundless profusion. It begansoon after the battle of Actium, and continued toflourish, for the space of a century, down to the timewhen Galba attained the imperial dignity. At thatperiod the manners changed, and temperance becamethe fashion. Of this revolution in the modes of lifea short account will not be improper. While the oldconstitution still subsisted, pomp and splendour wereoften the ruin of the most illustrious families. Toconciliate the favour of the populace, and of the al­lies of Rome, including even kings and princes, wasthe great object of a Roman citizen. In proportionto his wealth, his grandeur, and the magnificence ofhis retinue, his importance rose, and with-it the num­ber of his clients. But when the best blood in Romewas spilt by imperial tyranny, and to be eminent wasto be marked out for destruction; it became the inter­est of the great to lay aside all vain ostentation, andadopt a more humble plan of life. At the same time,a new race of men from the municipal towns, the co­lonies, and tire provinces, found their way, not onlyto Rome, but even into the senate. The strangersthus incorporated brought with them their naturalparsimony. In the course of a long life many of them,either by their own frugality, or a tide of success intheir affairs, accumulated immoderate riches; yeteven in affluence, avarice was their ruling passion.But the cause, which, above all others, contributed tothe revival of ancient economy, was the character ofVespasian; a man of primitive temperance and rigidausterity. All agreed to imitate so excellent a model.Respect for the priuce did more than all the pains andpenalties of the law. And yet, it may be true, thatin the nature of things there is a principle of rotation,in consequence of which the manners, like the seasons,are subject to periodical changes. Nor is it certainthat, in the former ages of the world, every thing wasbetter than in the times that succeeded.

I. The first form of government that prevailed atRome was monarchy. Liberty and the consulshipwere established by Lucius Junius Brutus. Dictatorswere created in sudden emergencies only. The juris­diction of the decemvirs did not extend beyond twoyears; and the consular authority of the military tri­bunes soon expired. The domination of Cinna endedin a short time; and that of Sylla was not of longduration. From Pompey and Crassus, the wholepower of the state devolved to Julius Csesar, and,after the struggle with Lepidus and Antony, centredm Augustus; who, under the mild and well-knowntitle of Prince of the Senate, took upon him themanagement of the commonwealth, enfeebled as itwas by an exhausting series of civil wars. But thememorable transactions of the old republic, as well inher day of adversity, as in the tide of success, havebeen recorded by writers of splendid genius. Evenin the time of Augustus there flourished a race ofauthors, from whose abilities that period might havereceived ample justice: but the spirit of adulationgrowing epidemic, the dignity of the historic charac­ter was lost. What has been transmitted to us con­cerning Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, can­not be received without great mistrust. During thelives of those emperors, fear suppressed or disfiguredthe truth; and after their deaths, recent feelings gavean edge to resentment. For this reason, it is my in­tention shortly to state some particulars relating toAugustus, chiefly towards the close of his life; andthence to follow downward the thread of my narra­

the same report that announced the death of Augustus,proclaimed Tiberius in possession of the supremepower.
VI. The first exploit of the new reign was the mur­der of Agrippa Posthumus. A centurion of undauntedresolution attacked him by surprise. Though unpro­vided with arms, the young man did not easily yield :he fell after a stout resistance. Of this event Tibe­rius made no report to the senate, content with hint­ing a pretended order of his deceased father, by whichthe centurion, charged with the custody of Agrippa'sperson, was commanded to despatch him, as soon as' the emperor breathed his last. Augustus, it is true,had arraigned the character and conduct of the youngman in terms of asperity; he had even banished himby a decree of the senate: but it is equally true, thathe never imbrued his hands in the blood of his kin­dred ; nor is it probable that, for the security of a step­son, he would have doomed to death a descendantfrom himself. The stronger presumption is, that Ti­berius and Livia, the former impelled by his dread ofa rival, and the latter, by the malice of a step-mother^were accomplices in the murder. When the assassin,in the military phrase, reported to Tiberius, that whathe had given in orders was duly executed, the replyof the new emperor was, that he had given no suchorders, and for what was done the centurion must an­swer before the senate.
A disavowal so very extraordinary gave the alarmto Sallustius Crispus, a minister then in favour, andtrusted with the secrets of the court. The warrantfor the execution had passed through his hands. Hedreaded a public examination; well aware that, whe­ther he disclosed the truth, or attempted to disguiseit, his own danger would, in either case, be preciselythe same. To ward off the blow, he remonstrated toLivia, that the secret counsels of the imperial family,the conduct of ministers, and the actions of the cen­turions, ought to be veiled from the public eye. Byreferring too much to the senate, the prince wouldweaken his own authority: that men should be ac­

LX. To strengthen the foundation of his ownpower was the constant policy of Tiberius. Intent onthat object, he still preserved the forms of the consti­tution, and amused the senate with a phantom of li­berty. All petitions from the provinces were referredto that assembly. About this time, the right of hav­ing sanctuaries, and of multiplying the number with­out limitation, was assumed by all the cities ofGreece. The temples in that country were crowdedby the most abandoned slaves; debtors screened them­selves from their creditors, and criminals fled fromjustice. The magistrates were no longer able to con­trol a seditious populace, who carried their crimes,under a mask of piety, to the altar of their gods. Anorder was therefore made, that the several citiesshould send their deputies to Rome, with a state oftheir respective claims. Some places, finding theirpretensions brought to the test, thought proper to de­cline the inquiry. The rights of others were foundedon traditional superstition; and superstition was notwilling to renounce her errors. Some of the citiesrelied on the merit of their ancestors in the service ofRome. The business came at length to a hearing. Aday more august and splendid cannot be figured tothe imagination. We now behold a Roman senatesitting in judgment on the grants of the old republic;discussing the treaties and conventions of confederatenations; deliberating on the acts,of kings, while kingswere able to make a stand against the power of Rome;and, above all, reviewing the various systems of reli­gion, which had been for ages established in the be­lief of mankind. These were the important subjects;and to give still greater dignity to the scene, the se­nate met, as was the practice in good times, withauthority to inquire, and liberty to determine.

It was stated in their behalf, thatDiana and Apollo were not, as generally supposed,born in the ishf of Delos, but in the Ortygian Grove,on the banks of the river Cenchri^, which flows with­in the territories of Ephesus.

to his father's measures, had a portion of the realm;the rest was granted to the son of Cotys, then underage. During their minority, Trebellienus Rufus, ofpnetorian rank, undertook the government of thekingdom in trust for the heir of Cotys, according tothe precedent of former times, when the senate sentMarcus Lepidus to administer the affairs of Egypt inthe capacity of regent and guardian to the childrenof Ptolemy. Rhescuporis was conveyed to Alexan­dria; and there attempting to make his escape, orperhaps unjustly charged with that design, he wasseized and put to death.
LXVIII. About the same time Vonones, who, ashas been mentioned, was detained in Cilicia, made alike attempt, but with no better success. Havingcorrupted the guards, he intended to push his wayinto Armenia, and thence to the Albanians and He-niochians, flattering himself that he should be able topenetrate into Scythia, and there obtain protectionfrom the reigning king, who was his near relation.With this intent he went on a hunting party; and*having watched his opportunity, betook himself toflight. Turning off from the sea-coast he struck intothe woods, and rode at full speed towards the riverPyramus. The inhabitants, on the first alarm, de­molished the bridges. The river was not fordable.Vonones was found wandering along the banks, andby order of Vibius Fronto, the commander of the ca­valry, loaded with fetters. He did not long survive.Remnius, a resumed veteran, had been entrustedwith the custody of his person. This man, in a sud­den transport of pretended passion, drew his swordand ran the unhappy prince through the body. Thesecret cause of this violent act cannot now be ascer­tained : the general opinion was, that the soldier hadbeen bribed to favour the king's escape, and, ratherthan be detected as an accomplice, choose to be anassassin.

reason the more disastrous; no warning given, and byconsequence no time to escape. The open fields, insuch dreadful convulsions, are the usual refuge; but Jthe earth opening in various places, all who attemptedto fly were buried in the yawning caverns. Hills aresaid to have sunk, and valleys rose to mountains.Quick flashes of lightning showed all the horrors ofthe scene. The city of Sardes suffered most, and wasrelieved in proportion to the distress of the inhabi­tants. Besides a remission for five years of all taxes,whether due to the public treasury, or the coffers ofthe prince, Tiberius promised a supply of one hun­dred thousand great sesterces. The city of Magnesia,situate near mount Sipylus, suffered, in the next de,'gree, and was considered accordingly. The inhabi­tants of Temnos, Philadelphia, Egcoa, and Apollonia,with the cities of Hierocsesarea, Myrina, Cyme, Tmo-lus, as also the Mosthenians, and the'people called theMacedonians of Hyrcania, were, for the like term offive years, exempted from all manner of imposts. Thesenate resolved to send a person of their own order :to make an estimate of the mischief, and grant suita- 'ble relief. The affairs of Asia were at that time ad­ministered by a man of consular dignity. To avoidthe jnalousy incident to officers of equal rank, Mar­cus Aletus, who had risen no higher than the officeof prsetor, was the person commissioned to superin­tend the business.
XLVIII. Besides these acts/of public munificence,Tiberius showed, in matters of a private nature, »spirit of liberality that did him the highest honour.The estate of /Emilia Musa, who was possessed of alarge fortune, and died intestate, leaving no lawfulheir, was claimed to the prince's use by the officer ofthe imperial exchequer. Tiberius renounced his rightin favour of iEmilius Lepidus, who seemed to standin some degree of relation to the deceased. He gaveup, in like manner, the rich possessions, of Patuleius,a Roman knight; and, though a considerable legacywas left to himself, he resigned the whole to MarcusServllius, upon the ground of a former will, duly at­tested, in which gervilius was constituted sols heir.

" passions of the profligate seducer. The presence of" the husband is scarce sufficient to guard the sanc-" tity of the marriage bed: what must be the conse-" quence, if they are separated, and as it were," divorced for a number of years ? In that interval," the nuptial union may be obliterated from the mind." Let us, if we can, prevent disorder in the provinces;" but let us not forget the manners of the capital."
In this debate Drusus delivered his sentiments. Hetouched upon the subject of his own marriage, andadded, that the princes of the imperial house wereliable to the frequent,necessity of visiting distant pro­vinces. How often did it happen that Augustus madea progress in the West, and in the East, accompaniedby Livia his wife ? As to himself, he had commandedin Illyricum, and was ready, if the state required, toserve in any part of the empire; but he should servewith regret, if he was to be torn from an affectionatewife, the faithful mother of all his children. In con­sequence of these reasonings, CiEcina's motion fell tothe ground.
XXXV. The senate at their next meeting receivedletters from Tiberius, in which, after complaining ob­liquely that the burden of all public business wasthrown on himself, he named Manius Lepidus andJunius Blsesus for the proconsulship of Africa; leav­ing the choice of one of them to the determination ofthe fathers. Both were heard: Lepidus, with a de­gree of earnestness, desired to be excused; allegingthe infirmities of his constitution, and the care due tohis children, who, except a daughter then fit for themarried state, were all of tender years. Lepidus hadstill a better reason, but he chose to suppress it: itwas, nevertheless, well understood that Blsesus wasuncle to Sejanus, and of course had the prevailinginfluence. Blsesus in his turn declined the office, butwith affected coyness. Flattery knew on which sideits interest lay; and, by consequence, the slaves ofpower knew how to conquer such feeble reluctance.Blsesus was of course appointed.

The disgrace of theRoman arms touched him more than the glory thataccrued to the barbarians. He resolved to expiatethe infamy by a dreadful punishment, founded, in­deed, upon ancient precedent, and recorded m history ;but in modern times fallen into disuse. He orderedthe cohort, whose behaviour had been so ignominious,to be deoimated : every man upon whom the lot fell,died under repeated blows of the cudgel. The conse­quence of this severity was, that a body of five hun­dred veterans, stationed in garrison at Thala, main­tained their post against the attempts of Tacfarinas,and even routed the troops lately flushed with vic­tory. In this action, Rufus Helvius, a common sol­dier, obtained the glory of saving the life of a Romancitizen. He was rewarded by Apronius with a spearand collar. Tiberius ordered the civic crown to beadded, observing, at the same time, that the proconsulhad the power of granting that reward : yet he cen­sured the omission without asperity, pleased thatsomething was reserved for himself.

XXIV. The storms in other seas are inconsider­able, when compared to the fury of a northern tem­pest. The ocean in those parts is more boisterousthan in any other of the known world, and the rigourof Germany surpasses that of any other climate.The danger of the fleet was, by consequence, morealarming; the magnitude, as well as the novelty ofthe mischief, exceeding any former voyage, under­taken by the Romans. No friendly shore at hand;every coast in the possession of savage enemies; thesea of a depth incredible; vast in circumference, and,according to the received opinion, without any nationtowards the north, or any continent to fix its boun­dary. A number of ships went to the bottom; manywere wrecked on distant islands, secluded from thecommerce of man. The soldiers who were cast onshore, perished by famine, or prolonged a wretchedexistence by feeding on the carcases of horses thrown, up by the sea.
The vessel in which Germanicus sailed, was drivenfar from the fleet, to the coast inhabited by the Chau- ,cians. There the disconsolate prince passed wholedays and nights among pointed rocks, wandering onthe prominent beach, his eyes fixed on the brawlingdeep, and. his heart imputing to himself the wholecalamity. It was with difficulty that his friends re­strained him from burying himself in the same wavesthat swallowed up so many gallant soldiers. Atlength the storm abated.

The crippled veseels were drawn in towby such as were less disabled: Germanicus refittedthe fleet with all possible expedition: and, as soon asmight be, ordered some of the ships to coast along theislands, in search of the soldiers who had been castaway.

The choice of a vestal virgin, in theoom of Occia, who had been, with the greatest sanc-ty of manners, president of the order during thepace of seven-and-fifty years, was by Tiberius re-jrred to the senate. Fonteius Agrippa, and Domi-tus Pollio, made each of them an offer of his daugh-3r. The emperor commended their zeal for the iublic service. The daughter of Pollio was preferred,ler mother had never known but one husband, and,till continuing to live with him, gave an example ofonjugal fidelity; whereas the divorce of Agrippa wasconsidered as a blemish in the family. That reason,tnd that only, determined the present choice. Theepulse of the disappointed candidate was softened byi present of a thousand great sesterces, granted byTiberius.

XXXIX. On the first intelligence of this revolt,Publius Velleius, who commanded an army in theneighbourhood, sent a detachment of horse and lightinfantry in pursuit of the insurgents, who spread them­selves over the country, either with a view to plun­der, or to reinforce their numbers. He himself marchedin force to raise the siege. He was successful inevery quarter: the freebooters were put to the sword;and dissensions breaking out among the besiegers,Rhsemetalces made a sally in the moment when theRoman army came up to his relief. The barbariansabandoned the place. Of these events, however pros­perous, there is no room to speak in the pomp ofmilitary language: a rabble of savages, without dis­cipline, and almost without weapons, cannot be calledan army; nor was that a battle, where the enemy wascut to pieces, without the effusion of Roman blood.
XL. In the course of the same year a rebellionbroke out among the cities of Gaul, occasioned by theload of debt that oppressed the common people. Theprincipal leaders of the revolt were Julius Floras andJulius Sacrovir; the former a man of weight amongthe Treveri, and the latter among the jEduans. Theywere both of illustrious birth. Their ancestors haddeserved well of the Romans, and, for their services,received the freedom of the city, at a time when thatprivilege was rare, and the reward of merit only. Bythese incendiaries secret meetings were held; thefierce and daring were drawn into the league, toge­ther with such as languished in poverty, or, beingconscious of their crimes, had nothing left but to growdesperate in guilt. Florus undertook to kindle theflame of rebellion in Belgia; and Sacrovir to rousethe neighbouring Gauls. The plan thus settled, theycaballed in private, held frequent meetings, and leftno topic untouched that could inflame the minds ofthe people. " Tributes," they said, " were levied" with unabating rigour; usurious interest oppressed" the poor, and their haughty masters continued to

LIV. From Athens Germanicus sailed to the islandof Eubcea, and thence to Lesbos, where Agrippina wasdelivered of a daughter, called Julia, the last of herchildren. From Lesbos he pursued his voyage alongthe coast of Asia; and, after visiting Perinthus andByzantium, two cities of Thrace, sailed through thestraits of the Propontic, into the Euxine Sea, led bycuriosity to visit places renowned in story. In his pro­gress he attended every where to the complaints ofthe inhabitants, whom he found distracted by theirown intestine divisions, or labouring under the tyran­ny of the magistrates. He redressed grievances, andestablished good order, wherever he went.
On his return from the Euxine, he intended to visitSamothraeia, famous for its rites and mysteries; butthe wind springing up from the north, he was obligedto bear away from the coast. He viewed the ruins ofTroy, and the remains of antiquity in that part of theworld, renowned for so many turns of fortune, thetheatre of illustrious actions, and the origin of theRoman people. He landed next at Colophon, to con­sult the oracle of the Clarian Apollo. The responsesat this place were not delivered, like those at Delphos,by a Pythian maid: a priest officiates, chosen by cus­tom out of certain privileged families, and generallya citizen of Miletus. From such as apply to him, herequires nothing but their number and their names.Content with these particulars, he descends into acavern; and, after drinking from a secret spring,though untinctured with learning, and a stranger topoetry, he breaks out in a strain of enthusiastic verse,on the subject of every man's hopes and fears. Heis said to have foretold the approaching fate of Ger­manicus, but in the oracular style, dark and enigma­tical.
LV. Piso, in the mean time, impatient to executehis evil purposes, made his entry into Athens, andwith the tumult of a rude and disorderly train, alarm­ed the city. In a public speech he thought fit to de­claim against the inhabitants, obliquely glancing atGermanicus, who, he said, by ill-judged condescen­sions, had impaired the dignity of the Roman name..

young man of a free and open disposition, unhack­neyed in the ways of business, could have acted withthat guarded reserve, which marked the veteran inpolitics.
IX. Piso crossed the gulf of Dalmatia, and, leavinghis ships at Ancona, went forward to Picenum. Fromthat place he pursued his journey on the Flaminianroad, and on his way met a legion marching fromPannonia to Rome, in order to proceed from thenceto serve in Africa. This incident was variously can­vassed by the people. A criminal, it was said, pre­sumes to join the soldiers on their march, and evenwaylays them at. their quarters, to curry favour withhis military friends. Piso heard of these complaints,and, to avoid suspicion, or because it is the nature ofguilt to be always wavering and irresolute, at Narnihe embarked on the Nar, and, sailing down the Ti­ber, landed on the Field of Mars, near the tomb of theCsesars. This was another causo of popular discon­tent: in open day, amidst a crowd of spectators, heand his wife Plancina made their appearance; theformer surrounded by a tribe of clients, and the latterby a train of female attendants; all with an air of gay-ety, bold, erect, and confident. Piso's house overlook­ed the forum; preparations were made for a sumptu­ous entertainment; the scene was adorned with splen­did decorations: and, from the nature of the situation,nothing could remain a secret. The whole was ex­posed to the public eye.
X. On the following day Fulcinius Trio exhibited anaccusation before the consuls. To this proceedingVitellius, Veranius and others, who had attendedGermanicus into Asia, made strong objections; alleg­ing that Trio had not so much as a colour to entitlehim to the conduct of the prosecution. As to them­selves they did. not mean to stand forth as accusers;but they had the last commands of Germanicus, andto the facts within their knowledge intended to ap­pear as witnesses. Trio waved his pretensions, butstill claimed a right to prosecute for former misde­meanors. That liberty was allowed. Applicationwas made to the emperor, that the cause might be

XXVII. About this time, Libo Drusus, descendedfrom the Scribonian family, was accused of a conspi­racy against the state. The history of this transactionin all its stages, its rise, its progress, and its final issue,shall be here laid open. The detail will not be unin­teresting; since we are now arrived at that blackperiod, which engendered that race of men, who, fora series of years, were the scourge and pest of so­ciety. Libo owed his ruin to his intimacy with Fir-mius Catus, a member of the senate. Catus saw inhis friend, besides the impetuosity of youth, a cast ofmind susceptible of vain illusions and superstitiouscredulity. He saw that the judicial astrology of theChaldseans, the mysteries of the Magi, and the inter­preters of dneams, would be sure to make their im­pression on a wild and distempered imagination. Insuch a mind the flame of ambition might be easilykindled. With that intent, he urged the dignity ofLibo's ancestors: Pompey was his great grand-father; -Scribonia, once the wife of Augustus, was his aunt;the two young Csesars were his relations; and hishouse was crowded with images, that displayed anillustrious line of ancestors. Havmg thus inflamedhis pride, he contrived to engage the young man in acourse of luxury, and, by consequence, to involvehim in a load of debt. He watched him closely in thehour of wild profusion, and in the scenes of distressthat followed; affecting with tender regard to be hisconstant companion, yet lying in wait for evidence;and playing the part of a friend, to be at last a per­nicious enemy.
XXVIII. Having procured a competent number ofwitnesses, and among them such of the slaves as knewtheir master's course of life, Catus demanded an au­dience of the emperor. By the means of FlaccusVescularious, a Roman knight, much in the conn­

to the rage of legislation. But the respite was butshort. The fiery genius of Lepidus preferred a num­ber of seditious decrees, and the tribunes of the peo­ple, resuming their ancient powers, alarmed the statewith tumult and popular commotions. The generalgood was no longer thought of: new characters ap­peared in the great scene of public business, and newstatutes were enacted. In a corrupt republic vice in­creased, and laws were multiplied.
XXVIII. Pompey at length, in his third consulship,was chosen to correct abuses, and introduce a refor­mation of manners. His remedies were more perni­cious than the mischief. He made laws, and brokethem; he had recourse to arms, and by force of armswas ruined. From that time, during a period oftwenty years, the rage of civil discord threw everything into confusion. Justice was silent; tho man­ners were corrupted; vice triumphed with impunity,and virtue met with sure destruction. At length,Augustus in his sixth consulship, finding himself esta­blished without a rival, repealed the acts passed byhimself during the triumvirate, and gave a new sys­tem, useful indeed to the public tranquillity, but sub­versive of the constitution; fit only for the govern­ment of one. The chains of slavery were closelyriveted, and spies of state were appointed. To ex­cite and animate the diligence of those new o'fFicers,the law Papia Poppsea held forth rewards. By thatlaw, the people, under the fiction of universal parent,were declared heirs to the vacant possessions ofsuch as lived in celibacy, regardless of the privilegesannexed to the paternal character. To enforce thisregulation, informers were encouraged. The geniusof those men knew no bounds: they harassed thecity of Rome, and stretched their harpy-hands allover Italy. Wherever they found a citizen, theyfound a man to be plundered. Numbers were ruin­ed, and all were struck with terror. To stop the pro­gress of the mischief, Tiberius ordered a set of com­missioners, to be drawn by lot; five of consular rank,five prsetorians, and a like number from the body ofthe seriate. Under their direction the law was ex­

lately raised, by hasty levies, on this side of the Rhine.He marched himself at the head of an equal legion­ary force, and double the number of auxiliaries. Onthe ruins of a fort, formerly built on Mount Taurusby his father Drusus, he raised a fortification, andproceeded by rapid marches against the Cattians. Tosecure his retreat, he left behind him Lucius Apro-nius, with orders to work at the roads, and embankthe rivers. The dryness of the season, uncommon inthose parts, and the low bed of waters in the rivers,favoured his expedition; but, before his return, the fallof heavy rains, and the overflow of torrents, mightlay the country under water. His arrival was so lit­tle expected by the Cattians, that their women andchildren were either taken prisoners, or put to thesword. The young and able-bodied made their escapeby swimming across the Adrana. From the oppositeliank they attemped to hinder a bridge from beingthrown over the river; but by a fierce discharge fromthe engines, and a volley of darts, they were drivenfrom their post. They offered terms of peace, butwithout success. Numbers submitted at discretion:the rest abandoned their villages, and fled for shelterinto the woods. The country round was laid waste;Mattium, the capital, was destroyed by fire; and theopen plains were made a desert. Germanicus marchedhis army back towards the Rhine, the barbarians neverdaring to harass the rear, as is their practice, whenpretending to retreat in a panic, they wheel about ona sudden, and return to the charge. The Cheruscansmeditated a sudden attack in favour of the Cattians;but Csecina, with an army of observation, spread sowarm an alarm, that the enterprise was dropt. TheMarsians, more bold and desperate, risked a battle,and were defeated.

bate hy the same Corbulo. The highways, he said,were in a bad condition throughout Italy, neglectedevery where, and in some places impassable. He im­puted the mischief to the fraudulent practices of con­tractors, and the inattention of the magistrates. Hewas desired to superintend the business; but the ad­vantage, whatever it was, that accrued to the public,did not counterbalance the ruin of individuals, whoBuffered, both in reputation and fortune, by the harshdecision of Corbulo, and the confiscation of theireifects.
XXXII. In a short time after, the senate receiveddespatches from Tiberius, with intelligence thatAfrica was again alarmed by the incursions of Tae-farinas. The occasion, the emperor said, required aproconsul of military talents, and vigour equal to thefatigues of war; but the choice was left to the judg­ment of the fathers. Sextus Pompeius seized thisopportunity to launch out in a bitter invective againstMarcus Lepidus, v'iom he styled a man void of cou­rage, destitute of fortune, a disgrace to his ancestors,and by no means fit to be entrusted with the go­vernment of Asia, which had then fallen to his lot.The senate was of a different opinion. What wascalled want of courage, according to them, was mild­ness of disposition; his indigence was a misfortune,not a disgrace; nor could it be deemed a fair objec­tion to a man, who, in narrow circumstances, sup- .ported the dignity of his ancestors, and lived in ho­nourable poverty, with an unblemished character. Hewas therefore declared proconsul of Asia. Thechoice of a governor to command in Africa, was by adecree, reserved for the decision of the emperor.
XXXIII. In the course of the debate, a motion wasmade by Csecina Severus, that the governors of pro­vinces should be no longer accompanied by theirwives. He prefaced the business with repeated de­clarations, that between him and his wife, who hadbrought him six children, the truest harmony subsist­ed ; and yet the law, which he now proposed, hadever been the rule of his own conduct; insomuch thatin a series of forty years, during which time he had

IX. The Visnrgis flowed between the Romans andCheruscans. On the opposite bank Arminius pre­sented himself. He was attended by the principalGerman chiefs. His business was to know whetherGermanicus was with the army? being answered inthe affirmative, he desired an interview with his bro­ther, known to the Romans by the name of Flavius;a man of strict fidelity, who some years before, underthe conduct of Tiberius, lost an eye in battle. Themeeting was permitted. Flavius advanced to themargin of the river. Arminius, from the oppositeside, saluted him; and having ordered his guards tofall back, required that the Roman archers shouldwithdraw in like manner. The two brothers beingleft to themselves, Arminius fixed his eye on Flavius;and, Whence, he said, that deformity of feature ? Hewas told the battle and the place where it happened.And what, continued Arminius, has been your recom­pense ? I have received, said Flavius, an augmenta­tion of pay, a military chain, an ornamented crown,and other honours. Arminius burst into a laugh ofscorn and indignation. " They are the wages," hesaid, " of a slave cheaply purchased."
X. A warm altercation followed. Flavius talkedof the majesty of Rome, the power of the Csesars,the weight with which their vengeance falls on theobstinate, and their clemency to the nations willingto submit. He added, "Your wife and son are in the" hands of Rome, and neither of them has been" treated like a captive." Arminius, on the contrary,urged the rights of men born in freedom, the lawsof his country, the plan of ancient liberty, and thegods of Germany. " Your mother," he said, "joins"with me in earnest supplication; we both conjure"you not to desert your family; not to betray your* friends, nor prefer the detested name of a traitor, to" the vast renown of commanding armies in the de-" fence of your country." By degrees their passionsrose to a pitch of fury, insomuch that the river couldnot have restrained them from deciding their quarrel

was to issue out of the treasury. The tribunes wereallowed to preside in the Circus, dressed in trium­phal robes, but the pomp of splendid chariots was ex­pressly denied. The annual celebration of thosegames was afterwards transferred, from the tribunes,to that particular prator who has jurisdiction in allcauses between strangers and the citizens of Kome.
XVI. Such was the situation of affairs at Rome,when a fierce and violent mutiny broke out amongthe legions in Pannonia. For this insurrection therewas no other motive than the licentious spirit, whichis apt to show itself in the beginning of a new reign,and the hope of private advantage in the distractionsof a civil war. A summer-camp had been formedfor three legions, under the command of Julius Blse-sus. The death of Augustus, and the accession ofTiberius, being known to the army, the generalgranted a suspension of military duty, as an intervalof grief or joy. The soldiers grew wanton in idle­ness; dissensions spread amongst them; the vile andprofligate had their circular audiences; sloth andpleasure prevailed; and all were willing to exchangea life of toil and discipline, for repose and luxury.There happened to be in the camp a busy incendiary,by name Percennius, formerly a leader of theatricalfactions, and'ribw a common soldier; a man fluent inwords, and by his early habits versed in tho art ofexciting tumult and sedition. Over the weak and ig­norant, and such as felt their minds alarmed withdoubts and fears about the future condition of theservice, this pragmatical follow began to exert his in­fluence. In the 'dead of night he mixed in cabals;and never failed at the close of day, when the soberand well disposed retired to their tents, to draw to­gether the idle and most abandoned. Having gaineda number of proselytes, he stood forth the orator ofsedition, and harangued his confederates in the fol­lowing manner:

LVI. Tiberius gained by these proceedings a con­siderable share of popularity. His moderation in thebusiness of the intended reform, gave satisfaction toall ranks and conditions. The people saw, with plea­sure, the tribe of informers disappointed in theirviews. In this favourable moment, Tiberius, by let­ters to the senate, desired that his son Drusus mightbe invested with the tribunitian dignity. That spe­cious title, importing nothing less than sovereignpower, was invented by Augustus, at a time whenthe name of king or dictator was not only unconsti­tutional, but universally detested. And yet a newname was wanted to overtop the magistrates andthe forms of the constitution. In that power usurped,Marcus Agrippa became his colleague ; and, after hisdeath, Tiberius Nero succeeded. By the last promo­tion, it was the policy of Augustus to mark out theline of succession, and thereby check the views of,as- ,piring men. He was sure that Tiberius would act anunder part, and, besides, his own name was a tower ofstrength. Tiberius, in the present juncture, followedthe precedent left by Augustus. During the life ofGermanrcus, he held the balance even between thetwo young princes, reserving to himself the power ofdeciding when he should see occasion. In the letter,which opened the matter to the senate, after invokingthe gods, and fervently praying that the measuremight be of advantage to the commonwealth, he in­troduced the character of Drusus, but in a guardedstyle, never exceeding the bounds of truth. Theprince, he, said, had a wife and three children, andwas then of the age, which he himself had attainedwhen raised by Augustus to the same honour. Noreould the favour now requested, be deemed prema­ture. Drusus had gone through a probation of eightyears; the proofs of his merit were, seditions quelled,wars happily terminated, the splendour of a triumph,and two consulships. There was therefore no dangerthat he would be a novice in public business.

XXV. The next care of the senate was to soften therigour of the law Papia Poppsea; a law made by Au­gustus in the decline of life, when the Julian institu­tions were found ineffectual. The policy was, toenforce, by additional sanctions, the penalties of celi­bacy, and thereby increase the revenue. Marriage,however, was not brought into fashion. To be with­out heirs was still considered as a state that gave greatadvantages. Prosecutors multiplied, and numberswere every day drawn into danger. Informers were,the interpreters of justice; and chicane and malicewrought the ruin of families. The community la­boured, at first, under the vices of the times, alidafterwards, under the snares of law. From this re­flection if we here go back to trace the origin of civilinstitutions, and the progress of that complex systemwhich has grown up to harass mankind, the digressionwill not be incurious, nor altogether foreign to ourpurpose. , ' *
XXVI. In the early ages of the world, men led alife of innocence and simplicity. Free from irregularpassions, they knew no corruption of manners; andvoid of guilt, they had no need of laws. In the na­tural emotion of the heart they found incitements tovirtue, and rewards were unnecessary. Having noinordinate desires, they coveted nothing, and pains'and penalties were unknown. In process of time, whenall equality was overturned, and, in the place of tem­perance and moderation, ambition and violence beganto trample on the rights of man; then monarchy wasestablished, in several nations unlimited, absolute,and flourishing at this hour. Some states, indeed, intheir first formation, or, at least, soon after they hadmade an experiment of kings, preferred a governmentby law; and law, in its origin, was like the mannersof the age, plain and simple.

1. During the consulship of Sisenna StatiliusTaurus and Lucius Libo, the oriental kingdoms, and,by consequence, the Roman provinces were throwninto commotion. The name of discord was lightedup among the Parthians. That restless people hadsued for a king: at the hands of Rome; and after ac­knowledging his title, as a descendant from the lineof the Arsacidcs, began with their natural levity toAespise him, as an alien to the crown. Vononcs was'he name of this unpopular prince: he had been for­merly sent by his father Phraates as an hostage toAugustus. The Eastern monarch made head againstthe armies of Rome, and had driven her generals outof his dominions ; but he endeavoured, notwithstand­ing, by every mark of respect, to conciliate the friend­ship of Augustus. As a pledge of sincerity, he wentthe length of delivering up to the custody of the Ro­mans even his own children, not so much with a de­sign to avert the terror of their arms, as from wantof confidence in the fidelity of his own subjects.

After the death of Phraates, and thc*kings whosucceeded him, the leading men of the nation, tired ofcivil slaughter, sent Ambassadors to Rome, with in­structions to invite Vonones, tho eldest son of Phra­ates, to the throne of his ancestors.

the commonwealth had no longer an army engagedin the cause of public liberty. The younger Pompeyreceived a total overthrow on the coast of Sicily;Lepidus was deprived of his legions; and Marc An­tony fell on his own sword. In that situation thepartisans of Julius Csesar had no leader but Octavius,who laid aside the invidious title of Triumvir, con­tent with the more popular name of Consul, and withthe tribunitian power, which he professed to assumefor the protection of the people. In a little time, whenhe had allured to his interest the soldiery, by a pro­fusion of largesses, the people by distribution of corn,and the minds of men in general by the sweets ofpeace, his views grew more aspiring. By degrees,and almost imperceptibly, he drew into his own handsthe authority of the senate, the functions of the ma­gistrates, and the administration of the laws. Tothese encroachments no opposition was made. Thetrue republicans had perished either in the field ofbattle, or by the rigour of proscriptions: of the re­maining nobility, the leading men were raised to.wealth and honours, in proportion to the alacrity withwhich they courted the yoke; and all who in the dis­traction of the times had risen to affluence, preferredimmediate ease and safety to the danger of contend­ing for ancient freedom. The provinces acquiescedunder the new establishment, weary of the mixed au­thority of the senate and people ; a mode of govern­ment long distracted by contentions among the great,and in the end rendered intolerable by the avarice ofpublic magistrates; while the laws afforded a feebleremedy, disturbed by violence, defeated by intrigue,and undermined by bribery and corruption.

Thedeceased was the first of his house that rose to theconsulship. When it was afterwards necessary toregulate the classes of the equestrian order, he wasfor that purpose advanced to the dignity of censor.In the course of his time he accumulated an immo­derate fortune, and laid the foundation of that rankand splendour, in which his family flourished afterhim.
The ancestors of Crispus were of equestrian rank.By the maternal line, he was grand-nephew to CaiusSallustius, the accomplished Roman historian. Beingadopted by that illustrious writer, he assumed the fa­mily name; and, though the road to honours lay openbefore him, the example of Msecenas was the model,on which he formed his conduct. Never aspiring tothe rank of senator, he lived in a degree of splendourthat eclipsed the consular magistrates, and even thecommanders of armies, who had triumphed for theirvictories. The austerity of ancient manners was tohis taste. In his apparel and equipage he was gayand costly; in his style of living, fond of elegance,and even of luxury. Uniting in his character oppo­site qualities, he was at once a man of pleasure, anda statesman of consummate ability. The vigour of hismind, though often relaxed in indolence, was such asqualified him for the most arduous affairs. Whenoccasion called, he returned to business with an clas­tic spring, that showed he gained new strength frominactivity. While Msecenas lived and flourished,Crispus acted the second character. Succeeding af­terwards to that minister, he took the lead in the ca­binet, the first in favour, and in all secret transactionsthe confidential manager.

Thefriends of the dying prince clasped his hands, andbound themselves by a solemn oath to revenge hisdeath, or perish in the attempt.
LXXII. Germanicus turning to his wife, and fix­ing his eyes upon her, earnestly conjured her by thememory of her husband, and by their mutual chil­dren, to abate from the pride and fierceness of her' disposition. To bend to the stroke of adversity, andat her return to Rome not to provoke by vain com­petition the resentment of enemies too high in power,was all that was now left.—Thus far with an audiblevoice: he then whispered a secret caution, which wassupposed to point at the malignity of Tiberius. In ashort time after he breathed his last. The provinceslamented their loss; he was honoured by kings, andregretted by the neighbouring nations: such was hisequal behaviour to the allies of Rome, and such thehumanity that endeared him even to the enemy.Graceful in his person, he charmed by his affability;beloved, when heard; admired, when only seen; and,in the highest elevation, great without arrogance, hemaintained the dignity of his rank, yet never gaveenvy reason to repine at his success.

lately joined the army. Upon the first intelligenceof the death of Augustus, these men, long addictedto licentiousness, and averse from labour, began topractise upon the ruder minds of their fellow soldiers.The time, they said, was come, when the veteransmight claim their dismission from the service; whenthe young soldier might augment his pay; when thearmy in general might redress their grievances, andretaliate the cruelty of the centurions. It was not,as in Pannonia, a single Pereennius that inflamed themutiny; nor weie these arguments urged to men whosaw on every side of them superior armies, and ofcourse trembled while they mediated a revolt. Therewere numbers of busy incendiaries, and many mouthsto bawl sedition. Their doctrine was, that the fateof Rome was in their hands; by their victories theempire flourished; by their valour Germany was sub­dued; and from the country which they had con­quered, the emperors of Rome were proud to derivea title to adorn their names.
XXXII. Csecina saw the danger, but made no ef­fort to suppress it. The malcontents were numerous,and their frenzy above all control; insomuch that thegeneral no longer retained, his usual firmness. Thetumult broke out at once: the soldiers fell upon thecenturions, the old and lasting cause of military dis­content, and in every insurrection the first to fall asacrifice. They seized their victims, and withoutmercy dashed them on the ground; in every legionthe centurions amounted to sixty; an equal numberfell on each of them. The soldiers laid on with theircudgels; they wounded, maimed, and mangled theirdevoted officers; and, to complete their vengeance,cast them dead, or ready to expire, over the intrench-Wents. Numbers were thrown into the Rhine. Onein particular, by name Septimius, fled to the tribunal;and clasping the knees of his general, hoped there tofind a sanctuary. The soldiers demanded him withcontumacy, and Csecina was obliged to give him totheir fury. Cassius Chserea the same who afterwardsimmortalized his name by the death of Caligula, was

protect him. The quarrel would have laid a sceneof blood, if the soldiers of the ninth legion had not, byentreaty, or by menacing the obstinate, appeased thefury of both parties.
XXIV. When the account of these transactionsreached Tiberius, that abstruse and gloomy temper,which loved to brood in secret over all untowardevents, was so deeply aifected, that he resolved, with­out delay, to despatch his son Drusus, with others ofhigh rank, and two prsetorian cohorts, to quell the in­surrection. In their instructions no decisive orderswere given; they were left to act as emergenciesmight require. To the cohorts was added a selectdetachment, with a party of the pratorian horse, andthe flower of the Germans, at that time the body­guard of the emperor. In the train which accompa­nied Drusus, Elius Sejanus was appointed, by hiscounsels to guide the inexperience of the prince. Se­janus, at that time in a joint commission with hisfather Strabo, had the command of the pranorianbands, and stood high in favour with Tiberius: thearmy would of course consider him as the fountainof rewards and punishments. As soon as they ap­proached the camp, the discontented legions, by wayof doing honour to Drusus, advanced to meet him;not, indeed, with colours displayed, as is usual onsuch occasions; but with a deep and solemn silence,their dress neglected, and their whole appearance un­couth and sordid. In their looks was seen an air ofdejection, and at fhe same time a sullen gloom, thatplainly showed a spirit of mutiny still working intheir heart.
XXV. Drusus was no sooner within the intrench-ments, than the malcontents secured the gates. Sen­tinels were posted at different stations, while the restin a body gathered, round the tribunal. Drusus stoodin act to speak, with his hand commanding silence.The soldiers felt a variety of contending passions:they looked around, and viewing their numbers, grew,fierce at the sight: they rent the air with shouts andwere covered with confusion. An indistinct and hol­low murmur was heard; a general uproar followed;

'Whether in that station, he had made it his business," by arrogance and by a contentious spirit to exas-" perate the prince ; whether he rejoiced at his death;" and, above all, whether he was accessary to it; were" questions that called for a strict but fair inquiry."

and soon afterwards a deep and awful silence. Thebehaviour of the men varied with their passions ; byturns inflamed with rage, or depressed with fear. Dru­sus seized this moment, and read his father's letter,in substance stating, that Tiberius had nothing somuch at heart as the interest of the gallant legionswith whom he had served in so many wars. As soonas his grief for the loss of Augustus allowed him lei­sure, it was his intention to refer the case of the armyto the wisdom of the senate. In the mean time, hesent his son to grant all the relief that could then beapplied. Ulterior demands he reserved for the delibe­ration of the fathers : to enforce authority, or to relaxit, was the lawful right of that assembly; and the se­nate, beyond all doubt, would distribute rewards andpunishments with equal justice.
XXVI. The soldiers made answer, that they hadappointed Julius Clemens to speak in their behalf.That officer claimed a right of dismission from theservice, at the end of sixteen years; all arrears thento be discharged: in the mean time a denarius to hethe soldier's daily pay; and the practice of detainingthe men beyond the period of their service, under thename of veterans, to be abolished forever. In a busi­ness of so much moment, Drusus observed, that thesenate and the emperor must be consulted: a generalclamour followed. " Why did he come so far, since" he had no authority to augment their pay, or to"mitigate their sufferings? The power of doing good" was not confided to him; while every petty officer" inflicted blows, and stripes, and even death. It had" been formerly the policy of Tiberius to elude the" claims of the army, by taking shelter under the name" of Augustus; and now Drusus comes to play the" same farce. How long were they to be amused by" the visits of the emperor's son? Could that be deemed" an equitable government, that kept nothing in sus-" pense but the good of the army? When the soldier" is to be punished, or a battle to be fought, why not"consult the senate? According to the present sys-" tem, reward is to be always a subject of reference," while punishment is instant and without appeal.''

From this time all was uproarand wild commotion. No tribune gave orders, no>prtBfect of the camp was heard. The leaders of themutiny appointed sentinels; they stationed the night,watch, and gave directions as emergencies required.One mind inspired the whole body; and this circum­stance, in the judgment of those who best knew thetemper of the army, was the sure sign of a faction noteasy to be quelled. In separate bodies nothing wasdone; no single incendiary took upon him to direct;together they set up a general shout, and together allwere silent. Every thing moved in concert, and evenanarchy had the appearance of regular discipline.
XXXIII. Meanwhile Germanicus, engaged, as hasbeen mentioned, with the states of Gaul, received ad­vice that Augustus was no more. He had marriedAgrippina, the grand-daughter of that emperor, andby her had several children. Drusus, the brother ofTiberius, was his father, and of course Livia was hisgrand-mother. Thus descended, and thus allied, helived in perpetual anxiety. The sullen aversion ofhis uncle, and the secret malice of Livia, embitteredhis days. The hatred with which they pursued himwas unjust; and, for that reason, unrelenting. Thefact is, Drusus was the delight of the Roman people;they cherished his memory; persuaded that, if thesovereign power had devolved on him, the old repub­lic would have been restored. At his death, the af­fections of mankind were transferred to his son. Fromsimilar virtues the same conduct was expected. Pos­sessed of popular talents, affable and obliging to all,Germanicus presented a strong contrast to the harshtemper and clouded aspect of Tiberius. The jealou­sies that subsisted between the women, added fuel tothe flame; Livia beheld the wife of Germanicus withthe malice of a step-mother; and, in return, Agrip­pina resented every thing with sensibility, perhapswith indignation. But the tenderness of her affection,

vantage; and had well nigh driven the Romans intoa morals, well known to themselves, but impractica­ble to strangers, when Germanicus came up with thelegions in order of battle. At the sight of a regularforce, the Germans were struck with terror. Thebroken ranks of the Romans had time to rally.Nothing decisive followed: Both armies parted uponequal terms: Germanicus marched back to the riverAmisia, and with his legions sailed across the lakes.Part of the cavalry had orders to file along the sea-coast, and by a winding march return to the banksof the Rhine. , ',
Csecina, at the head of his own division, marchedthrough a country of which he was not ignorant. Heljad 'directions to pass the long bridges with all possi­ble expedition. The place so called is a narrow cause­way, constructed formerly by Lucius Domitius. Itstretches a great length of way between two prodi­gious marshes. The country round is one vast fen, insome parts covered with a deep and slimy mud, inothers with a tenacious heavy clay, intersected fre­quently with rapid torrents. A thick forest, rising atsome distance on a gradual acclivity, inclosed thewiiole scene, and formed a kind of amphitheatre. Ar-minius, who knew the course of the country, made aforced march, and took post in the woods before theRomans, encumbered with arms and heavy baggage,arrived at the place. CfEcina found a double difficul­ty.

farinas, had served in the Roman camp among theauxiliary troops. He deserted afterwards, and col­lected together a body of freebooters, accustomed tolive by rapine, and by consequence addicted to a lifeof warfare. Tacfarinas had acquired some rudimentsof military discipline. He formed his, rash leviednumbers into companies of foot and squadrons ofhorse. Having drawn over to his party the Musula-nians, a nation bordering on the wilds of Africa,where they led a roving life, without towns, or fixedhabitations, he was no longer the chief of a band ofrobbers, but with a higher title, the general of a peo­ple. The neighbouring Moors, a race of savages,under the command of Mazippa, jqined the confe­deracy. The two chiefs agreed to divide their troopsinto two separate bodies. Tacfarinas, with the flowerof the army formed a regular camp, arming his menafter the Roman manner, and training them to theart of war; while Mazippa, at the head of his light-armed freebooters, ravaged the country, and markedhis way with fire and sword. The Cinithians, a na­tion by no means contemptible, were forced to enterinto the league.
At length, Furius Camillus, proconsul of Africayadvanced to check the insurgents, at the head of alegion, and such of the allies as still remained underhis command. With this handful of men, a slenderforce when compared to the numbers of the Moorsand Numidians, the Roman general determined tohazard a decisive action. His chief care was, not tostrike the enemy with terror. Their fears, he knew,would make them avoid an action, and protract thewax. The barbarians hoped to gain an easy victory,and by their hopes were led on to their destruction.Camillus drew up in order of battle. His legion form­ed the centre : in the wings were stationed the lightcohorts, and two squadrons of horse. Nor did Tac­farinas decline the conflict. He engaged, and was to­tally routed. By this victory the name of Camillus,after an interval of many years, seemed to retrieve itsancient honours. From him, who was the delivererof Rome, and his son, who emulated the father's exr

XLIV. The soldiers were appeased by this ha­rangue. They acknowledged their guilt, and thejustice of the reproof. In a suppliant tone they en­treated Germanicus to select for punishment the mostobnoxious; to pardon the weakness of men drawninto error, and lead them against the enemy. Theyrequested that his wife might be recalled; and thathis son, the darling of the camp, might not be sent ahostage to the states of Gaul.

anniversary of his accession to the imperial dignity,was the day of his death. He died at Nola, in thesame house, and in the same chamber, where Octaviushis father breathed his last.* They called to mind, inwonder and amaze, the number of his consulships,equal to those of Valerius Corvinus and Caius Mariusput together. The tribunitian power continued in hishands during a series of seven-and-thirty years; hewas saluted Imperator no less than one-and-twentytimes; and other titles of distinction were either in­vented or revived to adorn his name. Reflections ofa different kind were made by thinking men. Theyrejudged the. life of the emperor, and pronounced withfreedom. By his apologists, it was argued, " that" filial piety to his adopted father, the distraction of" the times, and the ruin of the laws, made the part"he took in the civil wars an act of necessity; and" civil war can neither be undertaken or conducted on" principles of honour and strict justice. To revenge" the death of Julius Csesar, was the primary motive." To obtain that end, he made concessions to Antony," and he temporized with Lepidus: but when the lat-" ter grew gray in sloth, and the former fell a victim" to his voluptuous passions, the commonwealth, con-" vulsed by party divisions, had no resource but the" government of one. There was, however, no mo-" narchy, no dictator: content with the unassuming" title of Prince of the Senate, he established peace," and settled the constitution. The ocean and far" distant rivers marked his boundaries of the empire." The legions, the provinces, and the fleets of Rome" acted in concert, with all the strength of system."Justice was duly administered at home; the allies" were treated with moderation; and magnificent" structures rose to ador n the capital. Violent mea-"sures were rarely adopted, and never but for the" good of the whole."

ment, had great weight with the fathers; and whatwas established by that prince, Tiberius would notpresume to alter. To fix the salary of the players ata certain sum, and to repress the zeal of their parti­sans, several decrees were passed: the most materialwere, " That no senator should enter the house of a"pantomime performer: that the Roman knights" should not attend the players in the street; no ex-" hibition to be presented in any place except the" theatre; and all who engaged in riots were liable to" be banished by the sentence of the prsetor."
LXXVIII. In consequence of a petition from Spain,leave was given to erect a temple to Augustus in thecolony of Terragon. By this decree a precedent washeld forth to all the provinces. The people of Romepresented a petition, praying that the payment of thehundredth part, which was a tax on all vendible com­modities, imposed since the close of the civil wars,might be remitted for the future. Tiberius declared,by public edict, " That the support of the army de-" pendod upon that fund; and even with those re-" sources the commonwealth was unequal to the" charge, unless the veterans were retained in the ser-" vice for the full term of twenty years." By this art­ful stroke, the regulations limiting the time to sixteenyears, which had been extorted during the sedition inGermany, were in effect repealed, and rendered voidfor the future.
LXXIX. A project to prevent inundations, by givinga new course to the lakes and rivers that emptythemselves into the Tiber, was proposed to the senateby Lucius Arruntius and Atteius Capito. The mu­nicipal towns and colonies were heard in oppositionto the measure. The Florentines stated, " That if the" Clanis were diverted from its channel, and made to" flow by a new course into the Arno, their whole" country would be ruined." The inhabitants of In-teramna made the like objection; contending that " if" the Nan, according to the plan proposed, were di-.

country, and the wretched condition to which theywere reduced, were all as nothing compared to thisinsulting memorial. Preparing but a little before toabandon their habitations, and seek new settlementsbeyond the Elbe, they changed their minds, and oncemore resolved to try the hazard of a battle. The no­bles and the populace, the old and the young, allranks and classes of men appeared in arms. Theypursued the Romans on their march; they harassedthe rear, and often throw them into disorder. Re­solved at length to risk a battle, they chose for thatpurpose a narrow and swampy plain, inclosed on oneside by a river, and on the other by a thick wood, atthe back of which lay a deep morass. A rampart,formerly thrown up by the Angrivarians, as a bar­rier between themselves and the Cheruscans, inclosedone side of the fen. On this spot the barbarians sta­tioned their infantry. Their cavalry lay in ambushin the woods, with intent, as soon as the Romans ad­vanced, to attack them by surprise, and cut off therear of the army.
XX. Germanicus had intelligence of all that pass­ed. Their stations, their councils of war, their publicdebates, their secret resolutions were all discovered;and their own devices were turned against themselves.The command of the horse was given to Seius Tu-bero, with orders to form on the open plain. The in­fantry was so disposed that by an easy pass one divi­sion might penetrate into the woods, while the othercarried the rampart by assault. Whatever was diffi­cult or arduous the general reserved for himself,leaving all slighter operations to his officers. On thelevel plain the cavalry bore down all before them;but the rampart was not easily taken. The soldierswho advanced to the attack were as much exposed tothe darts of the enemy, as if they had been beforethe, walls of a regular fortification. Germanicus sawthe disadvantage. Ho drew off the legions; and or­dered the engineers and slingers to play upon theworks, in order to drive the barbarians from theirpost.

before the fathers. A licentious spirit of defamationprevailed at Rome, and reigned without control.The vile and profligate launched out with virulenceagainst the best members of society, and the statuesof the Csesars were a sanctuary, where the assassinsof every honest name found protection. The freed-men, and even the slaves, poured out a torrent ofabuse; and, after lifting their hands against their pa­trons or their masters, resorted to the same asylum,where they grew more formidable in their insolence.Caius Cestius, a member of the senate, complainedof this enormity: " Princes," he said, " represented the" gods; but the gods lent a favourable ear to none"but the just. Neither the capitol nor the temples" were places of refuge, where guilt might find a shel-" ter, and even encouragement. In a late prosecution" Annia Rufilla was found guilty of manifest fraud;" and if such a woman might with impunity, in the"forum, and even in the portal of the senate, insult'" him with opprobrious language, 'and even with" menaces; if such contumacy were permitted, and" the emperor's statue gave a sanction to evil prac-" tices, insomuch that he could obtain no redress, all" good order was at an end, and the laws were no"better than a dead letter." Others spoke to thesame effect. Facts still more atrocious were stated,and, with one voice, the whole assembly called onDrusus for exemplary punishment. Rufilla wascited to appear; and, being convicted, the fathers or­dered her to be imprisoned in the common jail.
XXXVII. Confidius jEquus and Cselius Cursor,two Roman knights, who had preferred a false chargeof violated majesty against Magius Csecilianus, thenone of the prsetors, were for that offence condemned,a.t the desire of Tiberius. From this act of justice,as well as the sentence against Rufilla, Drusus de­rived no small share of popularity.

dignity of pontiff and sedile: on the latter, by his birthobscure, but eminent for military talents, and the com­panion of all his victories, he conferred the honour oftwo successive consulships; and in a short time after,upon the untimely death of Marcellus, chose him forhis son-in-law. Tiberius Nero, and Claudius Drusus,the sons of his wife Livia, were adorned with the titleof Imperator, though the succession in the house ofAugustus was at that time well secured by otherbranches of the house of Csesar. He had alreadyadopted into the imperial family Caius and Lucius,the two sons of Agrippa; and to see them, even be­fore they had put on the manly gown, considered asprinces of the Roman youth, and marked out as futureconsuls, was his ardent desire; though, for politicalreasons, he chose to disguise his sentiments. To ob­tain those honours for his family was the wish of hisheart; while, under a show of coy reluctance, he seem­ed to reject them. Agrippa departed this life, and ina short time after his two sons were cut off; LuciusCsesar on his road to join the army in Spain; andCaius on his return from Armenia, where he had re­ceived a wound that impaired his health. Whetherthey died by their own premature fate, or the machi­nations of their step-mother Livia, is to this day pro­blematical. Drusus had paid his debt to nature, leav­ing Tiberius the only surviving son-in-law of the*emperor. The current of court favour was nowdirected that way. He was adopted by Augustus,declared his colleague in the government, his asso­ciate in the tribunitian power, and shown as the risingsun to the army, not, as before, by the secret arts ofLivia, but with her open and avowed direction.Augustus was now in the decline of life, and Liviahad gained unbounded influence over his affections.By her contrivance Agrippa Posthumus, the only sur-iviving grandson of the emperor, was banished to the:isle of Planasia. In praise of this young man muchcannot be said: he was a stranger to the liberal arts,uncouth, unformed, and stupidly valuing himself onhis bodily strength; yet free from vice, or the impu­tation of crime.

XL. The miraculous escape of Agrippa was cur­rently reported all over Italy. At Rome the storywas believed. The impostor landed at Ostia, amidstthe acclamations of the rabble. Clandestine meet­ings were held in the capital. Tiberius was throwninto the utmost perplexity. Should he call forth hissoldiers to subdue a slave? Were it not more ad­visable to leave the rumour to its own futility ? On asudden he was bent on vigorous measures, and no­thing was to be slighted: he wavered, fluctuated, andto act with coolness seemed more advisable; to bealarmed at trifles was unworthy of the prince. Theresolution of one moment gave way to the whim ofthe next, and pride and fear alternately distractedhim. He resolved, and decided nothing. Weary ofhimself, he left the whole to Salluslius Crispius.That minister sent two of his creatures (some say,two soldiers) to join the fictitious Agrippa, as men de­voted to his cause: he gave them full instructions tosupply him with money, and profess thomselves ready• in his'service, to encounter every danger. The menacted their parts; and, in the dead of night, seizingtheir opportunity, fell with a strong party upon theadventurer. Having seized his person, they draggedhim in fetters, with a gag in his mouth, to the impe­rial palace. Being there interrogated by Tiberius," how he came to be Agrippa," he is said to have an­swered, " as you came to be Csesar." With undaunt­ed resolution he refused to discover his accomplices.Tiberius, not choosing to hazard a public execution,ordered him to be put to death in a sequestered partof the palace. The body was privately conveyedaway; and though at the time there was reason tobelieve that many of the emperor's household, andeven several of the Roman knights and senators, as­sisted the impostor with their advice and money, th»affair was dropt without further inquiry.

popularity, insomuch that he was hailed the Fatherof the Legions.
His wife Plancina forgot the decencies of the femalecharacter. She attended the troops in the field, shereviewed'the cavalry; she railed with spleen and ma­lice against Agrippina, and did not even spare Ger-manieus. This behaviour, it was generally believed,had the approbation and countenance of Tiberius.The consequence was, that not only the weak andprofligate were alienated from Germanicus, but eventhe men of sober conduct, who were inclined to re­main in their duty, went in a short time to pay theirhomage to the favourites of the emperor.
LVI. Germanicus was fully apprised of these pro­ceedings ; but Armenia claimed his first attention. Hehastened without loss of time to regulate the affairsof that kingdom, where caprice and levity marked thenational character, and the situation of the countryencouraged the inconstancy of the people. Armeniaborders a great length of way upon the Roman pro­vinces; then stretches, to a vast extent, as far as theterritory of the Medes. Hemmed in by two great em­pires, that of Parthia and of Rome, the Armeniansare never steady to either; but. with their naturallevity, alternately at variance with each; with theRomans, from rooted aversion; with the Parthians,from motives of ambition, and national jealousy. Inthe present juncture, the throne was vacant. Vo-nones being expelled, the wishes of the people werefixed on Zeno, the son of Polemon, king of Pontus.The young prince had shown, from his earliest youth,a decided inclination to Armenian manners. Thesports of the chase were his favourite amusement; hedelighted in carousing festivals, and all the pastimesof savage life. For these qualities he was high inesteem, not only with the populace, but also thegrandees of the nation. In this disposition of men'sminds, Germanicus entered the city of Artaxata, and,amidst the acclamations of the people, placed thediadem on the head of Zeno. The Armenians paidhomage to their new master, in the ardour of theirzeal proclaiming him king, by the name of Artaxias,

sorrow, varied only by the contrast between the at­tendants of Agrippina, and those who now receivedthe first impression. The former appeared with alanguid air; while the latter, yielding to the sensationof the moment, broke out with all the vehemence of ,recent grief.
II. Tiberius had ordered to Brundusium two prse­torian cohorts. The magistrates of Calabria, Apulia,and Campania, had it in command to pay everymark of honour to the memory of the emperor's son.The urn was borne on the shoulders of the centurionsand tribunes, preceded by the colours, not displayedwith military pomp, but drooping in disorder, with allthe negligence of grief. The fasces were inverted. Inthe colonies through which they passed, the populacein mourning, and the knights in their purple robes,threw into the flames rich perfumes, spices and gar­ments, with other funeral offerings, according to theability of the place. Even from distant towns thepeople came in crowds to meet the procession; theypresented victims; they erected altars to the gods ofdeparted souls, and by their lamentations markedtheir sense of the public calamity. Drusus advancedas far as Terracina, accompanied by Claudius, thebrother of Germanicus, and the children of the de­ceased prince that had been left at Rome. The con­suls, Marcus Valerius Messala, and Marcus AureliusCotta, who a little before had entered on their ma­gistracy, with the whole senate, and a numerous bodyof citizens, went out to meet the melancholy train.The road was crowded; no order kept, no regularprocession; they walked, and wept, as inclinationprompted. Flattery had no share in the business:where the court rejoiced in secret, men could notweep themselves into favour. Tiberius indeed dis­sembled, but he could not deceive. Through the thindisguise the malignant heart was seed.
HI. Neither the emperor nor his mother appearedin public. They imagined, perhaps, that to be seenin a state of affliction might derogate front their dig­nity; or, the better reason was, that a number ofprying eyes might unmask their inmost sentiments.

source of dissension. He condemned the conduct ofPiso; and in return met with nothing but contumacy,and a spirit of opposition to all his measures. Pisowas at length determined to evacuate Syria: hearing,however, that Germanicus was attacked by a sud­den illness, he changed his resolution. He had soonafter the mortification of learning that the disorderwas abated. At Antioch the news diffused a generaljoy. The people of that place had offered vows forthe recovery of the prince: and, having obtained theobject of their wishes, began by solemn rites to dis­charge the obligations which they had imposed uponthemselves. Enraged at this proceeding, Piso inter­rupted the ceremonies; by his lictors he drove thevictims from the altars; he spread terror and con­fusion through the temples, and dispersed the con­gregation. After this exploit he withdrew to Seleu-cia. At that place, having advice that Germanicuswas relapsed, he resolved to make some stay, in ex­pectation of the event. The prince suspected thatpoison had been secretly conveyed by Piso, and thatidea added to the malignity of his disorder.
A discovery was made of a singular nature. Un­der the floor, and in the cavities of the walls, a col­lection of human bones was found, with charms, andmagic verses, and incantations. The name of Ger­manicus was graved on plates of lead; fragments ofhuman bodies, not quite consumed to ashes, werediscovered in a putrid condition; with a variety ofthose magic spells, which, according to the vulgaropinion, are of potency to devote the souls of theliving to the infernal gods. Amidst the confusion oc­casioned by these extraordinary circumstances, mes­sengers were sent by Piso to inquire after the healthof Germanicus; but those men were considered asspies, who came to watch for intelligence.
LXX. Germanicus was informed of all that passed.Fear and indignation took possession of him by turns." If my doors," he said, " are to be besieged by my" enemies; if interlopers are to see me at the pomt of4' expiration, what is the prospect that my wife has" before her ? and what are my children to expect?

It was there that Apollo, afterhaving slain the Cyclops, found a retreat from thevengeance of Jupiter; it was there that Bacchus, af­ter his victories, gave a free pardon to such of theAmazons as fled for protection to the altar; and itwas there that Hercules, having conquered Lydia,established a temple, with rites and ceremonies, whichneither the Persian kings, nor the Macedonian con­queror, presumed to violate. The Romans at all timespaid the strictest regard to the sanctity of the place.

In the wars which were waged under theirconduct, the Magnesians adhered with fidelity to thecause of Home; and to reward their services, thetemple of Diana Leucophryne was, by those com­manders, declared a sanctuary. The people of Aphro-disium, and also of Stratonice, produced a decree ofCsesar the dictator, and another of Augustus, com­memorating the zeal, with which those states with­stood the Parthian invasion, and preserved to the lasttheir attachment to the interest of Rome. The Aphro-disians claimed the temple of Venus; the Stratoni-ceans worshipped Jupiter and Diana Trivia. Thecity of Hierocsesarea deduced their ceremonies fromremote antiquity, alleging that they had for agesadored a Persian Diana, in a temple consecrated byCyrus. Several orders made by Pcrpenna, byIsauricus, and other Roman generals, were also cited,whereby it appeared that those sanctuaries, with aprecinct two miles round, were declared holy ground.The inhabitants of Cyprus claimed three sanctuaries;the first and most ancient, dedicated by Aerias to thePaphian Venus; the second, by Amathus, the son ofAerias, in honour of the Amathusian Venus; and tlisthird, to the Salaminian Jove, by Teucer, the son ofTelamon, when that hero was obliged to fly from th«rcge of his father

row limits. What topic could be safely handled?The emperor was the enemy of civil liberty, and hedetested flattery.
LXXXVUI. In the memoirs of some of the senatorsof that day, and also in the works of contemporarywriters, mention, 1 find, is made of letters from Ad-gandestrius, prince of the Cattians, which were readin the senate. They contained a proposal to despatchArminius, provided poison for that purpose were sentfrom Rome. The answer was magnanimous: theGerman was told that the Roman people were in thehabit of waging war, not by fraud and covert strata­gem, but sword in hand, and in the field of battle. Inthis instance, Tiberius vied with the generals of an­cient Rome, who with scorn rejected the scheme ofpoisoning Pyrrhus, and even delivered up the traitorwho harboured that base design.
Arminius, however, did not long survive. The Ro­man army being withdrawn from Germany, and Ma-roboduus ruined, he had the ambition to aim at *hesovereign power. The independent spirit of hiscountrymen declared against him. A civil war en­sued. Arminius fought with alternate vicissitudes offortune, and fell at last by the treachery of his ownrelations: a man of warlike genius, and, beyond allquestion, the deliverer of Germany. He had not, likethe kings and generals of a former day, the infancyof Rome to cope with; he had to struggle with agreat and flourishing empire; he attacked the Ro­mans in the meridian of their glory. He stood at bayfor a number of years with equivocal success; some­times victorious, often defeated, but in the issue of thewar still unconquered. He died at the age of seven-and-thirty, after twelve years of fame and power. In'the rude poetry of the barbarians, his name is cele­brated to this hour; unknown indeed to the annalistsof Greece, who embellish nothing but their own story.Even amongst the Romans, the character of this illus­trious chief has met with little justice, absorbed asthe people are in their veneration of antiquity, whileto the virtue of their own times they remain insensi­ble and incurious.

" peased. To return to Syria, were to enter into a" civil war with Sentius. The centurions and soldiers" were not to be trusted. The memory of Germani-" cus was still recent: and that affection for the" Csesarian family, which had taken root in the minds" of all, would operate throughout the army."
LXXVII. Domitius Celer, the intimate friend ofPiso, was of a contrary opinion. " The opportunity,"he said, " should be seized without delay. Piso, and"not Sentius, was the legal governor of Syria: the" prsetorian jurisdiction, the ensigns of magistracy," and the command of the legions, were committed" to his care. If the sword must be drawn, who had" so much right on his side as the person who receiv-" ed his commission from the emperor? Public ru-" mour should not be too soon encountered. Give" the report of the day time to ,grow stale, and it dies" of itself. In the first heat of prejudice, innocence" itself has often fallen a victim to popular clamour." If Piso, at the head of an army, stood at bay with" his enemies, new emergencies, which no wisdom ," could foresee, might unexpectedly assist his cause." Why should he hasten to the capital? Was it his" interest to enter Rome with Agrippina bearing the" urn of Germanicus? Did he mean, unheard and" undefended, to try the effect of female lamentation," or to be hurried to execution by the fury of a licen-" tious rabble ? Livia, it is true, is of your party, and" Tiberius will favour you; but both will act in se-" cret: and, in fact, none will grieve for Germanicus" with so much ostentation of sorrow, as they who," in their hearts rejoice at the event."
LXXVIII. The turbulent genius of Piso was easilysatisfied with this reasoning. He despatched lettersto Tiberius, charging Germanicus with pride andluxury; and farther complaining, that, with viewsof ambition, he had driven out of Syria the lawfulgovernor, duly appointed by the emperor. That go­vernor, he added, would now resume the command;and, by a faithful discharge of so important a trust,demonstrate his zeal for the public service. Thus de­termined, he ordered Domitius to sail for Syria; keep­

in a litter, guarded by a tribune of the prsetoriajibands: but whether that officer was sent to protecthim from the populace, or to see justice executed, wasleft to conjecture and vague reports.
XV. Plancina, no less than her husband, was anobject of public detestation; but protected by courtfavour, she was thought to be out of the reach of herenemies. What Tiberius would do was uncertain.While she supposed herself involved in the fate ofPiso, without a gleam of better hope, her languagewas that of a woman willing to share all chances withher husband, and, if he was doomed to fall, deter­mined to perish with him. Having in the mean time,by the interest of Livia, obtained her pardon, she be­gan to change her tone, and pursue a separate interest.Finding himself thus abandoned, Piso despaired of hiscause. Without further struggle, he intended to re­sign himself to his fate; but, by the advice of hissons, he resumed his courage, and once more appear­ed before the senate. The prosecution was renewedwith vigour; the fathers spoke in terms of acrimony;every thing was adverse; and the prisoner plainly sawthat his fate was decided. In this distress nothing af­fected him so deeply as the behaviour of Tiberius, whosat in sullen silence, neither proVoked to anger, norsoftened by compassion, with his usual art stiflingevery emotion of the heart. Piso was conducted backto his house. He there wrote a few lines, in appear­ance preparing his defence for the ensuing day, andhaving sealed the paper, delivered it to one of hisfreedmen. The usual attentions to his person filledup his time, till, at a late hour of the night, his wifehaving left the room, he ordered the door to be madefast. In the morning he was found dead; his throatcut, and his sword lying near him on the ground.
XVI. I remember to have heard from men advancedin years, that a bundle of papers, not produced at thetrial, was often seen in the hands of Piso, containing,as his friends attested, the letters of Tiberius, full ofinstructions hostile to Germanicus. These docu­ments would have transferred the guilt to the empe­ror; but by the delusive promises of Sejanus, they

•4 and his wife Planeina were known to have assisted44 in superstitious rites and impious sacrifices. And"yet the prisoner did not stop there: he was guilty" of rebellion; he appeared in arms against the state;" and before he could be brought to justice as a citi-" zen, he was conquered as an enemy."
XIV. The defence in every article, except thatwhich related to the crime of poison, was weak andineffectual. The charge of debauching the soldiersby bribery, the rapacity of his creatures, and the in-suits offered to Germanicus, were stubborn facts, andcould not be denied. The crime of poisoning seemedto be sufficiently answered. It was left on weakground by the managers of the prosecution. All theyhad to urge in support of that article, was a bare al­legation, that Piso, at an entertainment given by Ger­manicus, being placed on a couch above the prince,had contrived with his own hands to mingle poison*with the victuals. An attempt of the kind, in themidst of servants not his own, under the eye of num­bers, and in the very presence of Germanicus, seemedimprobable, and indeed absurd. To refute it altoge­ther, Piso made a tender of his slaves to be ques­tioned on the rack, demanding, at the same time, thatthe domestics of Germanicus, who waited that day attabic, should undergo the like examination. But no­thing made an impression on the judges. For differ­ent reasons they were all implacable; Tiberius, onaccount of the war levied in Syria: the senators, froma full persuasion that treachery had a hand in thedeath of Germanicus. A motion was made for theproduction of all letters written to the criminal byTiberius and Livia. This was opposed with vehe­mence, not only by Piso, but also by the emperor. Theclamours of the populace, who surrounded the senate-house, were heard within doors. The cry was, if Pisoescaped by the judgment of the fathers, he should dieby the hands of the people. They had already seizedhis statues, and in their fury, dragged them to the placeof execution called the Gemonise, with intent to breakthem into fragments. By order of Tiberius they wererescued out of their hands. Piso was conveyed home

Celendris. With a body of deserters, incorporatedwith the recruits lately intercepted, and the auxiliariessent by the kings of Cilicia, he threw himself into theplace, resolved to hold out to the last. To his forceshe added his own slaves, and those of Plancina, form­ing altogether a number equal to a legion. To excitetheir courage, he complained aloud that he, the go­vernor appointed by Tiberius, was driven out of theprovince, not by the legions (for they invited him toreturn) but by Sentius, who, with the specious colourof public motives, varnished over his own private ani­mosity. He told his troops, that they had only toshow themselves in force, and the aflFair would be de­cided. The soldiers of the adverse party, at the sightof Piso, whom they hailed the father of the legions,would lay down their arms and submit to the manwho not only had justice on his side, but if necessary,courage and resolution to maintain his rights. Hav­ing thus exhorted his people, he drew them out be­fore the walls of the castle, on the summit of a craggyhill. The place was every where else surrounded bythe sea. The veterans, under Sentius, advanced inregular order. A body of reserve followed to supportthem. On one side were seen skill and bravery: onthe other, nothing but the advantage of the ground;no courage to incite; no hope to animate; and nowarlike weapons, but only such rustic tools as themen were able to snatch up in the first tumult of adangerous enterprise. An engagement followed; butthe victory was no longer in suspense, than while theRomans were employed in forcing their way up theascent of the hill. The steep being surmounted, theCicilians fled for shelter to their fortifications.

Beingrepulsed, he showed himself before the works of thecastle; he complained of cruel injustice, and tried bythe force of pathetic language to soften the legions inhis favour; he called upon individuals by name, andby ample promises hoped to raise a spirit of sedition.His success was such, that an eagle-bearer of the

In that con-" dition we are still condemned to the toils of war." Even the men who have obtained their discharge," still follow the standard under the name of veterans:" another word for protracted misery. A few, indeed," by their bodily vigour have surmounted all their"labours; but what is their reward? They are sent" to distant regions; and, under colour of an allot-" ment of lands, they are settled on a barren moun-" tain, or a swampy fen. War of itself is a state of" the vilest drudgery, without an adequate compen­sation. The life and limb of a soldier are valued at" ten pence a day : out of that wretched pittance he" must find his clothing, his tent equipage, and his" arms; with that fund, he must bribe the centurion:"with that, must purchase occasional exemptionsMjrom service; and, with that, must pay for a remis-" sion of punishment.

monstrated that " if the communication, by which the" lake Velinus fell into the Nar, were obstructed, the." adjacent country would be laid under water. Na-" ture had wisely provided for the interests of man;" it was she that assigned to rivers their fountain-" head, their proper channel, and their influx into the" sea. Besides this, the religion of the allies of Rome" claimed respect. Considering the rivers of their"country as under the patronage of tutelary gods,"they had in various places established forms of"worship, and dedicated their priests, their altars," and their sacred groves. The Tiber too, deprived of" his tributary waters, would be reduced, not without"indignation, to an inglorious stream." Convinced bythis reasoning, or deterred by the difficulty of theundertaking, perhaps influenced by superstitious mo­tives, the senate went over to the opinion of Piso,who declared against all innovation.

For this conduct different reasons havebeen assigned. By some we are told that he hatedthe pain of thinking; and, to a void further solicitude,the choice which he once made, was decided for life.Others will have it, that the malignity of his naturewas the secret motive of a man, who did not wish tosee too many made happy by his favours. The pro­blem was solved by others in a different way. Hisdiscernment, they observe, was quick and penetrating;but his judgment slow and anxious. He thought withsubtlety, amd refined till he embarrassed himself; andthough he never was the patron of virtue, he de­tested vice. Superior merit made him tremble for

XLIII. This state of affairs, and the commotions inArmenia, which have been already mentioned, Tibe­rius laid before the senate. His conclusion was, thatto settle the troubles of the east, recourse must be hadto the wisdom of Germanicus. As to himself, he wasnow in the vale of years, and Dnisus had neither ma­turity of age nor experience. The provinces beyondthe Mediterranean were, by a decree of the senate,committed to Germanicus. He was made commander^in chief, with supreme authority, wherever he went,over all other governors, whether appointed by lot,or the will of the prince. At that time Creticus Silanuswas the governor of Syria. Ho had promised hisdaughter in marriage to Nero, the eldest son of Ger­manicus. For that reason Tiberius recalled him fromthe province, and in his place appointed Cneius Piso,a man of violent passions, impatient of control, andfierce with all the spirit of his father, that famous re­publican, who in the civil wars took up arms, againstJulius Csesar, and rekindled the flame in Africa.After that exploit he followed the fortunes of Bru­tus and Cassius. Being at length restored to hiicountry, he disdained all public offices, till Augustusprevailed upon him to accept of the consulship. Tothe pride derived from such a father, the son unitedthe insolence of wealth, acquired by his marriage withPlancina, who, besides her high descent, possessedimmoderate riches. Proud of that connexion, Pisothought himself scarcely second to Tiberius. Theemperor's sons were beneath his rank. The govern­ment of Syria, he made no'doubt, was given to him,as a bar to the hopes of Germanicus. For this pur­pose secret instructions were at the time said to havebeen given to him by Tiberius. Plancina, it is certain,had her lesson from Livia, with full instruction, tomortify the pride of Agrippina with all the arts of fe­male emulation.
The court of Tiberius, divided between Drusus andGermanicus, was a scene of domestic faction. Theemperor, as was natural, gave the preference to hisown immediate issue; but the preference had no othereffect than that of attaching the friends of Germani­

of antiquity would be sufficient honour. The eques­trian order came to a resolution, that the troop calledthe youthful squadron should for the future take itsname from Germanicus; and that his image shouldbe carried at the head of their annual cavalcade, onthe ides of July. Of these several institutions, manyare still subsisting; some fell into disuse; and othersby length of time have been abolished.
LXXXIV. While the tears of the public,still flowedfor Germanicus, Livia, the sister of that prince, andthe wife of Drusus, was delivered of two sons at abirth. In families of inferior rank, events of this kindare rare, and always matter of joy. Tiberius wastransported beyond measure. He had the vanity toboast before the senate, that so singular a blessing hadnever happened to any Roman of equal dignity. Itwas the policy of that subtle spirit to extract fromevery occurrence, and even from chance, somethingthat tended to his own glory. The people, however,did not sympathize with the emperor. They saw,with regret, the family of Drusus increasing, and thatof Germanicus in danger of being eclipsed.
IjXXXV. In the course of this year, several decreesagainst the licentiousness of female manners passedthe senate. It was ordained by a law, that no womanwhose grandfather, father or husband was a Romanknight, should be allowed to make her person venal.The profligacy of Vistilia, descended from a father ofpraetorian rank, gave rise to this regulation. She pre­sented herself before the sediles, and in form made apublic profession of lewdness, according to> the ruleestablished in ancient times, when women, registeredas harlots by the magistrate, had the privilege of lead­ing a life of debauchery. The principle of that lawwas, that the very act of professing the character ofa prostitute would be a punishment, and perhapsoperate as a restraint. Titideus Labeo, the husbandof Vistilia, was cited to assign a reason why so aban­doned a woman had not been brought to condignpunishment. To exculpate himself, he alleged thatthe sixty days, allowed by law for the consultationsnecessary in matters of that nature, were not elapsed.

L. Manius Lepidus opposed the motion. He spokeas follows: " If in our deliberations, conscript fathers," we advert to nothing but the flagitious sentiments," by which Lutorius has discovered the malignity of" his heart, and wounded the ear of others, neither" the dungeon, nor the rope, nor the torments, which" the law ordains for slaves, would be adequate to"the enormity of his guilt. But on the other hand," however great the depravity of mankind, there are" degrees of punishment. The clemency of the" prince interposes often to mitigate the rigour of the"law; the wisdom of our ancestors has delivered" down to us a system of justice founded in mercy," and you have, on many occasions, followed their" example. If between error in judgment and malig-" nity of heart a distinction is to be made, if words" and criminal actions are not to be confounded, the" case before us admits a sentence, which at once will"reach the offence, and leave us no reason to blush"either for our moderation or our severity. The"complaints of the emperor when the guilty, by a" voluntary death, have prevented the effect of his" clemency, have been heard by us all. Lutorius"lives; and should he continue to do so, will the" state be in danger? His death will neither pro-" mote the public interest, nor serve as an example to" others. Productions such as his, the effusions of a" wild and irregular fancy, may well be left to flutter" for a time, and then, like all frivolous things, to be" forgotten. Nothing serious or important is to be ex-" pected from him, who betrays himself, not in the" hearing of men, but in a circle of women. And my" voice is against him: let him be condemned to ex-" ile: let his effects be confiscated; let fire and water" be interdicted. This is my opinion, the same as I" should give, had he been in due form convicted on" the law of violated majesty."

continual war against the characters and fortunes ofthe most eminent citizens, was what he wished toavoid. After mature deliberation, he sent his thoughtsin writing to the senate, in substance as follows:
LIU. " Upon any other question, conscript fathers," it would perhaps be expedient that I should attend" the debate in person, and, in my place, lay before" you /what I conceivo to be for the advantage of the" commonwealth. At present, it may be better that" my eyes should not survey the scene. In so mixed" an assembly, many no doubt, by their looks and" manner, might he apt to betray a consciousness of" their own vicious habits. The attention of the se-" nate would naturally fix upon such men, and I44 should, of course, be led to watch their behaviour:44 in that case, the guilty would, as it were, be taken" in the fact. Had the sediles, whose zeal deserves" commendation, applied in the first instance to me,"1 should, perhaps, have thought it advisable to con-" nive at vices that have gathered strength from time," rather than expose to the world the inveteracy of" the mischief, and the feebleness of legal remedies."

The civility of the prince, he said, was shown, notto the men of Athens (a race long since extirpated,)but to a vile heterogeneous mass, the scum of variousnations, at one time in league with Mithridates againstSylla, and afterwards with Marc Antony against Au­gustus. Ho went back to the times of Philip of Mace-don ; condemning, in terms of reproach, not onlytheir feeble exertions in their struggle with that mo­narch, but also the ingratitude of a giddy populace totheir best and ablest citizens. To this behaviour Pisowas instigated by a private pique against the Athe­nians. It happened that one Theophilus was con­demned for forgery by the judgment of the Areopa­gus: Piso endeavoured to gain a pardon for this man,but that upright judicature was inflexible.
After this prelude to the scenes which he was stillto act, Piso embarked, and after a quick passagethrough the Cyclades, arrived at Rhodes. While helay at the mouth of the harbour, a storm arose, anddrove the vessel on the point of a rock. Germanicuswas then at Rhodes. He knew the hostilities thathad been already commenced against himself, andmight have left a man of that dangerous character tothe mercy of the winds and waves; but, acting withhis usual benevolence, he sent off boats and galleys tosave even an enemy from destruction. Gratitude wasnot in the character of Piso. He spent but a singleday with his benefactor; and to take his measures be­forehand, proceeded on his way to Syria. Havingreached that place, he began by bribery, by intrigueand cabals, to draw to himself the affections of the le­gions. He caressed the lowest of the soldiers: he dis­missed the centurions of approved experience, andremoved all the tribunes, who supported military disci­pline , substituting in their room his own dependants,and still worse, the vile and profligate, who had no­thing but their crimes to recommend them. Slothprevailed in the camp; licentiousness diffused itselfthrough the cities; and over the face of the countrynothing was seen but a dissipated and disorderlyband of soldiers.

low. At the distance of twelve miles from Augusto-dunum, Sacrovir appeared in' force. His line ofbattle was formed on the open plain. The gladiators,in complete armour, were stationed in the centre; hiscohorts in the two wings, and his half-armed multi­tude in the rear. He was himself mounted on a su­perb horse, attended by a number of chiefs. He rodethrough the ranks, haranguing his men: he called tomind the glory of their ancestors, their brave exploitsagainst the Romans, and the eternal honour of suc­ceeding in the cause of liberty. A defeat, he said,would bring with it infamy, and chains, and bondage.
XLVI. The speech was short, and the soldiersheard it without emotion. The legions advanced inregular order. A band of raw recruits, lately leviedin the towns of Gaul, could not sustain a sight soterrible. The faculties of eyes and ears were lost inconfusion. By the Romans victory was already an­ticipated. To exhort them was unnecessary, yet Si-lius thought proper to inflame their ardour. " The" disgrace," he said, " would be great, if the victo-" rious legions, who had conquered in Germany," were now to consider the Gauls as an equal enemy." The rebels of Tours have been chastised by a single"cohort; a detachment of the cavalry crushed the" insurgents at Treves; and a handful of this very" army gave the Sequanians a total overthrow. The" jEduans are now before you; not an army, but an" effeminate race, abounding in wealth, and enervated" by luxury. Charge with valour, and to pursue the" runaways will be your only trouble." This speechwas received with a general shout. The rebels weresoon hemmed in by the cavalry: the front of theirline gave way at the first onset of the infantry, andthe wings were put to flight. The men in iron ar­mour still kept their ranks. No impression could bemade by swords and javelins. The Romans had re­course to their hatchets and pickaxes. With these,as if battering a wall, they fell upon the enormousload and crushed both men and armour. Some at­tacked with clubs and pitchforks.

of the accusers; but in a style of moderation, neitheraggravating nor extenuating the offence.
XXX. Fonteius Agrippa and Caius Vibius, twonew accusers, joined in support of the prosecution.Being now four in number, they could not agreeamong themselves which should take the lead. Thepoint was contested with much warmth. Vibius atlength observed, that Libo came to the trial withoutan advocate to support him; and therefore, to endthe dispute with his associates, he undertook to detailin a plain and simple manner the heads of the charge.Nothing could be more wild and extravagant thansome of the articles. He stated that Libo had madeit a question to the fortune-tellers, whether he shouldever be rich enough to cover with money the Appianroad, as far as Brundusium. There Were other alle­gations of the same stamp, equally void of commonsense; or, to speak more truly, so weak and frivolous,that they could move no passion but pity.
There was, however, one fact of a serious nature.A paper was produced, containing a list of the Csesars,and also sev eral senators, with remarks, or notes, whichno man could decypher, annexed to their names.This was exhibited as the hand-writing of Libo. Heinsisted on his innocence. It was proposed to put hisslaves to the torture. Their evidence, by the estab­lished rules of law, was inadmissible. By an ancient „decree of the senate, it was ordained, that, where themaster's life was in danger, no slave should undergo. the question. Tiberius, by a master-stroke of inven­tion, found an expedient to evade the law. He di­rected a sale of the slaves to be made to the publicofficer, that, the property being altered, they mightthen be examined on a new principle, unknown toformer times. Libo prayed an adjournment to thenext day. , Being returned to his own house, he sentby his relation, Publius Quirinius, an humble petitionto the emperor; the answer was, "he must address»' the senate."

ther. He promised to attend the hearing of the cause,in favour of Urgulania; and that mark of filial com­pliance he thought would not be considered as astretch of power.
He set out accordingly from the palace, his guardsfollowing at a distance. He proceeded slowly throughthe streets, amidst a concourse of people, with an airof calm composure, occasionally loitering in conver­sation. Piso's friends tried all in their power to makehim desist from his suit; but nothing could shake thatresolute temper. To end the controversy, Liviathought good to pay the whole of his demand. Pisoby his firmness did honour to his character, and Ti­berius, gained the popular applause. Urgulania con­tinued, notwithstanding, to tower above the conditionof a citizen; insomuch that, being summoned as awitness in a matter depending before the senate, herpride would not suffer her to appear. A prsetor wassent to take her examination in private; though, byancient usage, the attendance of the vestal virgins,whenever cited to give their testimony, was neverdispensed with, either in the forum or the tribunalsof justice.
XXXV. Part of this year was remarkable for a to­tal suspension of all public business. Of this inactivestate it would be scarce worth while to take noticeif the different sentiments of Cneius Piso and AsiniusGallus did not seem to merit attention. Tiberius gavenotice, that he intended to absent himself for sometime from Rome. Piso declared his opinion, that, insuch a juncture, the senate ought to attend withgreater assiduity to the despatch of business. The fa­thers and the Roman knights might still dischargetheir respective functions; " the dignity of the coin-" monwealth required it." Asinius Gallus saw with ajealous eye, that his rival had taken the popular side;and, to counteract his design, rose to oppose the mo­tion. " Nothing," he said, " could be truly great, or" worthy of the Roman people, unless conducted un-" der the eye of the prince. The affairs of state, and" the great conflux of people, not only from all parts" of Italy, but from the provinces, ought to be reserved

life, the graces of his person, the manner of his death,and the small distance between the places where both 'expired, gave room for the comparison. Both, it wasobserved, were of a comely form; both of illustriousbirth; neither of them much exceeding the thirtiethyear of his age; and both died in a foreign land, cutoff by domestic treachery. But Germanicus hadqualities peculiar to himself: he was mild and gra­cious to his friends, in his pleasures temperate, anaffectionate husband, and by one wife the father of anumerous issue. Nor was his military character anyway inferior: he had the bravery of Alexander, with­out his rashness; and, if he had not been recalled fromGermany, where he gained so many signal victories,the entire conquest of that country had crowned hisoperations with immortal glory. The power of thestate was never in his hands. Had he possessed thesole authority, with the royal title, and the preroga­tive of a prince, the progress of his arms would havemade him equal to the conqueror of Darius; while,,on the side of virtue, his clemency, his moderation,his temperance, and other amiable qualities, gave hima decided superiority. The body lay in state in theforum at Antioch, where the funeral ceremony was' performed. Whether any symptoms of poison werediscovered, is uncertain. The people were dividedinto opposite parties, and their opinions varied ac­cordingly. Some lamented a deceased prince, and, inminds so prepossessed, suspicion amounted to proof;others warped into the interests of Piso; and all pro­nounced according to the bias of their inclinations.
LXXIV. In this juncture, who was the fit personto govern the province', became the subject of debate.A council for this purpose was held by the comman­ders of the legions, and all of senatorian rank, thenon the spot. A number of candidates appeared. Af­ter a short struggle, the contest lay between VibiusMarsus and Cneius Sentius. The question hung forsome time in suspense. Marsus at length withdrewhis pretensions; willing to yield to a senior officer,who showed himself ambitious of the honour. Thefirst step of the new governor was to send to Rome a

" When a crime is committed, the law takes cogni-" sanco of it, and inflicts the punishment. But a law" to prevent the offence, would be at once an act of" mercy to bad men, and a blessing to the provinces."
LXIX. Tiberius spoke in reply : " To the reports,"he said, " which were current to the disadvantage of" Silanus, he was no stranger. But laws ought to" have a better foundation than public rumour. TheV governors of provinces had often disappointed the" hopes, and sometimes the fears of mankind. By" important scenes of action the powers of the mind" are roused; the heart expands to meet the occasion;" while, on the other hand, feeble spirits shrink from" a great opportunity, and grow less by elevation." The prince can never be fully informed; and it is" not fit that he should see with the eyes of others." The arts of ambitious rivals may deceive him. In* human affairs nothing can be foreseen with certain-" ty, and without facts, laws can have no operation." Till men have acted, they cannot be judged. It" was the wisdom of our ancestors to keep the sword" of justice in the scabbard, till actual offences drew" it forth. In a system so just in itself, and so long" established, innovations ought not to be rashly made." The cares of government are a burden to the sove-" reign, and his prerogative wants no enlargement." Extend his authority, and you abridge the rights of"the subj«ct. When the laws in being are suffi-" cient, there is no occasion to resort to the will of the" prince."
This was, no doubt, a constitutional speech. Fronva man little studious of popularity, it was receivedwith universal approbation. Tiberius did not stop:'here; whon his own private resentment was not pro­voked, ho knew that moderation was the best policy:with that view he thought proper to add, that Gya-rus was a dreary island, uncultivated, and inhospita­ble. In honour, therefore, of the Julian family, andfrom motives of lenity to a man who was a memberof the senate, he proposed to change the place of ba­nishment to the isle of Cythera: and this, he said,was the request of Torquata, sister to Silanus, and a

1 e, by which it was enacted, that no sentence of.' pronation should, for the future, be sent to thel. ary, till the tenth day after passing it; and in theinterval, execution was to be suspended. The fathers,however, were not to have the power of rejudgingtheir own acts, or revoking their sentence. The ap­peal was to be to Tiberius, and no time could softenthat implacable temper.
LII. Caius Sulpicius and Decimus Heterius werethe next consuls. The year was free from foreigncommotions; but at Rome new laws were expected tocheck the growth of luxury, and that apprehensionspread a general alarm. The prodigality of the timeshad risen to the highest pitch. In many articles ofexpense, and those the heaviest, the real price mightbe concealed i but the cost of the table was too wellunderstood. The profusion, with which luxury wasmaintained, could not remain a secret. It was there­fore apprehended, that a prince, addicted to the fru­gality of ancient manners, would endeavour by severei emulations to control the mischief.
The subject was opened in the senate by Caius Bi-bulus, one of the sediles: his colleague joined to sup­port him. They stated that the sumptuary lawswere fallen into contempt. The extravagance in fur­niture and utensils, though prohibited, grew everyday more enormous, insomuch that, by modern pe­nalties, the mischief was not to be cured. The se­nate, without further debate, referred the whole tothe consideration of the emperor. Tiberius weighedevery circumstance: he knew that passions, whichhad taken root could not be easily weeded out of theheart: he considered how far coercive measures mightbe a public grievance. If an unsuccessful attemptgave a victory to vice, the defeat he saw would be adisgrace to government; and tho necessity of waging,

LII. An account of these events arriving at Rome,Tiberius was variously affected. He received a degree |of pleasure, but it was a pleasure mingled with anxie­ty. That the troubles in the camp were at an end,he heard with satisfaction: but he saw, with a jealousspirit, that by largesses, and dismissions from the ser­vice, Germanicus had gained the affections of the le­gions. The glory of his arms was another circum­stance that touched him nearly. He though fit, not­withstanding, to lay the whole account before the se­nate. He expatiated at large in praise of Germani­cus, but in terms of studied ostentation, too elaborateto be thought sincere. Of Drusus, and the issue ofthe troubles in Illyricum, he spoke with more reserve;concise, yet not without energy. The concessionsmade by Germanicus to the legions on the Rhine,were ratifir d in every article, and at the same timeextended to the army in Pannonia.
L1II. In the course of the year died Julia, thedaughter of Augustus. On account of her lasciviouspleasures, she had been formerly banished by herfather to the Isle of Pandataria, and afterward toRhegium, a city on the streights of Sicily. Duringthe life of her sons Caius and Lucius, she became thewife of Tiberius, and by the haughtiness of her car­riage made him feel that she thought him beneath herrank. The arrogance of her behaviour was the secretand most powerful motive for the retreat, which thatprince made to the Isle of Rhodes. At his accessionto the empire, when he was master of the Romanworld, he saw her in a state of destitution, banished,covered with infamy, and, after the murder of AgrippaPosthumus, without a ray of hope to comfort her.Yet this could not appease the malice of Tiberius.He ordered her to be starved to death; concludingthat, after a tedious exile at a place remote, a linger­ing death in want and misery, would pass unnoticed.
From the same root of bitterness sprung the cruel­ly with which he persecuted Semprpnius Gracchus;a man descended from a noble family, possessed oftalents, and adorned with eloquence, but eloquence vi­ciously applied. By his wit and rare accomplishments

•ndrwas Ateius Capito, already mentioned; a man,or his abilities and his knowledge of the laws, of the
st eminence in the state. From his birth he de-,"ed no advantage. His grand-father was a centurioni,der Sylla: his father rose to the rank of prator.uapito was, with rapid speed, advanced by Augustus
0 the consular dignity, and, by that promotion,iaced above his competitor, Antistius Labeo, who

, '.'est foundation; he was a strenuous asserter of civil
: :,erty, and for that reason the favourite of the peo-, 'e. Capito knew his approaches to the great, and
his flexibility became a favourite at the courtof Augustus. Labeo was not suffered to rise:iliive *he prsetorian rank; but that act of injus­tice raised his popularity: while, on the other hand,Capito obtained the consulship, and with it the pub-li , hatred.

heard before himself. The request was perfectlyagreeable to the accused party, who was not to learnthat the senate and the people were prejudiced againsthim. "Tiberius, ho knew, was firm enough to resistpopular clamour ; and in conjunction with Livia, hadacted an underhand part in the business. Besidesthis, the truth, he thought, would be better investi­gated before a single judge, than in a mixed assembly,where intrigue and party violence too often prevailed.Tiberius, however, saw the importance of the cause,and felt the imputations thrown out against himself.To avoid a situation so nice and difficult, he consentedto hear, in the presence of a few select friends, theheads of the charge, with the answers of the defend­ant; and then referred the whole to the considerationof the senate.
XI. During these transactions, Drusus returnedfrom Illyricum. For the captivity of Maroboduus,and the prosperous events of the preceding summeran ovation had been decreed by the senate; but hechose to postpone that honour, and entered the cityas a private man. Piso moved that Titus Arruntius, .T. Vinicius, Asinius Gallus, ^serninus Marcellus,and Sextus Pompeius, might be assigned as advocatesto defend his cause. Under different pretexts theyall excused themselves; and in their room, MarcusLepidus, Lucius Piso, and Livineius Regulus, wereappointed. The whole city was big with expectation.It remained to be seen how far the friends of Ger-manicus would act with firmness; what resourcesPiso had left, and whether Tiberius would speak hismind, or continue as usual, dark and impenetrable.No juncture had ever occurred in which the peoplewere so warmly interested; none, when in privatediscourse men made such bitter reflections, and none,when suspicion harboured such gloomy apprehen­sions.

and carry desolation into the provinces of Gaul. TheGermans, at the same time, knew the dissensions ofthe Roman army; and, if the Rhine were once aban*.doned, stood in readiness to seize so advantageous apost. The moment was full of perplexity. To employthe auxiliary forces and the states in alliance withRome against the revolted legions, were to engagein a civil war. To proceed with rigour might be dan­gerous ; and to pacify the men with largesses, werean expedient altogether dishonourable. Grant all ornothing, the dilemma was either way big with mis­chief. After mature deliberation, letters were framedin the name of Tiberius, importing, that at the end oftwenty years the soldier should be entitled to his dis­mission ; that, after sixteen, he should be deemed aveteran, still retained in the service, but exempt fromall duty, except that of repelling the incursions of theenemy. A promise was added, that the legacies givenby Augustus should not only be paid, but increasedto double the amount.
XXXVII. The forgery was suspected by the soldiers.They saw that the letter was an expedient to gaintime. They demanded immediate compliance, andaccordingly dismissions from the service were madeout by the tribunes. The payment of the money wasdeferred till the legions arrived in their winter quar­ters. The fifth and one-and-twentieth refused tostir from the camp, till Germanicus, with his ownfinances and the assistance of his friends, made upthe sum required. The first and twentieth legions,under the command of Csecina, proceeded towardsthe city of the Ubians; exhibiting, as they marched,a shameful spectacle, while they carried, amidst thecolours and the Roman eagles, the treasure extortedfrom their general. Germanicus proceeded with ex­pedition to the army on the Upper Rhine, and thererequired the oath of fidelity to the emperor.

A great number had rudders at eachend, that, by a sudden turn of the oars, they mightwork with facility either way. In many of the ships,formed as well to carry sail as to advance with thestroke of the oar, arches were raised on the decks, ofstrength to bear the engines of war, and at the sametime afford room for horses and provisions. The fleetthus equipped, displayed a magnificent spectacle;while the swell of the sails, the alacrity of tho oars,and the bustle of their soldiers struck a general ter­ror. The isle of Batavia was the place appointed forthe general rendezvous. The shore in those partsbeing easy of approach, the troops might be speedilylanded, and again embarked with expedition, so as tospread an alarm through the country. The Rhine,embracing in its course a few small islands, flows inone united stream, till it reaches the point of Bata­via ; where it branches off in two different channels;one running with rapid force along the confines ofGermany, and, till it fall into the ocean, still retain­ing its original name; the other, with a wider butless violent current,, washes the side of Gaul, and bythe inhabitants is called tho Wahal, till at last, losingitself in the Mcuse, it takes the name of that riverand through an immense opening discharges itselfinto the German Ocean.

Meanwhile* having intelligence that thefort upon the river Luppia was invested, he marchedhimself, at tlie head of six legions, to relieve the gar­rison.

" cused during the year of proconsular government ?" That some of his predecessors had been restrained" by the authority of the chief pontiff, was a fact not" to be controverted; but the restraint, in those cases," was the effect of private animosity. At present, by•» the indulgence of the gods, the chief pontiff is the" chief of men; a stranger to all petty jealousies; un," influenced by the cabals of a party, and superior to" the little motives of a private station."
L1X. Lentulus, the augur, and several other sena­tors, opposed the motion. A debate ensued, with somuch diversity of opinion, that the question was re­ferred to tho decision of the supreme pontiff. Tibe­rius was not in haste to determine the point. Irt hisletters to the senate, he mentioned nothing but thehonours decreed to Drusus on his elevation to thetribunitian power; and those he thought good to mo­dify with certain restrictions. He censured, in directterms, the resolution proposed by Silanus, and4 like­wise the motion of Haterius, for fixing up the decreesin letters of gold; condemning both as unconstitu­tional, and repugnant to ancient usage. Letters fromDrusus were, at the same time, read in the senate,modest in the style and turn of expression, but, inthe general opinion, denoting prido and arrogance." Rome," they said, " was reduced to an humble con-" dition, when a young man, raised to the highest dig-5' nity, declines to return thanks to the gods in their"own temples; when he disdains to-honour the se-" nate with his presence, and refuses to attend ihe" usual auspices in his native city. Was it war that" detained him i or did he dread the inconvenience of" a long j«urney, when he was only visiting the coast" of Campania, or pursuing his pleasures on the lakes?" This is the education of him, who is to be the fu-" ture master of the Roman world ! He is tutored in"the political school of his father! Tiberius may" have his reasons for withdrawing himself from the" public eye: the infirmities of age, and the labours"of his life,,afford a colourable pretext; but for" Drusus, what apology can be made ? Pride, rank" pride, is his only motive."

XIII. Two days were allowed to the prosecutors tosupport their charge, six to prepare the defence, andthree for hearing it. Fulcinius Trio began. Theground he took was the avarice and tyranny, withwhich Piso conducted himself, during his administra­tion in Spain. This was starting from a period tooremote. Though convicted on that point, the de­fendant might still repel the present charge ; and ifacquitted, he might be guilty of higher crimes. Ful­cinius was followed by Servseus, Veranius and Vitel-lius; all three exerting Lhemselvcs with equal zeal,but the latter with superior eloquence. The pointsinsisted upon were—" That Piso, incited by malice lo" Germanicus, and his own ambitious views, diffused" a spirit of licentiousness through the Roman army." He corrupted the soldiery, and suffered the allies of" Rome to be plundered with impunity. In conse-" quence of those pernicious acts, the vile and profli-"gate hailed him father of the legions. But his,* conduct was hostile to all good men, and more di­rectly to the friends of Germanicus.

A party of those troops was ordered for­ward under the command «f Julius Indus, a native ofTreves, who was 'then at variance with Florus, and,for that reason, burned with impatience to encounterhis enemy. He gave battle to the rebels, and overan ill-appointed and undisciplined multitude gaineda complete victory. Florus lay for some time con­cealed in lurking places; but at length, finding himselfunable to elude the search of the Roman soldiers, andseeing the defiles and passages guarded on everyside, he died by his own sword. The people of Treves,after this event, returned to their duty.
XLIII. The jEduan commotions were not so easilyquelled. The state was rich and powerful, and theforce necessary to subdue the insurrection lay at aconsiderable distance. Sacrovir strained every nerveto support his cause. He seized the city of Augus-todunum, the capital of the .ffiduans, and took intohis custody the flower of the young nobility, who re­sorted thither from all parts of Gaul, as to a schoolof science and liberal education. By detaining thosepledges, he hoped to attach to his interest their parentsand relations. He supplied the young men witharms, which had been prepared with secrecy by hisdirections. His numbers amounted to less than forty,thousand, a fifth part of which were armed after themanner of the legions: the rest carried hunting-poles,knives, and other instruments of the chase.

and Agrippina, were of a ponderous size; while thosefor Piso and the rest were of inferior value. Piquedat the distinction, Piso exclaimed," This feast is made" for the son of a Roman prince, not of a Parthian" king." In the instant he threw the present made tohimself, with peevish contempt, on the ground, de­claiming with bitterness against the growth of luxury.Germanicus heard his rude invective, but still re­mained master of himself.
LVIII. About this time arrived ambassadors fromArtabanus, king of the Parthians, with instructionsto mention, in terms of respect, the ancient alliancebetween Rome and Parthia, and the desire of the mo­narch to renew their former friendship. As an ear.nest of respect for Germanicus, Artabanus was willingto advance to an interview as far as the Euphrates ;but he made it a condition, that Vonones should beremoved from Syria, where his residence in theneighbourhood of Parthia, gave him an opportunityto carry on secret negotiations with the nobles of therealm, and in time to stir up a revolt. Germanicusanswered with condescension, yet with dignity. Ofthe alliance between Rome and Parthia he spokewith due regard, and the royal visit he considered asan honour to himself. Vonones was removed toPornpeiopolis, on the coast of Cilicia, not so much tocomply with the demands of the Parthian king, as tocurb the insolence of Piso, then linked in ties offriendship with the exiled prince, who had contrived,by marks of respect and magnificent presents, to pur­chase the favour of Plancina.
LIX. In the consulship of Marcus Silanus and Lu­cius Norbanus, Germanicus made a progress intoEgypt, to view the monuments of antiquity, so muchcelebrated in that country. For this journey thegood of the province was his pretext. In fact, byopening the public granaries, he reduced the price ofcorn; and by pursuing popular measures, he gainedthe good-will of the inhabitants. He appeared inpublic without a guard; his feet uncovered, after theGreek fashion; and the rest of his apparel was alsoGreek. In these particulars he took for his model

to Caius Citronius, who commanded the first legion.By that officer'the delinquents were brought to im­mediate justice. The form of proceeding was as fol­lows: The legions under arms were ranged round thetribunal: the criminal was set up to public view; ifthe general voice pronounced him guilty, he wasthrown headlong down, and put to instant death. Inthis mode of punishment the soldier concurred withardour; by shedding the blood of others, he thoughthis own guilt was expiated. The measure, howeverviolent, received no check from Germanicus. Whatwas done had no sanction from his orders. Thecruelty began with the soldiers, and by consequencecould be imputed to no one else. The veterans fol­lowed the example, and in a few days afterwards wereordered to march into Rhsetia, under colour of defend­ing the province from the inroads of the Suevians;but in truth, to remove them from a camp pollutedby rebellion, and in the end made savage by the hor­ror of military execution. A strict review of the cen­turions was the first care of Germanicus. They weroall cited before him; each in person gave in his name,his rank, the place of his birth, ^he length of his ser­vices, the actions in which he had distinguished him­self, and the military honours which he had obtained.If the tribunes, or the legion in general, reported inhis favour, he preserved his station; if taxed by thegeneral voice with avarice or cruelty, he was dis­charged from the service.
XLV. Order and tranquillity were in this mannerrestored; but at the distance of sixty miles, at a placecalled Vetera, riot and disorder still subsisted. Thefifth and twenty-first legions were there in winterquarters. In the late commotions these men werothe first and most active incendiaries. The worst andblackest crimes were by them committed; and now,when the storm was in appeurance over, they still re­tained their former ferocity, unreclaimed by the peni­tence of others, and undismayed by the fate of thosewho had suffered death. To meet this new alarm,Germanicus resolved to equip his fleet, and with the

served as many campaigns, his wife always remainedin Italy. " It was with good reason," he said, " that" in former times, women were neither allowed to" visit the allies of Rome, nor to have any intercourse" with foreign nations. The softer sex brought many" inconveniences : in times of peace they were prone" to luxury, and .in war, easily alarmed. A female"train, in the march of a Roman army, presented" an image of savage manners: it had the appearance" of barbariajjs going to battle.
" That women are by nature feeble, and soon over-" come by hardship, was not the only objection: other" qualities entered into the female character, such as" pride, revenge, and cruelty, and ambition. The love" of power is the predominant passion of the sex, and" in the exercise of it they know no bounds. They" appear in the ranks; they march with the troops;" and they entice the centurions to their party. We" have seen, in a late instance, a woman reviewing" the cohorts, and directing the exercise of the le-"gions. Have we forgot, that as often as rapacity" and extortion have been laid to the account of the" husband, the wife has proved the principal offender?" She no sooner enters the province, than her party is44 formed. The unprincipled attend to pay their ho-" mage. She becomes a politician; she takes the lead" in business, and gives a separate audience. The" husband and the wife appear in public with their"distinct train of attendants. Two tribunals are" established, and the female edict, dicta ted by caprice" and tyranny, is sure to be obeyed. By the Oppian" and other laws, the wife was formerly restrained"within due bounds: at present all decorum is laid" aside; women give the law in families; they preside"in the tribunals of justice, and aspire to be eom-" manders in chief."
XXXIV. To this speech a small number assented;the rest received it with a murmur of disapproba­tion. The business, they said, was not in form be­fore the fathers, and a question of that importanceought not to be drawn into debate by a self-createdcensor like Csecina.

popular condescension. Tiberius was of a differentcharacter: but the minds of men, softened by luxury,and during a long reign dissolved in pleasure, couldnot easily conform to that austerity, which suited therigid temper of the prince.
LV. In the consulship of Drusus Csesar and CaiusNorbanus, a triumph was decreed, to Germanicus,though the war was not yet brought to a conclusion.The prince had concerted his plan of operations forthe ensuing summer; but he thought proper, early inthe spring, to open the campaign, by a sudden irrup­tion into the territories of the Cattians; a people dis­tracted among themselves by the opposite factions ofArminius and jBegestes; the former famous for histreachery to the Romans, and the latter for unshakenfidelity. Arminius was the common disturber of Ger­many; Segestes, on the other hand, had given re­peated proofs of his pacific temper. When measureswere taken for a general insurrection, he discoveredthe conspiracy; and during the banquet which pre­ceded the massacre of Varus, he proposed that hehimself, Arminius, and other chiefs, should be seized,and loaded with irons. By that vigorous measure hewas sure that the minds of the common people wouldbe depressed with fear; and, having lost their chiefs,none would dare to rise in arms. The general, ofcourse, would have leisure to discriminate the inno­cent from the guilty. But Varus was fated to perish,and Arminius struck the blow. In the present junc­ture, Segestes was compelled by the ardour of hiscountrymen to take up arms. He still however re­tained his former sentiments. He had, besides, mo­tives of a private nature: his daughter, whom he hadpromised in marriage to another chief, was ravishedfrom him by Arminius. The father and the son-in-law were by consequence inveterate enemies; and thatconnexion, which between persons mutually well in­clined forms the tenderest friendship, served only toinflame the animosity of the two contending chiefs.
LVI. Encouraged by these dissensions, Germani­cus appointed Csecina to the command of four legions,fire thousand of the allies, and the German recruits

prominent features of Rhescuporis. The princes pre­served at first a show of mutual concord; in timeRhescuporis began to encroach on his nephew, notindeed with open violence, as he knew that Augustus,the founder of both kingdoms, might likewise provethe avenger of wrongs. During that emperor's life,he concealed his designs; but he no sooner heard thatRome had changed masters, than he threw off themask and avowed his ambition. With a band offreebooters he ravaged the country, razed to theground the strong holds and castles, and by everyact of hostility provoked a war.
LXV. To keep things, which were once settled, inthe same unaltered state, was the principal care thatoccupied the anxious spirit of Tiberius. He despatch­ed a centurion to restrain the Thracian kings from anopen rupture. Cotys disbanded his forces. Rhescu­poris resolved to act with craft and subtlety. He pro­posed a conference which, he had no doubt, wouldterminate all their differences. The time and placewere fixed: a negotiation was opened, both pridcesseeming willing to remove all difficulties. Cotyjbrought to the meeting a conciliating spirit; the un­cle meditated a stroke of perfidy. To ratify the pre­liminaries, he proposed a banquet. The parties met,and protracted their festivity to a late hour of thenight. Amidst the joys of wine, and in the momentof revelry, Rhescuporis attacked his nephew, unsus­pecting and unprovided. The deluded prince urgedin vain the rights of kings, the laws of hospitality, andthe gods of their forefathers. He was loaded withirons. His treacherous uncle made himself master ofall Thrace; and immediately sent despatches to in­form Tiberius that a dangerous conspiracy againsthis life had been defeated by timely vigilance. In themean time, under colour of an enterprise against theBasternians and the Scythians, he made levies ofhflrse and foot, determined, at all events, to be pre­pared for a defensive war.

cus more warmly to his interest. They consideredhim, by the maternal line, of higher birth than Dru-sus; Marc Antony was his grand-father, and Augus­tus Csesar his great uncle. On the other hand, Pom-ponius Atticus, the great grand-father of Drusus, hav­ing never risen above the rank of a Roman knight,seemed to tarnish the lustre of the Claudian line. Themerit of Agrippina weighed greatly in the scale. Shehad brought to Germanicus a numerous offspring;and her character, free from blemish, placed her in apoint of view superior to the younger Livia, the wifoof Drusus. The two brothers, amidst the heat of con­tending parties, lived in perfect harmony: their friendswere at variance, but the princes loved each other.
XLIV. Drusus was soon after sent to command thearmy in Illyricum. In that school of military sciencehe might improve in the ert of war, and gain the af­fections of the army. The camp, Tiberius thought,would wean a young man from the dissolute man­ners of the capital. He had still another motive: whilehis two sons were at the head of the legions, hemight live in security, free from danger, and everypossible alarm. But the ostensible reason for the ex­pedition of Drusus, was an application from the Sue-vians, praying the assistance of Rome against theCheruscans, who had turned their disappointed rageagainst their countrymen. The fact was, Germanybeing at thai time evacuated by the Romans, the dif­ferent nations of that country, no longer dreading aforeign invasion, began, according to the genius ofbarbarians, to quarrel among themselves. The pre­sent difference was a struggle for power between tworival states. The strength on each side was nearlyequal; the abilities of the chiefs much upon a balance;but the name of king was detested by the Suevians,and, by consequence, Maroboduus was unpopular.On the opposite side, Arminius, the champion of li­berty, was the idol of his country.
XLV. Arminius took the field at the head of a con­siderable army. The Cheruscans, and a large bodyof allies, accustomed to fight under him, followed hisstandard. To these were added the Semnonss and

shame and remorse succeeded, and every breast wastouched with sympathy. All lamented the conditionof Agrippina. They called to mind the splendour ofher father Agrippa; they recollected the majesty ofAugustus, her grand-father; they remembered Dru-sus, her father-in-law: her own personal accomplish­ments, her numerous issue, and her virtue, endearedher to the army. Her son, they said, was a native ofthe camp; he was educated in the tents of the legions;and surnamed Caligula, from the boots so called,which, to win the affections of the soldiers, he worein common with the meanest of the army. Amidstthese reflections, the honour intended for the peopleof Treves made the deepest impression. Stung bythat idea, they pressed forward to Agrippina; theyentreated her to stay; they opposed her passage; theyran in crowds to Germanicus, imploring him not tolet her depart. The prince, still warm with mixedemotions of grief and indignation, addressed them inthe following manner: .
XLII. " My wife and child are ever dear to me, but"no more so than my father and the commonwealth." But the emperor will be safe in his own imperial"dignity, and the commonwealth has other armies to" fight her battles. For my wife and children, if from" their destruction you might derive additional glory," I could yield them up a sacrifice in such a cause: at"present, 1 remove them from the rage of frantic men." If horrors are still to multiply, let my blood glut"your fury. The great-grandson of Augustus, and"the daughter-in-law of Tiberius, need not be left to"fill the measure of your iniquity. Without that"horrible catastrophe the scene of guilt may end."But let me ask you, in these last few days what"have you not attempted? What have you left un-"violated? By what name shall I now address you?"Shall I call you soldiers? Soldiers! who have dared" to besiege the son of your emperor! who have made"him a prisoner in his own intrenchments! Can I"call you citizens? Citizens! who have trampled un-* der your feet the authority of the senate; who have" violated the most awful sanctions, even those which

exertions to repair the losses of the army; each nationoffering, according to their respective abilities, a sup­ply of arms, of horses, and money. Germanicusthanked them for their zeal, but received arms andhorses only.. With his own funds he re'ieved thewants of the soldiers; and to obliterate, or at leastsoften the recollection of past misfortunes, he unitedwith generosity the most conciliating manners. Hevisited the sick; he applauded their bravery; he ex­amined their wounds; he encouraged some by pro­mises; he roused others to a sense of glory; and ingeneral, filled all hearts with zeal for his person andthe success of his arms.
LXXII. Triumphal ornaments were this year de­creed to Aulus Csecina, Lucius Apronius, and CaiusSilius, for their conduct under Germanicus. The titleof Father of his Country, so often pressed upon himby the people, Tiberius once more declined; norwould he consent that men should be sworn on his actsthough a vote for that purpose had passed the senate.For this self-denial, he alleged the instability of hu­man affairs, and the danger of the sovereign, alwaysgrowing in proportion to the eminence on which hestands. Popular as this sentiment was, no man thoughtit sincere. He who had lately revived, in all its ri­gour, the law of violated majesty, could not be consi­dered as the friend of civil liberty. The title, indeed,of that law was known in ancient times, but the spi­rit of it differed from the modern practice. Duringthe old republic, the treachery that betrayed an army,the seditious spirit that threw the state into convul­sion!, tne corrupt administration that impaired themajesty of the Roman people, were the objects of thelaw. Men were arraigned for their actions, but wordswere free. Augustus was the first who warped thelaw to new devices. The licentious spirit of CassiusSeverus, whose satirical pen had ridiculed the mosteminent of both sexes, excited the indignation ofthe prince; and the pains and penalties of violatedmajesty were, by a forced construction, extended todefamatory libels. After his example, Tiberius, beingasked by the prator, Pompeius Macer, whether in

erful combination, Silanus stood alone, obliged, with­out any powers of oratory, to make his own defencewith fear and trembling; a situation that might disarmthe noblest talents. Tiberius helped to increase hisdifficulties. With a stern tone of voice, and a con­tracted brow, he pressed the defendant with suddenquestions, never suffering him to pause a moment,either to repel or elude the charge. Silanus wasobliged to admit several points, rather than seem torefute or baffle the inquiry of the emperor. His veryslaves, to make them competent witnesses, were soldby auction to the public officer; and, to make de­struction sure, Tiberius added the crime of violatedmajesty, that none of the prisoner's family or friendsmight presume to assist in the defence. Silanus de­sired an adjournment of a few days. In thatinterval,abandoning all his hopes, he sent a memorial to Ti­berius, in a style sufficiently humble, but still with thespirit of a man who felt himself oppressed, and daredto speak the language of reproach/
LXVI1I. Tiberius remained inflexible; but, to givethe colour of precedent to his final sentence, he or- 4dcred the proceedings against Volesus Messala whohad also been proconsul of Asia, with the record ofAugustus, and the decree made on that occasion, tobe read. He then collected the votes, beginningwith Lucius Piso. That senator, after some flou­rishes in praise of the emperor's clemency, concluded,that Silanus should be interdicted from fire and wa­ter, and banished to the isle of Gyarus. The fathersconcurred in the same opinion, when Cneius Lentu.lus proposed, by way of mitigation that the estatewhich descended to Silanus from his mother, shouldnot be included in the general forfeiture, but vestedin the grandson. Tiberius agreed to the amendment.The business seemed to be at an end, when CorneliusDolabella rose to show, that his servile spirit had notdeserted him. He launched out into a sharp invec­tive'against the morals of Silanus, grafting on it amotion, that no man of dissolute manners should beeligible to the government of provinces; and of thisincapacity the emperor should be the the sole judge. ,

to their charge by Tiberius. In the course of theirdebate, Quintus Haterius and Mamercus Scaurus hadthe misfortune to alarm that gloomy and suspicioustemper: the first, by asking. "How long is it your" pleasure, Csesar, that the commonwealth shall want"ahead to direct it?" Scaurus, by saying, "Since" the prince has not interposed the tribunitian au-" thority to prevent the report of the consuls, there is" room to hope that he will yield to the entreaties of" the senate." Tiberius took fire at what was saidby Haterius, and broke out with sudden vehemence :to Scaurus he made no reply; resentment had takenroot in his heart, and for that reason was smotheredin silence.
Fatigued at length by the clamours of the senate,and the solicitation of individuals, ho gave way bydegrees: not expressly declaring his consent; but, ashe said, to end the mutual trouble of repeated refusalsand unwearied importunity. It may be related as a\ fact, that Haterius, on the following day, attendingat the palace, to mitigate resentment by an apology,narrowly escaped being put to death by the guards.In a suppliant posture he clasped the emperor's knees;and in that moment Tiberius, entangled perhaps bythe petitioner, or making a false step, fell to theground. This provoked the soldiers upon duty.Haterius was saved from their fury: but the dangerthat threatened a man of his illustrious character,made no impression on the prince; nor did he relenttill Livia exerted all her power and influence. Tibe­rius yielded at length to the solicitations of his mo­ther.
XIV. The senate,.at their next meeting, began tooffer the incense of adulation to Livia. It was pro­posed to confer upon her the title of Parent; thatname was thought too general; the more distinctiveappellation of Mother of her Country was movedas an amendment. It was further proposed, with thegeneral concurrence, that to the name of the Emperorshould be added, The Son of Julia. Tiberius op­posed these several motions; honours, he said, oughtnot to be lavished on women; in what regarded hisB2

The honours due to the gods" were no longer sacred; Augustus claimed equal wor-" ship. Temples were built, and statues were erected" to him : a mortal man was adored, and priests and
, " pontiffs were appointed to pay him impious homage." In calling Tiberius to the succession, he neither" acted from the motives of private affection, nor of" regard for the public welfare. He knew the arro-" gance and innate cruelty of the man, and from the" contrast hoped to derive new lustre on himself."That he knew the inward frame and cast of Tiberius,appears from a fact that happened a few years before.The business of granting to that prince a renewal ofthe tribunitian power, was depending in the senate.Augustus, in his speech upon that occasion, madehonourable mention of him; but, at the same time,threw out oblique reflections on his conduct, his de­portment, and his manners. With affected tender­ness he seemed willing to palliate all defects; but themalice of the apology wounded the deeper.

" painful pre-eminence, exposed to danger, and sub-" ject to the vicissitudes of fortune. In a city so well" provided with men of illustrious character, was it" adviseable to confide the whole to a single ruler?:." The several departments of public business would" be better filled by a coalition of the best and ablest" citizens." In this strain Tiberius delivered himself^with dignity of sentiment, it is true, but nothing from,the heart. A profound master of dissimulation, he',had from nature, or the force of habit, the art of be- |ing dark and unintelligible. Even upon occasionswhen duplicity was useless, he spoke in short andbroken hints, the sense suspended, mysterious, andindecisive. Intending at present to conceal his sen­timents, he was of course more involved than ever.The senators, dreading nothing so much as the crimeof knowing his character, broke out in a strain ofsupplication; they molted into tears; they pouredforth entreaties; with uplifted hands they looked tothe gods; they turned to the statue of Augustus, andat times fell prostrate at the knees of Tiberius. Thussurrounded he called for a state-paper, and orderedit to be read. It set forth an estimate of the empireand its resources, the number of citizens, the allies ofRome, an account of the naval strength, the names ofthe conquered kingdoms^ and provinces; the sub­sidies, tributes, and the amount of the revenue, withthe necessary disbursements of government, and thedemands for secret service. The whole was in thehand-writing of Augustus. It concluded with his ad­vice, never to aim at an extension of empire : an im­portant rule of policy; but was it the result of wisdom ?or did he view with a malignant eye the fame thatmight accrue to his successor? ,
XII. The senate still continuing, with prostrateservility, to press their suit, Tiberius let fall an ex­pression, intimating that though unequal to the whole,he was willing to undertake any part that might becommitted to his care. Inform us, Csesar, said AsiniusGallus, what part do you choose? Disconcerted byso unexpected a question, Tiberius paused for a mo­ment; but soon collecting himself, " To choose," he

" without knowledge or experience; he tears the laurel" from another's brow, and founds his merit on fraud" and murder: he fell by surprise upon three legions," and put an unsuspecting general, with his whole" army, to the sword. All Germany has had reason to" rue the carnage of that day; nor has Arminius any" thing to boast. His wife and his son are languishing" in Roman chains. Has my conduct producedsodread-" ful a catastrophe? Tiberius, at the head of twelve"legions, advanced against me; but the glory of the" German name suffered no diminution. The peaceK which followed was made on equal terms. For that" treaty I have no reason to blush. Hostilities were" suspended, and you gained time to deliberate which" was most advisable, war with Rome, or a safe and" honourable peace."
The two armies were in this manner animated bytheir respective chiefs. The several nations addedtheir own private motives. The Cheruscans tookthe field to maintain their ancient glory, and theLangobards to defend their liberty recently recovered.The Suevians aimed at an extension of territory. Nobattle was ever fought with more inflamed resent­ment, and none with such equivocal success. Theright wing on both sides were put to flight. A deci­sive action was expected ; when Maroboduus drew offhis forces, and encamped on the neighbouring hills ;acknowledging by his retreat, tho superior strength oftile enemy. Desertion in a little time thinned hisarmy. He retired into the country of tho Marcoma-nians, and thence sent a deputation to Tiberius, inhopes of obtaining succours. The emperor's answerwas, that Maroboduus, in the late war with the Che­ruscans, had given the Romans no assistance ; therewas therefore no pretence for the present application.Drusus, notwithstanding, was despatched, in the man­ner already mentioned to secure the frontiers from theincursions of the enemy, and to maintain the tran­quillity of the empire.

many different routes. In the quarter where theAfricans ravaged the country near Leptis, and thenfled for shelter to the Germantcs, Cornelius Scipio,the proconsul's lieutenant, advanced with his divi­sion. In another quarter, where Cirta lay exposedto the barbarians, the younger Blecsus, the proconsul'sbob, commanded a second detachment. ln tliB inter­mediate part of the country, the commander jn chiefmarched at the head of a chosen body of troops Atall convenient places he threw up entrenchmentsand appointed garrisons, securing every station by aregular chain of posts.
The barbarians found themselves counteracted onevery s'de. Wherever they turned, the Romans wereat hand, in front, in flank, and in the rear. Numberswere surrounded, and either put to the sword, ortaken prisoners. To spread the alarm, the Romanarmy was again subdivided into smaller parties, un­der the command of centurions of approved valourand experience. Nor was the campaign closed, asosual, at the end of the summer. Instead of retiringto winter-quarters in the old provinces, Blsesus keptthe field; he increased the number of his posts andgarrisons, and sent out detachments, lightly armed,with guides acquainted with the course of the coun­try. Tacfarinas could no longer stand at bay. Heshifted his huts, and wandered from place to place.At length his brother was taken prisoner, and Blsesusthought it time to close the campaign., His retreatwas sudden and premature. The province was stillopen to incursions; and the flame of war, thoughsuppressed, was not extinguished. Tiberius, how­ever, considered the enemy as completely vanquished.Besides the honours already granted -to Blsesus, heordered that the legions should salute him by thetitle of Imferator, according to the ancient customof the Roman armies, in the pride of victory flushedwith the generous ardour of warlike spirits. In thetime of the republic, this was a frequent custom, in­somuch that several, at the same time, without pre-s or distinction, enjoyed that military honour.

were not enough to glut the malice of Tiberius; heattended the ordinary courts of justice; taking hisseat near the corner of the tribunal, that he might notdisplace the prsetor from his curule chair. In his pre­sence, which had the effect of controlling the intriguesof the great, several just decisions were pronounced:but even this was big with mischief; truth was served,and liberty went to ruin. Pius Aurelius, a memberof the senate, complained to that assembly, that, bythe making of a public road, and laying an aqueduct,the foundation of his house was ruined; he thereforeprayed to be indemnified. The prsetors of the treasuryopposed his petition. Tiberius, however, struck withthe justice of the case, paid the value of the house.The littleness of avarice was no part of his character.When fair occasions called for liberality, he wasready to open his purse; and this munificent spirithe retained for a long time, when every other virtuewas extinguished. Propertius Celer, a man of prae­torian family, but distressed in his circumstances, de­sired to abdicate his rank of senator. The state ofindigence in which he lived being found to be theconsequence of hereditary poverty, he received a do­nation of a thousand great sesterces. A number ofapplications of the same nature followed soon after;but Tiberius required that the allegations of each pe­tition should be proved. The austerity of his naturemixed with his best actions a leaven of harshness,that embittered his favours. By the rigour of theprince distress was silenced: ingenuous minds chose tolanguish in obscurity rather than seek, by humiliat­ing confessions, a precarious, and at best a painful,relief.

the Langobards, two Suevian nations revolted fromMaroboduus. By this defection the superiority hadbeen decidedly with Arminius, had not Ihguiomer .thrown his whole weight into the opposite scale. Forthis conduct the pride of the man was the excitingmotive. Arminius was the son of Inguiomer's brother;and the uncle, now a ^veteran soldier, disdained toserve under his nephew, and obey the orders of a boy.The two armies were drawn up in order of battle; onboth sides equal ardour, and equal hopes of victory.The Germans no longer carried on a desultory war,in detached parties, and irregular bodies: their longconflict with the Romans had made them soldiers.Discipline was introduced; they followed the colours,they supported the broken ranks, and with promptalacrity obeyed the word of command. Arminiusappeared on horseback, rushed through the ranks,and animating his men to deeds of valour. He con­gratulated them on the recovery of their liberty: hegloried in the slaughter of Varus and his legions; hepointed to the spoils of victory, and the Roman wea­pons then in hands of numbers; he called JYIarobo- 'duus a coward and a fugitive, who never fleshed hissword in battle, but fled for shelter to the Hercynianforest, where, by negotiation, by bribes and embassies,he patched up an ignominious peace. A traitor tohis country, and the slave of Csesar, he was more anobject of vengeance than Varus and his legions. Heconjured them to remember the battles they hadfought, and the glorious issue of all their labours." The Romans," he said," have abandoned Germany;" they are exterminated; and if men desire to know" who were the conquerors, the event of the war will" tell."
XLVI. Maroboduus, in the mean time, was not in­active. Of himself he talked in magnificent terms,and of the enemy with contempt and indignation.Holding Inguiomer by the hand, " Behold," he said," in this brave warrior, the support and glory of the" Cheruscan lame! To him they are indebted for the" success of their arms. Arminius had no share in the"conduct of the war; a rash presumptuous man,

plained; ensnaring subtleties were removed; andthe evil, though not wholly cured, was palliated forthe present.
XXIX. About this time Nero, the eldest son ofGermanicus, was entering on the state of manhood.Tiberius recommended him to the favour of thesenate, adding his request, that the young princemight be excused from serving the office of the vi-gintivirate, with leave, five years earlier than thetime limited by law, to stand candidate for the ques-torship. As a precedent for this indulgence he citedthe example of Augustus, who had made the like ap­plication for himself and his brother Drusus. Theproposal was a mockery, and, accordingly, men heardit with derision. Even in the reign of Augustus,there were in all probability, numbers who laughed,in secret, at the new way of commanding by petition.The artifice, however, was at that time not impolitic rthe grandeur of the Ctcsars was in its infancy, andthe forms of the old republic were still remembered.With regard to the request made by Tiberius, it mayhe observed, that the relation between the step-fatherand the sons of his wife did not create so tender arkinterest, as the natural affection of a grand-father forhis grand-son. The senate not only granted whatwas asked, but added a seat in the pontifical college.The day, on which the young prince made his firstappearance in the forum, was distinguished by alargess to the people, who saw with pleasure a sonof Germanicus rising to the estate of manhood. Hismarriage with Julia, the daughter of Drusus, wassoon after celebrated, and diffused a general satisfac­tion. But another match, then in contemplation, be­tween the son of Claudius and a daughter of Seja-nus, was received by the people with every mark ofdiscontent. Men objected, that the lustre of the im­perial family would be tarnished, and the ambitionof Sejanus, already suspected, would, when strength­ened by that connexion, tower above the rank of acitizen.

It does not appear, either in the historians of thetime, or in the public journals, that Antonia, the mo­ther of Germanicus, took any part in the funeral ce­remony. Agrippina, Drusus, Claudius, and the restof the prince's relations, are registered by name; butof Antonia no mention is made. She was probablyhindered from attending by want of health, or thesensibility of a mother might be unequal to so severea trial. To speak my own opinion, I am inclined tobelieve that nothing but the emperor and his mothercould restrain her from the last human office to herson. If all three absented themselves, equal afflictionmight be inferred; and, the uncle and grandmothermight be supposed to find a precedent in the conductof the mother.
IV. The day on which tho remains of Germanicuswere deposited in the tomb of Augustus, was remark­able for sorrow in various shapes. A deep and mourn­ful silence prevailed, as if Rome v/as become a desert;and, at intervals, the general groan of a distractedmultitude broke forth at once. The streets werecrowded: the Field of Mars glittered with torches:the soldiers were underarms; themagistrates appearedwithout the ensigns of their authority; and the peo­ple stood ranged in their several tribes. All, withone voice, despaired of the commonwealth; they spoketheir minds without reserve, in the anguish of thoirhearts forgetting the master that reigned over them.Nothing, however, touched Tiberius so near, as thedecided affection of the people for Agrippina, whowas styled the ornament of her country, the onlyblood of Augustus, and the last remaining model ofancient manners. With hands upraised, the peopleinvoked the gods, imploring them to protect the chil­dren of Germanicus from the malice of perniciousenemies.
V. There were at that time men of reflection whothought the whole of the ceremony short of that fu­neral pomp which the occasion required. The mag­nificence displayed in honour of Drusus, the father ofGermanicus, was put in contrast to the present fru­gality. " Augustus, in the depth of winter, went as

out of the case, as a matter within the provisions ofthe Julian law. With regard to her calumnious lan­guage, Tiberius desired that a distinction might be ,'made. If it appeared in proof, that she had spokenirreverently of Augustus, the law he said, should takeits course ; but personalities levelled at himself mightpass with impunity. A question was put by the conrsul touching tho liberties taken with the emperor'smother. Tiberius made no reply. At the neximeeting of the senate he informed the fathers thatwords affecting Livia were, by her own desire, neverto be imputed as a crime. Varilia was acquitted onthe law of majesty. With regard to the charge ofadultery, Tiberius requested the fathers to soften therigour of their sentence. In conformity to ancientpractice, he was of opinion, that the relations of theoffender might remove her to the distance of two hun­dred miles from Rome. This mode of punishment wasadopted. Manlius, her paramour, was banished fromItaly and Africa.
LI. The office of prator becoming vacant by thedeath of Vipsanius Gallus, the appointment of a suc­cessor gave occasion to a warm and eager contest.Haterius Agrippa, nearly related to Germanicus, wasdeclared a candidate. Drusus and Germanicus, bothstill at Rome, espoused his interest. It was, however,a settled rule, that the person who had the greatestnumber of children should be deemed to have the su­perior title. From this line of decision many of thelathers were unwilling to depart. Tiberius saw withinward satisfaction the senate wavering between tholaw and the wishes of his sons. The law as may beimagined, proved'too feeble. The two princes car­ried the question, though not without a strong con­tention, and by a small majority. This, however,was no more than what often happened in bettertimes, when laws were still in force, but had to strug­gle with power, and were often obliged to yield tosuperior interest.

LXXXI.' Of the consular elections, either in thisyear, or during the rest of his reign, nothing can besaid with precision. His own speeches, as well as thehistorians of the time, are so much at variance, thatnothing like system can be traced. We see the em­peror, in some instances, holding the name of thecandidate in reserve, yet by an account of his birth,his public conduct, and his military services, pointingdirectly to the man. At other times he refuses eventhat satisfaction, content with general directions tothe candidates, not to embroil the election by intrigueor bribery, but to leave the whole to his management.His custom in general was to profess, that ho knewno candidates but those, whose names he had trans­mitted to the consuls; others, he said, were free tooffer themselves, if, from their merit or their interest,they conceived hopes of success. With speeches ofthis nature, plausible indeed, but unsubstantial, thepeople were amused. A show of liberty was held forth,fair in appearance, but deceitful, and, for that reason,tending to plunge mankind in deeper servitude.

conducted him to the senate-house; all things an-, nouriced the sovereign. In his despatches to the army,he was already the successor of Augustus: he spokethe style and language of a recognised emperor,without reserve, and in the tone of power, equivocalonly when he addressed the senate.
The fact was, Tiberius dreaded Germanicus. Acommander in chief, who had so many legions underhis direction, who had formed connexions with theallies of Rome, and was besides the idol of the people,might choose to seize the government, rather thanlinger in expectation. For this reason the fatherswere to be managed. There was at the bottom ano­ther motive ; if, in appearance, he owed his elevation,not to the intrigues of an ambitious mother, or theadoption of a superannuated emperor, but to thevoice of the, people, it would redound more to hiaglory. The opportunity was also fair, to pry into thetemper and dispositions of the leading senators. Theevent showed that his indecision was policy in dis­guise. He noted the words of men ; he watched theirlooks ; warped every circumstance into a crime ; and,hoarding all in his memory, gathered rancour for afuture day.
VIII. At the first meeting of the senate, the funeralof Augustus was the only subject of debate. Theemperor's will was brought forward by the vestalvirgins. Tiberius and Livia were declared his heirs.The latter was adopted into the Julian family, withthe additional title of Augusta. His grand-childrenand their issue were next in succession ; in the thirddegree he named the nobles of E^me: not indeed frommotives of personal regard, for the greater part hadbeen for a long time obnoxious; but a bequest so ge­nerous and magnificent might gain the applause offuture ages. In the rest of his legacies the will wasin the style of a Roman cUizen: if we except theclauses, whereby he gave to the Roman people fourhundred thousand great sesterces, to the inferior com­monalty five-and-thirty thousand, to each prsetoriansoldier one thousand small sesterces, and to everycommon man belonging to the legions three hundred,

tbority, forced their way into the vestibule, deter­mined to make themselves heard and seen by thefamily. The prisoner was then at table, intending tomake an elegant banquet the last pleasure of his life;but a mind in agony could relish nothing. Dis­tracted, terrified, he called on his servants to despatchhim; he laid hold of his slaves, and endeavoured toforce a sword into their hands. The servants in agi­tation, made an effort to escape, and, in the struggle,overturned the light that stood upon the table. Thisto Libo was funereal darkness: he seized the moment,and gave himself two mortal stabs. His groansalarmed the freedmen, who crowded round their mas­ter. The soldiers followed; and seeing him at thepoint of death, had the decency to withdraw. Theprosecution, however, did not die with the unfortu­nate victim. It was resumed in the senate with un-abating,severity. Tiberius made an end of the busi­ness, by declaring that, if the criminal had not donejustice on himself, he intended, notwithstanding themanifest proof of his guilt, to have recommended himto the mercy of the fathers.
XXXII. The estate of the deceased was dividedamong the informers. Such of them as were of sena-torian rank were promoted to the prsetorship, withoutthe form of an election. Various motions were madein the senate: Cotfa Messalinus proposed that theimage of Libo should not be carried in the funeralprocessions of his kindred; Cneius Lentulus, that thesurname of Drusus should be no longer assumed bythe Scribonian family. On the motion of PomponiusFlaccus, days of public thanksgiving were voted; andgifts were ordered to be presented to Jupiter, Mars,and Concord, at the desire of Lucius Puppius, AsiniusGallus, Papius Mutilus, and Lucius Apronius.- Itwas further decreed, that the ides of September, theday on which Libo despatched himself, should be ob­served as a festival. Of these resolutions, and theirseveral authors, I have thought proper to record thememory, that adulation may be branded to all poste­rity, and that men may mark how long a servilespirit has been the canker of the commonwealth.

XVIII. This speech was received with acclamations.Various passions heaved in every breast. Some pre­sented theirbodies seamed with stripes; others pointedto their heads grown gray in the service; numbersshowed their tattered clothing, and their persons al­most naked. At length the frenzy of the malcon­tents knew no bounds. Their first design was to in­corporate the three legions into one ; but which shouldgive its name to the united body, was the question;mutual jealousy put an end to the project. Anotherscheme took place; the eagles of the three legions,with the colours of the cohorts, were crowded toge­ther without preference or distinction. They threwup sods of earth, and began to raise a tribunal.Amidst the tumult Blssus arrived: he called aloud toall; he laid hold of individuals: he offered himself totheir swords; and " Here," he said, " behold your vic-", tim; imbrue your hands in the blood of your general.",Murder is a crime less horrible than treason to your44 prince. 1 will either live to command the legions", entrusted to mc: or, if you are determined to revolt,"despatch me first; that, when this frenzy is over,"you may wake to shame, to horror, and remorse."

Junius Blsesus, the proconsul or jiinca, numuxmade no scruple to declare, that his motive for be­stowing that high reward, was to pay a complimentto Sejanus, as the proconsul was his uncle.
LXXIII.I Blsesus, however, had fairly earned hishonours. Tacfarinas, often repulsed, was never de­feated. He found resources in the interior parts ofAfrica, and returned to the conflict with new vigour.He had at length the arrogance to send an embassyto Tiberius,/ demanding lands for himself and hiaarmy, or nothing should make an end of the war. Ti­berius, it is said, was upon no occasion so little mas­ter of himself. "It was an insult to the imperial" majesty, and the Roman name. Shall a deserter," a wandering vagabond, presume to treat on equal"terms? Even Spartacus, though he had defeated" consular armies, and spread desolation with sword" and fire through the realms of Italy, was not allow-" ed to negotiate terms of peace, though the com-" monwealth, at that time, was well nigh exhausted" by Sertorius, and the Mithridatic war. Even then"no compromise was admitted; the dignity of the" state was saved. And shall a flourishing empire de-" scer.d so low as to compound with Tacfarinas, and," by granting lands, become the purchaser of peace" at the hands of a freebooter and a robber?" Stungby these reflections, Tiberius ordered Blsesus to se­duce the followers of Tacfarinas by promises of afree pardon to all who should lay down their arms;but as to their chief, he must strain every nerve tosecure the person of that daring adventurer.
LXXIV. The promised amnesty reduced the num­bers of the enemy; and Blsesus, adopting a new modeof war, turned the arts of the wily Numidian againsthimself. Unequal to the legions in a pitched battle,Tacfarinas depended altogether upon the rapidity ofhis motions: he divided his men into small parties;he showed himself in sudden incursions, fled before aregular force, and knew where to lie in ambush.

" The poison is too slow in its operation for the wishes" of my enemies; they want to hasten its effect; and 1"the impatience of Piso has already swallowed up" the province, with the command of the legions. But" Germanicus is not yet deserted by all; his enemies" may still have reason to repent; and the murderer" will find that he has not long to enjoy the wages of" his guilt." In this temper of mind he wrote a let­ter to Piso, in express terms disclaiming all friendshipand connexion with him: as some will have it, hecommanded him to depart from the province. Piso,in fact, did not linger at Seleucia: he embarked im­mediately, but slackened his course; still willing tohover near the coast, in hopes that the death of Ger­manicus would leave the province open to his ambi­tion.
LXXI. The disorder intermitting for a short time,Germanicus had an interval of hope. But the fatalmoment was approaching; he sunk into a mortallanguor; and, finding himself near his end, took leaveof his friends in words to the following effect: " Were" I to die a natural death, yet, thus cut off in the" bloom of life from my family, my children, and my" country, I might think it hard, and call the gods se-" vere in their dispensations.

LXI. Touched by this affecting circumstance, Ger-manicus resolved to pay the last human office to therelics of that unfortunate commander, and his slaugh­tered soldiers. The same tender sentiment diffuseditself through the army: some felt the touch of na­ture for their relations, others for their friends; andall lamented the disasters of war, and the wretchedlot of human kind. Carina was sent forward to ex­plore the woods: where the waters were out. to throwup bridges; and, by heaping loads of earth on theswampy soil, to secure a solid footing. The armymarched through a gloomy solitude. The place pre­sented an awful spectacle, and the memory of a tragi­cal event increased the horror of the scene. The firstcamp of Varus appeared in view. The extent of theground,and the three different inelosures forthe eagles,still distinctly seen, left no doubt that the whole wasthe work of the three legions. Farther on were tracedthe ruins of a rampart, and the hollow of a ditch wellnigh filled up. This was supposed to be the spot wherethe few, who escaped the general massacre, madetheir last effort, and perished in the attempt. Theplains around were white with bones, in some placesthinly scattered, in others lying in heaps, as the menhappened to fall in flight, or in a body resisted tothe last. Fragments of javelins, and the limbs ofhorses, lay scattered about the field. Human skulls,were seen upon the trunks of trees. In the adjacentwoods stood the savage altars where the tribunes andprincipal centurions were offered up a sacrifice withbarbarous rites. Some of the soldiers who survivedthat dreadful day, and afterwards broke their chains,related circumstantially several particulars. " Here" the commanders of the legions were put to the"sword: on thai spot the eagles were seized. There" Varus received his first wound: and this is the place" where he gave himself the mortal stab, and died by" his own sword.

had the misfortune of being upon bad terms with theemperor, who, during his residence in the Isle ofRhodes, had taken umbrage at the king's behaviour,and from that moment harboured the deepest resent­ment. Archelaus, it is true, had shown him nomark of respect; but that inattention did not originatein pride or arrogance. It was the conduct recom­mended by the confidential friends of Augustus, at atime when Caius Csesar, flourishing in favour, wassent to arrange the affairs of the east. In that junc­ture, to court the friendship of Tiberius would havebeen highly impolitic.
After the failure bf the Csesarian line, and the ele­vation of Tiberius, letters to the eastern prince weredespatched from the emperor's mother, avowing herson's resentment, but offering an entire remission ofpast offences, provided he came in person to solicithis pardon. Archelaus did not perceive the intendedtreachery; or; perceiving it, thought it prudent to dis­semble. He risqued a journey to Rome.
Tiberius received him with pride and sullen aver­sion. The king of Cappadocia was arraigned beforethe senate; and though [he charge was withoutfoundation, a royal mind, not used to acknowledge anequal, much less to bend to the humiliating conditionof a state-criminal, was naturally pierced to the quick.Worn out with grief, and drooping under the infirmi­ties of age, the unhappy monarch died of a brokenheart, or perhaps fell by his own hand. His kingdomwas reduced to a Roman province. With this newsource of wealth, Tiberius declared himself able to di­minish the tax of the hundredth penny,and accordinglychanged it to the two-hundredth. About this timedied Antiochus and Philopater; the former king ofCommagena, and the latter of Cilicia. By their deathstheir kingdoms were thrown into violent convulsions.Two factions were at variance; one, which formed alargo majority, was willing to submit to the govern­ment of Rome; the other contended for the independ­ence of their monarchy. In the same juncture theprovinces of Syria and Judsea prayed to be relievedfrom the burden of oppressive taxes.

LX. By these incendiary speeches all Germany twas roused to action. The Cheruscans took up arms iind the neighbouring states followed their example.Inguiomer, a man long known, and high in the esti­mation of the Romans, declared in favour of Armi­nius: he was uncle to that chieftain. By adopting hismeasures, he added strength to the confederacy. Ger-manicus saw the impending danger. To cause a di-
, version, and avoid the united strength of the enemy,he ordered Csecina, with forty Roman cohorts, topenetrate into the territory of the Bructerians as faras the river Amisia. Pedo, at the head of the cavalry,was directed to march along the confines of the Fri-
' sians. Germanicus, with four legions, embarked onthe lakes. One common place of destination was ap­pointed: the foot, the cavalry, and the fleet, arrivedin due time. The Chaucians joined the RTSman army;the Bructerians set fire to their houses, and abandonedtheir country. Lucius Stertinius, with a detachmentof the light horse, was ordered to pursue the fugitives.That officer came up with the enemy, and put thewhole body to the rout. Amidst the slaughter thatfollowed, some of the soldiers were intent on plunder.Among the spoils was found the eagle of the nine­teenth legion, lost in the massacre of Varus. The armypushed on with vigour to the farthest limit of thoBructerians. The whole country between the riverAmisia and the Luppia, was made a desert.

ample, all military fame was transplanted to otherfamilies, till Camillus, the conqueror of Tacfarinas,once more revived the glory of his ancestors; but hedid it without their talents. He had seen no service,nor was he considered as an officer. Tiberius for thatreason was the more lavish in his praise. Triumphalornaments were decreed to him by the senate; norwas he afterwards ruined by his merit. His moder­ation, and the simplicity of his manners, screenedhim from envy. He enjoyed his honours with impu­nity.
LIII. Tiberius and Germanicus were joint consulsfor the following year; the former for the third time,and the latter for the second. Germanicus, in thisjuncture, was absent from Rome, at the city of Nico-polis in Achaia. He had passed into Dalmatia, on avisit to his brother Drusus. From that place he sailedalong the coast of Illyricum; and after a tempestuousvoyage in the Adriatic and the Ionian seas, arrived atNocopolis, where he was invested with his new digni­ty. Hia fleet had suffered, and took some days to refitfor sea. In the mean time he seized the opportunityto view the Bay of Aetium, rendered famous by thegreat naval victory at that place. He saw the tro­phies consecrated by Augustus, and the lines of MarcAntony's camp. To him, who was grand-nephew toAugustus, and grandson to Marc Antony, the scenewas interesting. Every object reminded him of hisancestors; and every circumstance awakened thosetender sensations, in which the heart unites regretand pleasure. From Nicopolis he proceeded to Athens.In that city, the seat of valour and Of literature, andfor many years in alliance with Rome, he showed hisrespect for the inhabitants by appearing withoutpomp, attended only by a single lictor. The Greeksexhausted their invention to do him honour: inge­nious in the arts of flattery, they took care to blendwith their compliments frequent mention of the re­nowned exploits and memorable sayings of their an­cestors ; and thus, by enhancing their own merit, theythought they gave refinement, and even value, toadulation.

to Cneius Piso, upon condition that he changed ,family name; and that his brother Marcus, dives, "i-of all civil honours, should be condemned to banisi. Vment for the space of ten years, with a sum, however,of fifty thousand great sesterces for his support. Indeference to the solicitations of Livia, it was proposedto grant a free pardon to Plancina.
XVIII. This sentence, in many particulars, wasmitigated by Tiberius. The family name, he said,ought not to be abolished, while that of Marc Antony,who appeared in arms against his country, as well asthat of Julius Antonius, who by his intrigues disho­noured the house of Augustus, subsisted still, andfigured in the Roman annals. Marcus Piso was leftin possession of his civil dignities and his father's for­tune. Avarice, as has been already observed, wasnot the passion of Tiberius. On this occasion, thedisgrace incurred by the partiality shown to Plancina,softened his temper, and made him the more willingto extend his mercy to the son. Valerius Messalinusmoved, that a golden statue might be erected in thetemple of Mars the Avenger. An altar to Venge­ance was proposed by Csecina Severus. Both thesemotions were overruled by the emperor. The principleon which he argued was, that public monuments,however proper in cases of foreign conquest, were notsuited to the present juncture. Domestic calamityshould be lamented, and as soon as possible consignedto oblivion.
Messalinus added to his motion a vote of thanks toTiberius and Livia, to Antonia, Agrippina, and Dru-sus, for their zeal in bringing to justice the enemiesof Germanicus. The name of Claudius was notmentioned. Lucius Asprenas desired to know whe­ther that omission was intended. The consequencewas, that Claudius was inserted in the vote. Uponan occasion like this, it is impossible, not to pause fora moment, to make a reflection that naturally risesout of the subject.

Germany, it was added, hadjoined the league; and Spain was wavering. Therumour, as usually happens, was magnified by thecredulity of the populace. Good men felt for theircountry; the greater part, detesting the present sys­tem, and wishing for nothing so much as a change,enjoyed the confusion, and triumphed in the commondanger. Invective did not spare Tiberius. w In a" difficult and alarming crisis, he was busy in settling" the forms of some new prosecution. Did he mean"to proceed by way of information against Julius" Sacrovir? Was that chieftain to be accused of vio-" lated majesty ? The revolt plainly showed that there" still existed men of undaunted valour, who were" resolved, at the point of the sword, to defy his let-" ters written in blood to the senate; and war, with" all its dangers, was preferable to a sanguinary" peace, under a despotic tyrant." Amidst thesemurmurs of discontent, Tiberius appeared with anunruffled temper, never once changing his look, hisplace of abode, or his habits of life. Is this to be as­cribed to magnanimity ? or did he know by secret in­telligence, that the whole was either false, or magni­fied beyond the truth?
XLV. Silius, in the mean time, having sent beforehim a body of auxiliaries, marched at the head of twolegions into the territory of the Sequanians, a peopleat the extremity of Gaul, bordering on the jEduans,and confederates in the war. He laid waste the coun­try and proceeded, by rapid marches, to Augustodu-num. Nothing could equal the ardour of the legions:the standard-bearers with emulation gave every proofof their alacrity; the common soldiers declared, withone voice, that they wanted no repose: the nightought not to be lost in sleep; let them but see theenemy, they asked no more; victory was sure to fol­

he affected neither pomp nor grandeur. The will be­ing read, the funeral honours were taken into consi­deration. The chief propositions were, that the pro­cession should pass through the triumphal gale; this wasmoved by Asinius Gallus: that the titles of all the lawiof Augustus, and the names of the conquered nations,should be carried before the body, was the motion ofLucius Arruntius. Valerius Messala was of opinion,that the oath of fidelity to Tiberius should be renewedevery year; and being thereupon interrogated by theprince, whether that motion was made with his pri­vity? I made it, said Messala, upon my own sugges­tion ; in matters of public concern, however, it may giveumbrage, the conviction of my own heart shall be theonly rule of my conduct. The age had left no othermode of flattery. The senate with one voice insistedthat the body should be borne to the funeral pile upontheir own shoulders. Tiberius assented with seemingcondescension but real arrogance. The Field ofMars was the place appointed for the ceremony. Aproclamation was issued, warning the populace to re­strain their zeal, and not require that the last dutiesshould be performed in the Forum, as had been donewith tumult and disorder at the funeral of JuliusCsesar.
On the day appointed for the ceremony, the sol­diers were drawn up under arms; a circumstance thatserved only to provoke the ridicule of all who remem­bered the day, or heard of it from their fathers, whenCsesar the dictator was put to death. In that earlyperiod of slavery, and in the first emotions of joy forliberty in vain recovered, the blow for freedom seemeda murder to some, and to others a glorious sacrifice.But in the present juncture, when a prince worn outwith age, who had grown gray in power, and left along train of heirs, was to receive the last funeral ob­sequies, at such a time to call forth the military, in or­der to secure a quiet interment, was a vain parade, asridiculous as it was unnecessary.

countable to the sovereign only, was a branch of theimperial prerogative: and if Tiberius departed from it,he ceased to reign.
VII. At Rome, in the mean time, all things tendedto a state of abject servitude. Consuls, senators, andRoman knights contended with emulation, who shouldbe the most willing slaves. The higher each person'srank, the more he struggled for the foremost place inbondage. All appeared with a studied countenance.An air of gaiety might dishonour the memory of Au­gustus, and sadness would ill bent the opening of anew reign. A motley farce was acted; and grief andjoy, distress and flattery, succeeding by turns, werecuriously mixed and blended. The oath of fidelity toTiberius was taken first by the two consuls, SextusPompeius and Sextus Apuleius, and by them adminis­tered to Seius Strabo and Caius Turraruus; the for­mer, prefect of the prsetorian bands ; the latter, con­troller of the corn and public stores. Their examplewas followed by the senate, the army, and the mass ofthe people.
To make every thing move from the consuls, wasthe policy of Tiberius. He affected the appearanceof republican principles, as if the constitution stillsubsisted, and he himself had formed no design todestroy it. The very proclamation, by which heconvened the senate, professed no other authoritythan that of the tribunitian power conferred uponhim by Augustus. The proclamation itself wasshort, and penned in modest terms; importing, that44 the business of the meeting was, to decree funeral" honours to his debased father: as to himself, he" could not leave the body; that office of piety was" the only function that he presumed to exercise."This was, indeed, the language of moderation; butAugustus was no sooner dead, than he assumed thesupreme authority: in his character of imperator, hetook upon him the whole military command; he gavethe word to the pretorian guards: sentinels were sta­tioned round the palace; the soldiers appeared underarms; the magnificence of a court was seen in all itsforms; guards attended him to the forum; guards

ceed to the ardour of affection, and both begin towean themselves from each other; the prince, whenthe power of giving is exhausted; and the minister,when avarice has no more to crave.
XXXI. The year, which we are now to open, standsdistinguished by the joint consulship of the father andthe son; Tiberius, for the fourth time, and Drusus,the second. It is true that, two years before, Ger-manicus shared the same honour; but their unionwas not founded in sincerity and mutual esteem.Throughout that year Tiberius beheld his colleaguewith a malignant eye. The tie of affinity betweenthem was not so close as the present. Tiberius hadscarce entered on the office in conjunction with Dru-sus, when, pretending to recruit his health, he remo­ved into Campania, perhaps even then meditatingthat long retreat, which was afterwards his plan oflife; perhaps, intending to give Drusus the honour ofdischarging the consular functions, without the assist­ance of his father. An incident soon occurred, initself of little moment, but by the heat of party it kin­dled to a flame, and afforded to the young consul anopportunity to gain the popular esteem. A complaintwas made to the senate by Domitius Corbulo, for­merly one of the praters, stating that Lucius Sylla, ayouth of illustrious rank, had refused, in a late showof gladiators, to give place to his superior in point ofyears. The grave and elderly were on the side ofCorbulo. They saw the rights of age infringed, andthe example of ancient manners treated with contempt.Mamercus Scaurus and Lucius Arruntius undertookthe defence of Sylla, and with the rest of his relationsformed a party in his favour. A warm debate ensued.The practice of good times was stated, and severaldecrees, enforcing the reverence due to age, werecited as decisi'e authority. Drusus, by a qualifyingspeech, allayed the ferment. Corbulo declared him­self satisfied by the apology made by MamercusScaurus, who was uncle as well as father-in-law toSylla, and, besides, the most eloquent orator of his# time. That business being thus amicably settled, thestate of the public roads was made the subject of de^

" from his youth to the pomp and pride of consulships" and triumphs. During the years which he passed" in a seeming retreat, but real exile, in the isle of" Rhodes, he meditated nothing so much as plans of" future vengeance, clandestine pleasures, and the arts" of dissimulation." To these reflections the publicadded their dread of a mother, raging with all the im­potence of female ambition: a whole people, they said,were to be enslaved by a woman, and two young men,who in the beginning would hang heavy on the state,and in the end distract and rend it to pieces by theirown dissensions.
V. While these and other observations of a similarnature employed the public mind, the health o'f Au­gustus declined apace. The wickedness of his wifewas not supposed to remain inactive. A rumour pre­vailed, that Augustus had gone a few months before,in a private manner, with a select party, and Fabius,Maximus, his confidential friend, to the island of Pla-'nasia, on a visit to Agrippa. The meeting was saidto be of the tenderest nature: tears were shed by both,and a scene of mutual affection followed. From thatinterview hopes were conceived, that the young princewould be once more restored to the favour and pro­tection of his grandfather. The secret soon transpired:Fabius communicated the whole to his wife Marcia,and by her it was conveyed fo Livia. Augustus knewthat he had been betrayed. Maximus died soon after,perhaps, by his own hand: but of that nothing can besaid with certainty. At his funeral Marcia was heard,in the vehemence of distress and sorrow, to accuseherself of being accessary to the death of her husband.However that may be, Tiberius had scarcely set footin Illyricum when he received despatches from hismother, requiring his immediate presence. He ar­rived at Nola: but whether Augustus was still living,or breathed his last, must be left in doubt. By Livia'sorder the palace and all the avenues were closelyguarded : favourable accounts were issued from timeto time; and with that artifice mankind was amusedtill all proper measures were concerted.

far as Ticinum to meet the body; and, never quit-*f ting it afterwards, entered the city in the public pro-" cession. The bier was decorated with the images of" the Claudian and the Livian families: tears were4* shed in the forum; a funeral oration was delivered" from the rostrum; and every honour, as well of an-" cient as of modern invention, was ofFered to the me-" mory of the deceased. How different was the case"at present! Even the distinctions usually granted" to persons of illustrious rank, were refused to Ger-" manicus. The body was committed to the funeral" pile in a foreign land; that was an act of necessity;" but, to compensate for the first deficiency, too much" could not be done. One day's journey was all that" a brother performed. The uncle did not so much" as go to the city-gate. Where now the usage of" ancient times ? Where the bed on which the image" of the deceased lay in state? Where the verses in" honour of departed virtue ? Where the funeral pane-" gy"c, and tne tear that embalms the dead ? If real" tears were not ready to gush, where, at least, were., " the forms of grief? and where the decency of pre-"tended sorrow ?"
VI. Tiberius was not ignorant of what passed. Toappease the murmurs of the people, he issued a pro­clamation, in which it was observed, " that eminent" men had at various times fallen in the service of" their country, though none were so sincerely lament-" ed as Germanicus. The regret shown on the pre-" sent occasion, did honour to the virtue of the people," and the imperial dignity ; but grief must have its" bounds. That which might be proper in private" families, or in petty states, would ill become the" grandeur of a people who gave laws to the world." Recent affliction must have its course. The heart" overflows, and in that discharge finds its best relief."It is now time to act with fortitude. Julius Csesar" lost an only daughter; Augustus saw his grandsons" prematurely snatched away; but their grief was in-" ward only. They bore the stroke of affliction with" silent dignity. If the authority qf ancient times"were requisite, conjunctures might be mentioned,

For this disinterested conduct the reason assignedwas, that the dignity of two such illustrious citizensdeserved to be supported. In general, it was a rulewith Tiberius, in all cases where he had no previoustitle from connexion or friendship, not to accept anyproperty as testamentary heir. When humour, ca­price, or passion induced a stranger to dismherit hiskindred, and make a disposition in favour of theprince, he declared it an inofficious testament. Tohonest and virtuous poverty he often showed himselfa friend, to prodigality he was an inflexible enemy.In the class of spendthrifts he considered VibidiusVarro, Marius Nepos, Appius Appianus, CorneliusSylla, and Quintus Vitellius. These men, undone bytheir own extravagance, were either expelled the se­nate, or allowed to vacate their seats.
XLIX. The plan undertaken by Augustus for thebuilding of temples in the room of such as had beeninjured by time, or damaged by fire, was now com­pleted. Tiberius dedicated the various structures oftheir respective deities; one near the Great Circus to' Bacchus, Proserpine, and Ceres, originally raised inconsequence of a vow made by Aulus Posthumiusthe dictator; a temple to Flora, near the same place,formerly dedicated by Lucius and Marcus Publicius,during their sedileship ; another to Janus, in the herb-market, founded by Caius Duillius, the first who bya naval victory added lustre to the Roman name, andtriumphed over the Carthaginians. The temple ofHope, vowed by Atilius in the same Punic war, wasdedicated by Germanicus.
L. Meanwhile, the law of violated majesty wenton with increasing fury. A prosecution founded onthat cruel device was set on foot against ApureiaVa-rilia, descended from a sister of Augustus, andgrand niece to that emperor. She was charged withspeaking defamatory words to the dishonour of Au-(justus, and uttering sharp invectives against Tiberiusand his mother. Adultery was another head of ac­cusation : though related to the C*sarian family, shehad, by her licentious conduct, brought disgrace onthat illustrious name. The last article was thrown

honourable wounds, atonement would then be made.Germanicus embraced the opportunity; and throwinga bridge over the river, advanced with an army oftwelve thousand legionary soldiers, six-and-twentycohorts of the allies, and eight squadrons of horse;all free from disaffection, and during the late commo­tions strict observers of discipline. ,
L. The Germans, posted at a small distance, ex­ulted in full security. They saw with pleasure thecessation of arms, occasioned by the death of Augus­tus; and the revolt of the legions inspired them withfresh courage. The Romans, by a forced march,passed the Csesian forest; and having levelled part ofthe rampart formerly begun by Tiberius, pitched theirtents on the spot. In the front and rear of the camp,they threw up intrenchments. The flanks were for­tified with a pile of trees, hewn down for the pur­pose. Their way from that place lay through agloomy forest: but of two roads, which was most eli­gible, was matter of doubt; 'whether the shortest andmost frequented, or another more difficult, and sel­dom attempted, but for that,reason unsuspected bythe enemy. The longest road was preferred. Thearmy pushed on with vigour. The scouts had broughtintelligence that the approaehing night was a festival,to be celebrated by the barbarians with joy and re­velry. In consequence of this information, Csecinahad orders to advance with the light cohorts, andclear a passage through the woods. The legions fol­lowed at a moderate distance. The brightness ofthe night favoured their design. They arrived, withrapid expedition, at the villages of the Marsians, andwithout delay formed a chain of posts, to inclose theenemy on every side. The barbarians were sunk insleep and wine, some stretched on the beds, others atfull length under the tables; all in full security, with­out a guard, without posts, and without a sentinel onduty. No appearance of war was seen; nor couldthat be called a peace, which was only the effect ofsavage riot, the languor of a debauch.

denee of Tiberius, he had beforehand disclosed thenature of his business. The emperor refused to grantan interview, and yet encouraged the informer, wil­ling through the same channel to receive further in­telligence. Libo in the mean time was raised to thedignity of prsefor. He was a frequent guest at theimperial table. In those convivial moments, Tiberiusnever betrayed a symptom of suspicion. With gentleexpressions, and looks of kindness, that master ofdissimulation knew how to hide the malice of hisheart. The follies of Libo's conduct might have beenchecked in the beginning; but Tiberius chose to col­lect materials for a future day. It happened at lastthat one Junius, who pretended to raise the dead bymagic incantations, was appointed, at the request ofLibo, to exhibit the wonders of his art. This manhastened with the secret to Fulcinius Trio, at thattime a noted informer, who possessed dangerous ta­lents, and by any arts, however pernicious, wished toraiso himself into public notice. Libo was cited toappear. Trio applied to the consuls for a solemnhearing before the senate. The fathers were convenedto deliberate, as the summons informed them, onmatters of moment, and a charge of the blackest na­ture.
XXIX. Libo changed his dress. In a mourninggarb he went from house to house, attended by a fe­male train of the first distinction. He importuned hisfriends, and among them hoped to find some onewilling to undertake his defence. His application waswithout effect. His friends deserted him, with differ­ent excuses; but all from the common motive of fear.On the day of trial, sinking under his distress, andfaint with real or pretended illness, he was carried ina litter to the senate-house. He entered the court,supported by his brother. At the sight of the empe­ror, he stretched forth his hands in the manner of asupplicant, and in a pathetic tone endeavoured toconciliate favour. Tiberius viewed him with,a rigidand inflexible countenance. He then proceeded toopen the charge, stating the particulars, and the names

soldiers, ran wild through the camp, trampling downall that came in his way. This accident spread a ge­neral panic. In the first hurry of surprise, it was ge­nerally believed that the Germans had stormed theintrenchments. The soldiers rushed to the gates,chiefly to that called the Decuman, at the back ofthe camp, remote from, the enemy, and the most like­ly to favour their escape. Csecina knew that it wasa false alarm; he tried to recal the men from theirerror: he commanded, he implored, he laid hold ofnumbers; but finding all without effect, he threwhimself on the ground, and lay stretched at lengthacross the passage. At the sight of their general inthat condition, the men recoiled with horror from theoutrage of trampling on his body. In that interval,the tribunes and centurions convinced the men thattheir fears were without foundation.
LXVII. Csecina assembled his men in the part ofthe camp assigned for the eagles. Having commandedsilence, he explained their situation, and the necessi­ty that called upon them to act like men. " They had"nothing to depend upon except their valour; but" their valour must be cool, deliberate, guided by pru-" dence. Let all remain within the lines, till the bar-" barians, in hopes of carrying the works, advance to" the assault. Then will be the time to sally out. ByM one brave effort they might open a passage to the" Rhine. If they fled, other woods, and deeper fens," remain behind; perhaps more savage enemies. By"one glorious victory they were sure of gaining"every advantage; honoured by their country, loved" by their families, and applauded by the whole" army." The bright side of the military life beingthus held forth, he said nothing of the reverse. Hisnext care was to select a body of his bravest soldiers.These he provided with horses, as well from his ownretinue, as from those of the tribunes and centurions,without favour or partiality, distinguishing merit only.The men thus mounted were to make the first im­pression on the en^§y, and the infantry had orders tosupport the rear.

" lord it over them with pride and arrogance. By the" murder of Germanicus, disaffection was diffused" among the legions, and the opportunity to strike the" blow for liberty was now arrived. Reflect on the" numbers we can bring into the field : remember the" impoverished state of Italy. At Rome every war-" like principle is extinguished. The strength of their" armies is mouldered away. They have no national" strength, but depend altogether on foreign nations" to fight their battles."
XLI. A general spirit of revolt prevailed in everypart of Gaul. Scarce a city was free from commo­tion. The flame blazed out among the Andecaviansand the people of Tours ; but by the diligence ofAcilius Aviola, who marched from Lyons at the headof a cohort, the insurgents in the former provincewere reduced to obedience. The same commander,with a legionary force, detached by Visellius Varro,from the Lower Germany, marched into the territoryof Tours, and quelled the insurrection. In this ex­pedition some of the principal chiefs in Gaul joinedthe Roman army, not with zeal for the cause, butpretending friendship, in order, with surer effect, tobe traitors in the end. Even Sacrovir fought withthe Romans: he was seen in the heat of action withhis head uncovered, in order, as he gave out, to sig­nalize his courage and fidelity: but in truth, as wasafterwards collected from the prisoners, to avoid be­ing aimed at by the darts of his countrymen. Anaccount of these disturbances was transmitted to Ti­berius. He doubted the intelligence, and by his in­decision prolonged the war.
XLII. Julius Florus, in the mean time, continuedto exert his most vigorous efforts. A regiment ofhorse, raised formerly among the Treveri, but train­ed to the Roman discipline, happened to be quarteredat Treves. He tampered with those troops, in hopesof beginning the war by a general massacre of theRoman merchants. A small number listened to hisadvice, but the rest continued in their duty. Floruswas followed by a rabble of debtors, and a number ofhis own dependants. He marched towards the forest

LXIII. Several other cities appeared by their de­puties; but the senate, weary of the number, and ofthe party-spirit, with which different places wereespoused, came to a resolution, to refer the wholeto the consuls, and wait their report on the merits ofeach distinctive case. The consuls went throughthe inquiry. Besides the temples already mentioned,they found at Pergamos the sanctuary of iEsculapius,. confirmed by authentic proof. The titles of otherplaces, being all deduced from ages too remote, werelost in the darkness of antiquity. In this numberwas the oracle of Apollo, by which it was pretended,that the people of Smyrna were commanded to builda temple to Venus Stratonice; and another of thesame god, directing a temple and a statue to Nep­tune, in the isle of Tenos. The Sardians, and thepeople of Miletus, were content with a more moderndate. The former relied on the privileges grantedby Alexander; and the latter, on the authority ofDarius. Diana was the tutelar deity in one of thosecities, and Apollo in the other. The statue of Au­gustus was held to be a sanctuary by the inhabitantsof Crete. Several decrees were passed, with due at­tention to the religious tenets of the people, yetlimiting the number of sanctuaries. These regula­tions were ordered to be engraved in brass, and fixedup in the respective temples, as lasting monuments,to ascertain the rights now established, and preventthe future claims of national pride, or Blind super­stition.
LXIV. About this time a fit of illness threatenedthe life of Livia. Her danger was so alarming, thatit occasioned the emperor's return to Rome. Hithertothe mother and son had lived on terms of mutualregard, or, at worst, with hatred well disguised. Li­via, not long before, had raised a statue to Augustus,near1 the theatre of Marcellus. In the votive inscrip­tion her own name preceded that of the emperor. To.the jealous temper of Tiberius this was an offenceagainst the imperial dignity. His resentment, how­ever, was suppressed, and for that reason, was thoughtto haTe sunk the deeper. The senate proceeded!" 1

peror could prejudge the cause : the guilt or the in­nocence of men must arise out of the facts. He add­ed, that Rhescuporis would do well to release hisnephew^ and make the best of his way to Rome, inorder to fix the criminality where it ought to fall. Aletter to this effect from the emperor was forwarded tothe Thracian king of Latinius Pandus, prsetor of My-sia. A band of soldiers went at the same time, todemand that Cotys should be delivered into their cus­tody. Rhescuporis, divided between hope and fear,fluctuated for some time : he choose, at length, ratherto answer for an actual crime, than for the bare inten­tion. He murdered Cotys, and spread a report thathe died by his own hand. Tiberius heard the newswithout emotion, determined still to pursue his planof fraud and treachery. Latinius Pandus died in theinterval. Rhescuporis had always represented himas his inveterate enemy, but the government of Mysiabeing now vacant, Tiberius gave the administrationof the province to Pomponius Flaccus, a man of mili­tary experience, and upon the best terms with Rhes-i cuporis. A friend, he knew, might prove in the endthe most fatal enemy. That consideration determinedlis choice.
LXVII. Flaccus, without loss of time, arrived inThrace. He found Rhescuporis in a,state of violentagitation, conscious of his guilt, and overwhelmedwith doubt and fear. He soothed him with graciouswords, and by plausible promises inveigled him tohazard his person within the lines of a Roman garri­son. Pretending there to do honour to the prince, heappointed a guard to attend him. The tribunes andcenturions enticed him to go forward under their pro­tection; till having drawn him a considerable way,they avowed their purpose, and Rhescuporis foundthat he was a prisoner in close custody. Ho wasconducted to Rome, where the widow of Cotys ac­cused him before the senate.

auxiliary forces to Bail down the Rhine, in order, ifthe mutiny still subsisted, to crush it at once by forceof arms.
XLVI. At Rome, in the mean time, where theissue of the commotions in Illyricum was yet unknown,advice was received of the disorders that broke outin Germany. The city was thrown into consterna­tion. All exclaimed against the conduct of Tiberius." To amuse the senate and the people, both helpless," void of spirit, and disarmed, was the sole drift of" the emperor. The flame of discord was in the mean"time kindled up by the distant armies; and two"young men who had neither experience, nor sufli-" cient authority, were sent in vain to quell the insur-'.' rection. Why did not Tiberius set out in person"upon the first alarm? The occasion called for his" presence. At sight of him, who had gained renown" in war, and was moreover the fountain of rewards" and punishments, the malcontents would have laid" down their arms. Augustus, though in the decline"of life, could make a progress into Germany; and" shall Tiberius, in the vigour of his days, content" himself with the vain parade of attending the senate," there to amuse himself with petty disputes, to cavil" about words, and wrangle with the fathers? Enough" was done at Rome to establish his system of slavery," and despotic power. Measures should now be taken" to curb the spirit of the legions, and teach them to" endure the leisure of repose."
XLVII. Tiberius heard the murmurs of discontent,but remained inflexible. To keep possession of thecapital, and neither hazard his own safety, nor thatof the empire, was his fixed resolution. A crowd ofreflections filled him with anxiety. The German armywas superior in strength; that in Pannonia was thenearest: the former had great resources in Gaul, andItaly lay open to the latter. To which should he givethe preference ? If he visited one, the other mighttake umbrage. By sending his sons, he held the ba­lance even, and neither could be jealous. It was be­sides his maxim, that the imperial dignity should not

"his solicitude by tumult and insurrection? If they" would still persist in the season of profound peace," to urge ,a claim never demanded even by the con-" querors in a civil war, why incur the guilt of rebel­lion ? why, in violation of all military discipline," urge their pretensions sword in hand? They might" depute their agents to treat with the prince; and, in" the presence of their general, they might give their" instructions on the spot." This proposal was ac­cepted ; with one voice they called out for the son ofBIebsus, then a military tribune. The young officerundertook the charge. His directions were to insistthat, at the expiration of sixteen years, the soldiershould be discharged from the service. That pointsettled, it would then be time to enumerate othergrievances. With this commission the general's sonwent forward on his journey. A calm succeeded, andlasted for some days. But the minds of the soldierswere still in agitation: their pride was roused; the ge­neral's son was now the orator of the army; and force,it was manifest, had at length extorted, what by gen­tle measures could never be obtained.
XX. Meanwhile, the detached companies which be­fore the disturbance had been sent to Nauportum torepair the roads, the bridges, and other military works,having heard of the commotions in the camp, seizedthe colours ; and, after ravaging the adjacent villages,plundered Nauportum, a place little inferior to a mu­nicipal town. They treated the centurions with de­rision; from derision they proceeded to opprobriouslanguage; and, in the end, to blows and open violence.Aufidenus Rufus, the prefect of the camp, was thechief object of their fury : they dragged him out of hiscarriage; and, laying a heavy load on his back,obliged him to march in the foremost ranks, askinghim with contemptuous insolence how he liked hisburden, and the length of his journey ? Rufus hadrisen from a common man to the rank of centurion,and was afterwards made prsefect of the camp. Inthat station he endeavoured to recall the rigour ofancient discipline.

Piso formed them into com­panies ; he armed the lowest followers of the army,and with this hasty levy embarked for the continent.He had not long been landed, when a body of recruits,marching to the legions in Syria, fell in his way. Hedrew them over to his party, and by circular lettersdemanded succours from the petty kings of Cilicia.The younger Pisb, though he had objected to themeasure, was not inactive in his father's service.

Both par­ties were eager to come to action; but they passedeach other, content with throwing out reproaches andopprobrious language.

Pisoanswered with derision, " that he would be sure to" attend, when the prsetor, vested with jurisdiction in" matters of poison, had cited the parties, and ap-" pointed a day." Meanwhile Domitius, who had land­ed at Laodicea, in the province of Syria, advancedtowards the winter-quarters of the sixth legion; expect­ing in that corps, to find the minds of the men ripe formutiny and desertion. By the vigilance of Pacuvius,who commanded in those parts, the attempt was frus­trated. Sentius, by letters to Piso, complained ofthese proceedings; at the same time warning him nei­ther to corrupt the army nor disturb the peace of theprovince. His next care was to draught from the le­gions all such soldiers as were known to be attachedto Germanicus, or adverse to his enemies! He repre­sented the attempts of Piso, as an invasion of the im­perial dignity, and a war against the commonwealth.Having excited the ardour of his men, he, marchedinto Cilicia, prepared to decide the dispute by forceof arms.

own rank, he was determined to act with the strictestself-denial. This had the appearance of moderation,but envy was the source. By the honours intendedto his mother, he thought his own glory might boeclipsed, and, in that spirit, prevented a decree, bywhich a lictor was ordered to attend her; nor wouldhe suffer an altar to be raised on account of her adop­tion into the Julian family. Other marks of distinc­tion were proposed, and rejected. Germanicus waamore favourably treated: for him Tiberius desiredthe rank of proconsul. Special messengers were sentto invest him with his honours, and at the same timeto condole with him on the loss of Augustus. Drusuawas then at Rome; and, being consul designed, in hisfavour nothing new was demanded. By virtue of theimperial prerogative, twelve candidates were namedfor the prsetorship. That number had been settled byAugustus; and though the senate entreated Tiberiusto enlarge the lis), he bound himself by an oath neverto exceed the line already drawn.
XV. The right of electing magistrates, by publicsuffrage, in the Field of Mars, was now, for the firsttime, taken from the people at large, and vested inthe senate. The will of the prince had, before thattime, great influence in all elections; but parties wereformed among the tribes, and sometimes with success.To this encroachment the people made no opposition :they saw their rights taken from them ; they grumbledand submitted. The senators were pleased with thechange. They were now delivered from the necessi­ty of humiliating condescensions in the course of theircanvass, and from the heavy expense of bribery andcorruption. The moderation of Tiberius was a furthercircumstance in favour of the measure; four candi­dates of his nomination were implicitly to be chosen,without intrigue or contention; and the prince, con­tent with that number, promised not to stretch hisprerogative. The tribunes of the people applied forleave to celebrate, at their own expense, the gamesnewly instituted in honour of Augustus, and orderedto be added to the calendar, under the title of the Au­gustan Games.

The" enemy is not at the gates of Rome, and the pro-" vinces have no hostile intentions. In favour of the" tender sex some concessions ought to be made," especially since it is now known by experience that" the wife, so far from being a burden to the province," is scarcely felt in the private economy of the hus-" band. She is no more than a sharer in his splen-" dour and dignity. In time of peace what danger" from her presence ? War, indeed, calls for vigour;" and men should go unencumbered to the field." When the campaign is over, where can the general" so well repose from toil and labour as in the bosom" of a wife, whose tenderness relieves his pain, and" sweetens every care ? But woman, it has been said," are prone to avarice and ambition; what shall be" said of the magistrates? Have they always been" free from irregular passions ? and if not, will it fol-4' low that men are to be no longer trusted with the" administration of the provinces ?

he seduced the affections of Julia, even in the lifetimeof her husband Agrippa. Nor did his passions stopthere: when she was afterwards married to Tiberius,he was still a persevering adulterer, and by secret ar­tifices poisoned the mind of the wife against her hus­band. The letter to Augustus, in which she treatedthe character of Tiberius with contempt, was general­ly thought to be his composition. For these offences hewas banished toCercina,an island on the coast of Afri­ca, where he passed fourteen years in exile. Soldiersat length were sent to put an end to his days. Theassassins found him on the point of a prominent neckof land, with a countenance fixed in sorrow and de­spair. As soon as the ruffians approached, he desireda short delay, that he might write the sentiments of adying man to his wife Alliaria. Having despatchedthat business, he presented his neck to the murderers'stroke: in his last moments worthy of the Sempro-nian name. His life was a series of degenerate actions.The assassins, according to some historians, were nothired at Rome, but sent from Africa by the proconsulLucius Asprenas, at the instigation of Tiberius, whohoped to throw from himself the load of guilt, and fixit on his tools of power. The artifice did not suc­ceed.
LIV. In the course of this year was formed a newinstitution of religious rites. In honour of Augustusa, list of priests was added to the sacerdotal college,in imitation of the order founded in ancient timesby Titus Tatius, to perpetuate the religious ceremo­nies of the Sabines. To create this new sodality, thenames of the most eminent citizens, to the number ofone-and-twenty, were drawn by lot; and Tiberiu?,Drusus, Claudius, and Germanicus were added. Ithappened, however, that the games performed thisyear in honour of Augustus, were disturbed by vio­lent factions among the players. In compliance withthe wishes of Mecenas, that passionate admirer of.Bathyllus the comedian, Augustus had always fa­voured the exhibition of pantomimes. He had himselfa taste for those amusements; and by mixing with thediversions of the multitude, he thought he showed aVol. I.—E

If Drususand Germanicus reserved some points for the consi­deration of their father, the inexperience of youthwould be a sufficient apology. Should the mutineerspersist with obstinacy, there would still be time forthe prince to interpose, and either by rigour, or con­ciliating measures, to restore the ancient discipline.If he went in person, and the insurgents spurned hisauthority, what resource was left?—These considera­tions had their weight; and yet, to have the appear­ance of being willing to face his armies was part of.his policy. He played this game so well, that heseemed every day upon the point of leaving Rome.He settled his train of attendants, ordered his campequipage, equipped his fleets; still contriving, byspecious pretences, to give a colour to delay. Thewinter season, he said, was near at hand, and theweight of affairs at Rome claimed his attention. Themost discerning were for some time the dupes of hisdissimulation. The people were much longer amused,

XLVIH. Germanicus in the mean time was ready,with his collected force, to act against the rebel le­gions. He was willing, notwithstanding, to suspend'his operations, till time should show whether the lateexample had wrought the minds of the soldiers tosubmission, and a due sense of their duty. With this,intent, he sent despatches to Carina, to inform thatofficer, that he was advancing at the head of a power­ful army; resolved, if justice was not previously exe­cuted, to put the whole body to the sword. Cojcinacommunicated, in a confidential manner, his secretinstructions to the standard-bearers, to the inferior of­ficers, and such of the private men as were known tobe well affected. He recommended to them to avertthe danger that hung over the legions, and in goodtime to secure their lives.

4 jest ? In the juncture before us, Claudius figured. so little on the stage of public business, that therewas scarce a man in Rome, who did not seem, by the/ voice of fame and the wishes of the people, designedfor the sovereign power, rather than the very person,whom fate, in that instant, cherished in obscurity, tomake him, at a future period, master of the Romanworld.
XIX. The senate, a few days afterwards, on themotion of Tiberius, granted the sacerdotal dignity toVitellius, Veranius, and Servseus. Fulcinius Trioreceived a promise of the emperor's favour in hisroad to honours, but was at the same,time admo­nished to restrain the ardour of his genius, lest, byover-heated vehemence, he might mar his eloquence.In this manner ended the inquiry concerning thedeath of Germanicus; a subject which has been va­riously represented, not only by men of that day,but by all subsequent writers. It remains, to thishour, the problem of history. A cloud forever hangsover the most important transactions, while, on theone hand, credulity adopts for fact the report of theday; and, on the other, politicians warp and disguisethe truth: between both parties two different accountsgo down from age to age, and gain strength with pos­terity.
Drusus thought it time to enjoy the honours of apublic entry. For this purpose he went out of thecity, and having assisted at the ceremony of the au­spices, returned with the splendour of an ovation. Ina few days after he lost his mother Vipsania; of allthe children of Agrippa, the only one that died a na­tural death. The rest were brought to a tragic end;some, as is well known, by the murderer's stroke;and others, as is generally believed, by poison or byfamine.
XX. In the same year Tacfarinas, the Numidianchief, whom we have seen defeated by Camillus in aformer campaign, once more commenced hostilities inAfrica. He began by sudden incursions; dependingfor his safety on the rapidity of his flight. Embold­ened by success, he attacked several towns and vil­

demagogue. Among the deputies sent to Germani-cus, was Segimund, the son of Segestes; a youngman who, in the year famous for the revolt of Ger­many, was made by the Romans a priest of thoUbian altar; but soon after, fired by the zeal thatroused his whole nation, he tore off his sacred vest­ments, and went over to his countrymen. Consciousof this offence, he hesitated for some time, willing todecline the embassy; till at length, encouraged'by thefame of Roman clemency, he obeyed his father's or­ders. He met with a gracious reception; and, undera proper guard, was conducted in safety to the fron­tiers of Gaul. Germanicus thought it of moment tochange his purpose, and marched back to the relief ofSegestes. He no sooner appeared-before the place," than the enemy was attacked and put to the rout.Segestes was set at liberty, and with him a nu­merous train of relatives and faithful followers;several women of noble birth; and, in the number,the daughter of Segestes, then married to Arminius.In her deportment no trace appeared of her father'scharacter: she breathed the spirit of her husband.Not a tear was seen to start; no supplicating tonewas heard; she stood in pensive silence; her handsstrained close to her bosom, and her eyes fixed uponher womb, then pregnant with the fruit of her mar­riage. At the same time was brought forth a load ofspoils, which, in the slaughter of Varus and his le­gions, fell to the share of those who now surrenderedto the Roman arms. What chiefly attracted everyeye, was Segestes himself; his stature of superior size,and his countenance that of a man who knew neitherguilt nor fear. He spoke to this effect:
LVIII. " It is not now the first time that Segestes"has given proofs'of his attachment to the cause of" Rome. From the moment when I was enrolled a"citizen by the deified Augustus, your interest has'" been the rule of my conduct. Your friends I em-" braced; your enemies were mine. In acting thus, I" have not been guilty of treason to my country. A" traitor I know is odious, even to those who profit by" the treason. I have been your friend, because I

said, " or to decline any part, would ill become the" man who wished to be dispensed with altogether."Gallus saw displeasure working in his countenance.With quickness and presence of mind he made an­swer, " The question was not put with intent to di-" vide what in its nature is united and indivisible. I" appealed to your own feelings. I wished to draw" from you a confession, that the commonwealth, be-" ing one body politic, requires one mind to direct" it." To this he added a panegyric on the charac­ter of Augustus; he expatiated on the victories ob­tained by Tiberius, and the civil employments whichhe had filled, with honour to himself, during a seriesof years. But this soothing strain had no effect. Theresentment of Tiberius was not to be pacified.Asinius Gallus had married Vipsania, the daughterof Marcus Agrippa, after her divorce from Tiberius.By that connexion he seemed to aspire above therank of a citizen; and the spirit of his father, AsiniusPollio, was still living in the son.
XIII. Lucius Arruntius delivered his sentiments,nearly the same as Gallus had offered, and in likemanner gave offence. Tiberius harboured in hisbreast no lurking sentiment to Arruntius; but hewas jealous of a man, whom he saw flourishing inopulence, an ardent spirit, possessed of talents, andhigh in the esteem of the public. Augustus, more­over, in a conversation not long before his death,talking of the succession to the imperial dignity, dis­tinguished three several classes; in the first, he placedsuch as were worthy, but would decline the honour;in the se'cond, men of ambition, but of inferior talents;in the last, such as had genius to plan, and courageto undertake. Marcus Lcpidus, he said, was everyway qualified, but unwilling; Asinius Gallus hadmore ambition than merit; Lucius Arruntius was notonly equal to the task, but, if occasion oft'ered, wouldshow a spirit of enterprise. Of this anecdote, withregard to the two first, no doubt remains; but insteadof Arruntius, Cneius Piso, by some writers, is said tohave been named. Except Lepidus, they were after­wards all cut off for constructive crimes, artfully laid

of such liberal donations, struck the minds of menwith so much wonder, as the high tone with whichhe rejected the application of Marcus Hortalus, ayoung man of distinction, but embarrassed in his cir­cumstances. He was grandson to Hortensius, the cele­brated orator. To prevent the extinction of that il­lustrious family, Augustus pressed him to marry, andseconded his advice by a present of a thousand greatsesterces. The senate was sitting in the emperor'spalace: Hortalus attended. Having stationed his fourchildren before the door, he rose in his place, direct­ing his eyes, first to the statue of Hortensius, amongthe famous orators, then to the statue of Augustus,and spoke to the following effect: " My children, con­script fathers, are now before you: you see their" number, and their helpless infancy. They were not" mine by choice: the command of Augustus made" me a father. Let me add, the merit of my ances." tors stood in so distinguished a light, that the line" ought not to fail for want of issue. As to myself, the" distraction of the times left me nothing but difficul-"ties: involved in distress, destitute, without popular" favour, and, above all, not endowed with eloquence," that peculiar gift and fortune of my family, I could" have passed my days in humble content, resolved" that poverty should neither make" me a disgrace te"my ancestors, nor a burthen to my friends. The" advice of Augustus was a command: I obeyed, and" married. Behold the issue of that alliance, the pos," terity of consuls and dictators. It is not the language" of vain glory that I utter; it is the voice of a father" pleading for his children. Receive them, Csesar,"to your protection: under your auspicious smiles" they may live to deserve your favour, and to merit" public honours. In the mean time, let their tender" years claim compassion: they are the grandchildren" of Hortensius, and they were fostered by Augustus."
XXXVIII. This speech made an impression in hisfavour: but the inclination of the senate was sufficientto sour a temper like that of Tiberius. He replied teHortalus nearly in the following words: "If the trade" of begging is to be encouraged ( if the poor are te

place, than the enemy raised the siege, and,consultedtheir safety by flight. It was found, however, thatthey had levelled to the ground the monument erect­ed the year before to Varus and his legions, and like­wise an ancient altar dedicated to Drusus. Theprince rebuilt the altar; and joined with the legionsin equestrian games, performed a funeral ceremonyin honour of his father. He did not judge it advisa­ble to restore the tomb, which had been erected toVarus and the legions; but, with a chain of fortifiedposts, he secured the whole country between FortAliso and the Rhine.
,VIII. The fleet assembled at the place appointed.Germanicus ordered the military stores to bo sent onboard; and, having completed the embarkation ofthe legions and the allies, sailed through the canalcalled the canal of Drusus, invoking his father toassist the enterprise, and by the memory of his ex­ample to guide and animate his son, now pursuing thesame track of glory. The fleet proceeded over thelakes; and, entering the German Ocean, stretchedaway as far as the river Amisia. There, at a placeof the same name on the left hand shore, he landedhis men, leaving his ships safe at their moorings.This measure was ill concerted. The debarkationshould have been made higher up the country, andon the opposite bank, where the enemy had takenpost. The mistake made it necessary to throw bridgesover the river, and in that business several days wereconsumed. At low water the cavalry and the legionsforded over the lestuary without difficulty; but therear, consisting of the auxiliary forces, was over­thrown by the return of the tide, and thrown intodisorder. The Batavians, in particular, eager toshow their dexterity in swimming, continued sportingin the waves till the rapidity of, the current over­whelmed them. Some lost their lives. Germanicuspitched his camp. While he was employed in mark­ing out the lines, he received advice that the Angri-varians, whom he had left behind him were in mo­tion.

by the sword, if Stertinius had not checked the im­petuosity of Flavius, who stood burning with resent­ment, and calling aloud for his horse and arms. Ar-minius behaved with equal fury, in his slorm ofpassion denouncing vengeance, and threatening* theissue of a battle. What he said was perfectly under­stood. He had commanded the auxiliaries of his coun­try, acting in conjunction with the legions, and, hav ingconversed in the Roman camp, was able to interlardhis discourse with Latin expressions.
XI. On the following day, the Germans appearedon the other side of the Visurgis, drawn up in orderof battle. Germanicus, till he had thrown bridges overthe river, and made each pass secure, did not thinkit advisable to expose his legions to the hazard of anongagement. In the mean time, to cause a diversionof the enemy, he ordered the cavalry, under the con­duct of Stertinius, and jEmilius, one of the principalcenturions, to ford over at two different places. Ca-riovalda, at the head of his Batavians, advancedwhere the current was most rapid. The Cheruscansfeigned a flight. Cariovalda, pursuing with too mucheagerness, pushed on to a place encompassed withwoods, and fell into an ambuscade. The enemyrushed onto the attack with impetuous fury. Theybore down all who resisted, and pressed on such asgave way. The Batavians formed a ring, and weresurrounded on every side. The Germans, at a dis­tance, discharged a volley of darts, while some ofthem, more eager than the rest, fought hand to handin close engagement. Cariovalda sustained the shockwith undaunted valour. Finding himself, at length,in danger of being overpowered, he exhorted his mento form in platoons, and bravely opened a passagethrough the ranks of the enemy. He rushed forwardinto the heat of the action; but his horse being killed,he fell under a shower of darts, and died sword inhand. Several of the prime nobility of his countryperished with him. The rest found their safety ei­ther in their own valour or the timely succour ofStertinius aud iEniilhis, who came up with the cavalry.

" subdued the nations between the Rhine and the"Elbe, dedicates this monument to Mars, to Jupiter," and Augustus." Of the commander in chief nomention was made. To soften envy, he assumed nopart of the praise, content with deserving it. Sterti-nius marched into the territory of the Angrivarians,with orders, if they did not submit, to lay the countrywaste. The barbarians surrendered at discretion, andreceived a general pardon.
XXIII. The summer being now far advanced, Ger-manicus ordered some of the legions to return by landto winter quarters; he himself sailed with the rest,down the river Amisia to the main ocean. The wea­ther was favourable, and the sea presented a perfeetcalm, unruffled by any motion except what was oc­casioned by the dashing of the oars, and the rapidmotion of a thousand vessels under sail. But this se­renity did not last long: the sky was overcast; a stormof hail burst down with sudden fury; squalls of winddrove the billows different ways, and the pilot couldno longer see what course to steer. Unused to thotempestuous element, and terrified by the novelty ofthe danger, the soldiers added to the alarm. Theyinterfered with the mariners; they endeavoured tolend a helping hand ; but activity, without skill, serv­ed only to embarrass such as knew their duty. Thewinds at last were collected to one point, and thostorm blew directly from tho south.

duty, expecting from others what he had practisedhimself.
XXI. The return of this tumultuous body renewed sthe troubles of the camp. The soldiers, without con­trol, issued out of the lines and pillaged the countryround. Some, more heavily loaded with booty thantheir comrades, were apprehended by the orders ofBlesus; and after receiving due. correction, thrown
.4o prison, as an example to the rest. The authoritythe general was still in force with the centurions,Lnd such of the common men as retained a sense oftheir duty. The delinquents, however, refused to sub­mit ; they were dragged along, resisting with all theirstrength; they clasped the knees of the multituderound them; they called upon their fellow soldiers byname; they implored the protection of the companyto which they belonged; they invoked the cohorts andthe legions, crying out to all, that the same lot wouldshortly be their portion. Against their general theyomitted nothing that calumny could suggest; theyappealed to heaven; they implored the gods; theytried, by every topic, to excite compassion, to inflameresentment, to awaken terror, and rouse the men toacts of violence. A general insurrection followed: thesoldiers in a body rushed to the prison, burst thegates, unchained the prisoners, and associated withthemselves the vilest of the army, a band of deserters,and a desperate crew of malefactors, then under con­demnation for the enormity of their crimes.
XXII. The flame of discord raged with redoubledfury. New leaders joined the mutiny. Amidst thecrowd, one of the common soldiers, a fellow knownby the name of Vibulenus, mounted on the shouldersof his comrades before the tribunal of Blesus, andaddressed the multitude, all wild with fury, and eagerto hear the language of sedition. " My friends," saidhe," you have bravely interposed to save the lives" of these innocent, these much injured men. You" have restored them to new life.

mented that by their crimes they had called downupon themselves the indignation of the gods. Rrususlook advantage of the moment. The opportunity wasthe effect of chance; but, rightly managed, mightconduce to the wisest purpose.
He gave orders that the men who by honest meanswere most in credit with the malcontents, should goround from tent to tent. Among these was Clemens,the centurion. They visited every part of the camp;they applied to the guards on duty; they conversedwith the patrole, and mixed with the sentinels at thegates. They allured some by promises, and by ter­ror subdued the spirit of others. "How long shall" we besiege the son of the emperor? Where will this"confusion end? Must we follow Percennius and Vi-" bulenus ? And shall we swear fidelity to those new"commanders? Will their funds supply the pay of"the legions? Have they lands to assign to the vete-" ran soldier? For them shall the Neros and the"Drusi be deposed? Are they to mount the vacant" throne, the future sovereigns of Rome ? Let us," since we were the last to enter into rebellion, be the"first to expiate our guilt by well-timed repentance." Demands in favour of all, proceed but slowly; to" individuals, indulgence is more easily granted; de-" serve it separately, and the reward will follow."This reasoning had its effect: suspicion and mutualdistrust began to take place; the new raised soldierswent apart from the veterans; the legions separated ;a sense of duty revived in the breast of all; the gateswere no longer guarded; and the colours, at first pro­miscuously crowded together, were restored to theirproper station.
XXIX. At the return of day, Drusus called an as­sembly of the soldiers. Though unused to publicspeaking, he delivered himself with the eloquence ofa man who felt his own importance, and the dignityof his rank. He condemned the past, and applaudedthe present. It was not, he said, a part of his charac­ter to yield to menaces, or to shrink from danger.

gathering in the East. Commotions in that part ofthe world might furnish an opportunity to remoTeGermanicus from an nrmy devoted to his person,and to employ him in new scenes of action, and indistant provinces, where he could be exposed to thechance of war, and more within the reach of treache­ry. Germanicus, meanwhile, finding the legions zeal­ous in his service, and the malice of Tiberius stillimplacable, began to consider how he might strike adecisive blow, and by one signal victory conclude thewar. For this purpose he reviewed his operations inthe three last campaigns, with the various turns ofgood and evil fortune which he had experienced. Heobserved that " the Germans, in a pitched battle, or" on equal ground, were always defeated ; woods and" fens protected them ; and the shortness of the sum." mer, with the quick return of winter, favoured their" cause. It was not so much the sword of the enemy," as the fatigue of long and difficult marches, that" thinned the Roman army. The loss of military" weapons was an additional evil. Horses were not"to be procured in Gaul, that country being well" nigh exhausted. The baggage of the army, liable" to ambuscades, was always defended at great dis-" advantage. An expedition by sea promised better" success. The army might penetrate at once into" the heart of the country; and the Germans, unap-" prised of that mode of attack, would be taken, by" surprise. The campaign would be sooner opened ;" the legions and their provisions might advance to-" gether; men and horses would arrive in good con-tt dition: and, with the advantage of harbours for" the fleet, and navigable rivers up the country, the" war might be pushed to the very heart of Ger-" many."
VL This plan of operations being judged the best,he sent Publius Vitellius and Caius Cantius to con­vene the states of Gaul; and, in the mean time,committed the caro of building a fleet to Silius,Antcius, and Csecina. A thousand vessels (that num­ber being deemed sufficient) were soon in readiness,buV not all constructed on one uniform principle.

ditious: but war knows no distinction of cases; theinnocent and the guilty fall in one promiscuous car­nage.
The officers, thus instructed, sounded the commonmen; and finding thegreatcst partwell affected,agreed,at an hour approved of by Csecina, to fall with suddenfury upon the leaders of the mutiny. Having con­certed their measures, at a signal given they beganthe attack. «They rushed sword in hand into the tents,and without mercy butchered their comrades, wholittle thought they were so near their end. A dread­ful slaughter followed; no cause assigned, and no ex­planation given. Except tho authors of the measure,no man knew from what motive the assault proceeded,or where it would end.
XLIX. In the civil wars recorded in history, weno where find a scene of horror like the present. Nobattle was fought; there was no assault from an ad­verse camp :'in the same tents where the day sawthem eat their meal in peace, and the night laid themdown to rest, comrades divide against their fellows;darts and javelins are thrown with sudden fury; up­roar and confusion follow; shouts and dying groansresound throughout the camp: a scene of blood islaid; wretches expire, and the reason remains un­known. The event is left to chance. Men of worthand honour perished in the fray; for the guilty,finding themselves the devoted objects, snatched uptheir arms, and joined the better cause. Csecina re­mained a tame spectator; no officer, no tribune at­tempted to stop the wild commotion. The fury of thesoldiers had its free career; and vengeance rioted inblood, even to satiety. Germanicus in a short timeafter entered the camp. He saw a tragic spectacle;and, with tears in his eyes, called it a massacre, notan act of justice. He ordered the dead bodies to beburnt. The fury of the soldiers had not yet subsided :in the agitation of their minds they desired to be ledagainst the enemy, in order to expiate by tho bloodof the barbarians the desolation theyjiad made. Theshades of their slaughtered friends could not be other­wise appeased: when their breasts were gashed with

in allusion to the place of his coronation. About thesame time, the Cappadocians, who had been reduced Ito the form of a province, received Quintus Veraniusas their governor. The first measure of his adminis­tration was, to remit part of the taxes heretofore paidto their kings; that from so mild a beginning, thepeople might conceive a favourable idea of Romanmoderation. The Comagenians, in like manner, sub­mitted to the government of a prsetor, and QuintusServseus was appointed to the office.
LVII. In this manner tranquillity was establishedin the east. The events were important, and such asmight have given Germanicus reason to congratulatehimself; but his joy was poisoned by the repeatedhostilities and the insolence of Fiso. This man hadorders to march with a detachment of the legions intoArmenia, or, at his option, to give the command tohis son. He complied in neither instance. Theprince met him at Cyrrum, the winter quarters of thetenth legion. At that place they came to an inter­view, both with countenances adjusted to the occa- :sion. Piso with an air of intrepidity, still disdaininga superior; and Germanicus with the serenity of aman, who wished to stifle his resentment. The gen­tle qualities of his nature inclined him at all times tomoderation; but his friends, with the ulSual talent ofmen who love to make bad worse, inflamed the quar­rel. They aggravated what was true; they gavecolour to falsehood ; and omitted nothing to the disad­vantage of Piso, Plancina, and their sons.
In the presence of a few select friends, Germanicuscame to an explanation : his language was in thatmeasured style, which anger and prudence, combatingeach other, usually inspire. Piso made an arrogantapology. The meeting broke up, and both retiredwith smothered resentment. From this time Pisorarely attended the tribunals of justice: whenever heappeared in court, his countenance plainly discoveredill-will, and sullen discontent. At a banquet givenby the Nabathean king, a sudden expression fell fromhim, and betrayed his real temper. Golden crownswere presented to the company; two, for Germanicus

LVII. The senate was not taken by surprise : theemperor's intention had been foreseen, and flatterywas ready with her servile strain. Invention, not­withstanding, was at a loss for novelty. Statues weredecreed to Tiberius and his son; altars were raised tothe gods; temples were built, and triumphal archeserected, with other honours of a similar nature. Mar­cus Silanus aimed at something new. Willing, at theexpense of the consular dignity, to pay a complimentto the princes, he proposed that, in all public and pri­vate registers, the year should no longer take its datefrom the names of the consuls, but from the personsinvested with the tribunitian power. Quintus Hate-rius went still farther; he moved that the decrees ofthat day should be fixed up in the senate-house inletters of gold. His motion was treated with con­tempt and ridicule. The fathers saw with indigna­tion a superannuated senator, who, on the verge oflife, could incur present infamy, without a prospectof future wages.
LVIII. Amidst these transactions, the governmentof Africa was continued to Junius Blsesus. Theproconsulship of Asia, happening then to be vacant,was demanded by Servius Maluginensis, the priest ofJupiter. In support of his claim, he contended," that the inability of a priest, in his station, to go out" of Italy, was a vulgar error. The order to which" he belonged, differed in nothing from that of Mars44 and Romulus. If the priest of the two last were*' eligible to foreign governments, whence arose his" incapacity ? No prohibitory law was ever passed by"the people; the books of religious ceremonies are" silent on the subject. In particular cases, when the" ministers of Jupiter were detained, either by illness" or by public business, one of the pontiffs officiated" in his place. After the tragical death of Cornelius" Merula, a space of no less than seventy-six years" elapsed, without any nomination to the office: did" the interests of religion suffer in the mean time ?" During that whole period, the sacerdotal function" was suspended, without prejudice to the established"worship; and why should not his absence be ex­

"in force, and with proper assistance the mutiny" might have been crushed at once. By dismissions" from the service, by largesses, and other feeble men-" sures, the disturbances were too much encouraged." If the general set no value on his own life, why neg-" lect the safety of his infant son? Why hazard among" lawless men, who had violr.ted every sacred right," an affectionate wife, at that time far advanced in"her pregnancy? Those tender pledges were the pro-" perty of the state, and should be restored to the em-"peror and the commonwealth." Germanicus yieldedto these remonstrances; but the consent of Agrippinawas still to be obtained. Descended from Augustusshe insisted that the grand-daughter of that emperorhad not so far degenerated, as to shrink from danger.Germanicus continued to urge his request; he meltedinto tears; he clasped her in his arms; he embracedher infant son, and at length prevailed. A processionof disconsolate women moved slowly on; and withthem the wife of the commander in chief, compelledto be a wanderer, with her infant son in her arms. Aband of wretched women, driven forth from their hus­bands, attended in her train. Amongst those whomthey left behind, the scene of distress was not less af­fecting.
XLI. The camp presented a mournful spectacle.Instead of a Roman general at the head of his legions,instead of Germanicus in all the pomp and pride ofauthority, the face of things resembled a city takenby storm. Nothing was heard but shrieks and lamen­tations. The soldiers listened; they came forth fromtheir tents; they stood astonished at the sight: and," Why," they said, " wherefore those notes of sor-"row? What means that mournful spectacle? A train"of noble matrons deserted, left to themselves, aban­doned by all! no centurion, not so much as a sol-" dier, to accompany them! The wife of the general,"undistinguished in the crowd, without a guard, and" without the train of attendants suited to her rank," proceeding on her way towards the people of Treves," to seek in a foreign state that protection, which was"denied her in a Koman camp!"

Thiswas felt as an affront: the soldiers cried out with in­dignation, " The dawn of day shall see us in the" field: let Arminius risk a battle: the lands of his" countrymen shall be ours by conquest, and their" wives shall be carried off in captivity. The offer is" an omcu of victory. The wealth and the women of" Germany shall be the reward of valour." At thethird watch, the enemy advanced to the intrench­ments; but perceiving the works properly guarded,the cohorts under arms, and all intent on duty, theyretreated, without so much as throwing a single dart.
XIV. Germanicus retired to rest, and in his sleepwas favoured with a joyful vision. Being employed,as he imagined, at a sacrifice, and. the blood of thevictim happening to stain his pontifical garment, hisgrand-mother Livia made him a present of anotherrobe, no less beautiful than magnificent. Pleased withthis prognostic, which the auspices confirmed, hecalled an assembly of the soldiers, and, in a speech,acquainted them with his plan for the ensuing battle.The open plain, he observed, was not the only spotwhere the Romans could engage with advantage.Woods and forests were equally favourable. Theunwieldy buckler of the Germans, and that enormouslength of spear, which, amidst surrounding trees andinterwoven thickets, was scarcely manageable, couldnot be compared to the Roman sword, the javelin,and their defensive armour, so well adapted to theshape and motions of the body. " Redouble your" blows," he said," and strike at the face of the enemy." They have neither helmets, nor breast-plates. Their"shields are neither riveted with iron, nor covered" with hides; they are nothing but ozier twigs inter-" twined, or slight boards, daubed over with glaring" colours.

The provinces of Achaia and Macedonia, being foundunequal to the taxes imposed upon them, were re­lieved from the expense ofsupporting a proconsulargovernment, and for the present transferred to thesuperintendence of the emperor. Drusus, in his awnname, and that of his brother Germanicus, exhibiteda spectacle of gladiators, and presided in person ; de­lighted, more than became his rank, with the effusionof blood, and, by consequence, giving to the populaceno favourable impression of his character. Tibe­rius, it is said, reproved him for his indiscretion.Why he himself did not attend the public games,various reasons were assigned. According to some," numerous assemblies were not his taste, and crowds" fatigued him." Others ascribed it to the phlegmaticgenius of the man, fond of solitude, and willing toavoid a comparison with the gracious manners ofAugustus, who was always a cheerful spectator onsuch occasions. That he intended, with covered ma­lice, to afford Drusus an opportunity of laying openthe ferocity of his nature, and thereby giving umbrageto the people, seems rather a strained construction ;yet even this was said at the time.
LXXVII. The disorders occasioned by theatricalfictions in the preceding year, broke out again withincreasing fury. Numbers of the common people, andeven many of the soldiers, with their centurion, ex­erting themselves to quell the tumult, and defend themagistrate, were killed in the fray. A tribune of theprsetorian guard was wounded on the occasion. Theaffair was taken into consideration by the senate.The fathers were on the point of passing a vote, in­vesting the prsetor with authority to order the playersto be publicly whipped. This was opposed by Hate-mis Agrippa, a tribune of the people, who by hisspeech drew upon himself a sharp reply from Asi-nius Gallus. Tiberius with a deep reserve listened tothe debate.

LIX. The surrender of Segestes, and his graciousreception from Germanicus, being in a short timespread throughout Germany, the feelings of menwere various, as their inclinations happened to be forpeace or war. Arminius, by nature fierce and enter­prising, seeing, in this juncture, his wife for ever lost,and the child in her womb a slave before its birth,felt himself inflamed with tenfold fury. He flew roundthe country of the Cheruscans, spreading the flame ofdiscord, and in every quarter rousing the people torevenge; he called aloud to arms, to arms against Se­gestes, to arms against the Romans. He spared notopic that could inflame resentment. " Behold," hecried, " behold in Segestes the true character of a"father! in Germanicus an accomplished general! in" the exploits of the Roman army, the glory of a war-"like nation! with mighty numbers they have led a" woman into captivity. It was not in this manner"that Arminius dealt with them: three legions, and" as many commanders, fell a sacrifice to my revenge."To the arts of traitors I am a stranger; I wage" no war with women big with child. My enemies" are worthy of a soldier; I declare open hostility," and sword in hand I meet them in the field of bat-" tie.
" Survey your religious groves: the Roman ban-" ners by me hung up, and dedicated to the gods of" our country, are there displayed; they are the tro-" phies of victory. Let Segestes fly for shelter to"the Roman provinces; let him enjoy his bank on"the side of Gaul; and let him there meanly crouch" to make his son the priest of a foreign altar.

they repented of their choice, and saw, with regTet,the disgrace which their tame submission had brought:upon their country. "The Parthians," they said," were a degenerate race, who meanly stooped to sue i" in another world, and invited to reign over them an |" exotic king, trained up by the Romans, fraught with" their maxims, and tainted by their manners. The" kingdom of the Arsacides was at length reduced to" a Roman province, to be dealt out at the pleasure" of the emperor. Where now the glory of those" gallant heroes who put Crassus to death, and made" Marc Antony fly before them? The slave of Ccesar," who crouched so many years in bondage, gives the" law to the Parthians." Such were the prejudicesof the people. The conduct of Vonones inflamed theirindignation. He renounced the manners of his coun­try ; was rarely seen in the sports of the chase ; hetook'no delight in horsemanship, and in his progressthrough the kingdom lolled at ease in a litter. Hedisdained, with fastidious pride, to have his tableserved agreeably to the national taste; his train ofGreek attendants gave disgust; and the paltry atten­tion, that secured the most trifling articles under aseal, excited the contempt and ridicule of the people.To be easy of access, was want of dignity; andcourteous manners degraded the prince. Virtues newto the Parthians were new vices. Between his goodand evil qualities no distinction was made: they wereforeign manners, and for that reason detested.
III. In this disposition of the,public mind, the crownwas offered to Artabanus, a descendant of Arsaces,educated among the Dahi. This prince, after a de­feat in his first engagement, reinforced his army, andgained possession of the crown. Vonones fled to Ar­menia, where, in that juncture, the throne was va­cant; but an irresolute and wavering people couldform no settled plan. They turned their thoughts first ,to Rome, and next to the Parthians, acting with al­ternate treachery to both. The insidious conduct ofMarc Antony, who allured their king Artavasdes tohis friendship, then loaded him with chains, andbasely murdered him, was fresh in thoir minds. Ar-

which had been stationed in the wings, through, fear,or a spirit of mutiny, abandoned their post, and seizeda piece of solid ground beyond the morass. Arminius,though the opportunity was fair, did not embrace it:but soon after, seeing the baggage fast in the mud, orm the ditches, the soldiers gathering round in tumultand disorder; the eagles in confusion; and as in suchcases always happens, each man acting for himself,and deaf to the command of his officers; he orderedhis men to make a vigorous onset, exclaiming, as headvanced, " Behold Varus and his legions! their fate" once more has given them to our swords."
He charged at the head of a chosen band; and, bygashing and mangling the horses, made a dreadfulhavoc. Goaded by wounds, and not able to keep theirlegs on a slimy soil, which was made still more slip­pery by the effusion of their own blood, those animalsin their fury threw their riders, overturned all in theirway, and trampled under their feet the wretches thatlay on the ground. The chief distress was round theeagles; to support them under a heavy volley of dartswas difficult, and to fix them in the swampy groundimpossible. Cecina, exerting himself with undauntedvigour to sustain the ranks, had his horse killed underhim. The barbarians were ready to surround him,if the first legion had not come up to his assistance.At length the rage for plunder, natural to savages,turned the fortune of the day. Intent on booty, theGermans desisted from the fight. The Romans seizedtheir advantage, and towards the close of day gaineda station on the solid ground. Their distress, how­ever, was not al an end: intrenchments were to beraised; earth to be brought; their tools for diggingand cutting the soil were lost; no tents for the sol­diers ; no medicine for the wounded: their provisionsin a vile condition, deformed with filth and blood; anight big with horror hung over their heads; and theensuing day, to a number of brave and gallant men,might prove the last.

He produced and read a decree of the pontifical col­lege, whereby it appeared that the priest of Jupiter,when his health required it, or when he obtained adispensation from the supreme pontiff, might absenthimself from the duties of his function two nights atmost; provided it was not during the public ceremo­nies, nor'more than twice in the course of the year.From this regulation made by Augustus, it was evi­dent that a year's absence, and of course a proconsu­lar government, was incompatible with the sacerdotalfunction. The authority of Lucius Metellus, who,when high pontiff, would not suffer Aulus Posthu-mius, a priest of Jupiter, to depart from Rome, wasalso cited. It followed, that the province of Asiacould not be granted to Maluginensis. It fell to thelot of the person of consular rank, who stood next inseniority.
LXXII. During these transactions, Marcus Lepi-dus petitioned the senate for leave to repair and de­corate, at his own expense, the basilisk of Paulus,that noble monument of the ^2milian family. Thedisplay of private munificence in public works, whichembellished,the city, wus not yet fallen into disuse.In the reign of Augustus without any objection fromthat emperor, Taurus, Phillippus, and Balbus, withthe spoils which they had taken from the enemy, orwith the superfluity of their own immoderate wealth,added greatly to the ornament of Rome, and by con­sequence, to the honour of their families. Encou­raged by this example, hut with a fortune much infe-'rior, Lepidus revived the glory of his ancestors. Thetheatre of Pompey had been destroyed by fire; ana,the remaining branches of the family not being equalto the expense of so great a structure, Tiberius de­clared his intention to build a new edifice, with theoriginal name. He congratulated the senate, thatthe damage occasioned by the late fire, was confinedto that single building. For this, he said, they wereobliged to the vigilance of Sejanus. The senatedecreed a statue to be placed in the theatre of Pom­pey, in honour of the favourite. In a short time af-

were thinned by repeated misfortunes. The Calpur-nian house had lately suffered by the loss of Piso, andthe jEmilian was impaired by the condemnation ofLepida. In order to' make some amends, Decius Sila-nus was restored to the Juniau family. The particu­lars of his case seem to merit some attention. Thelife of Augustus was variously chequered : he was suc­cessful against his country, and m his family oftenunhappy. The mtrigues of his daughter and grand­daughter embittered his days. He ordered them bothto depart from Rome,and punished the adulterers withdeath or banishment. To the commerce natural be­tween the sexes, that emperor gave the naipe of sacri­lege and violated majesty ; and, under colour of thisnew device, forgot at once the lenity of former times,and even the laws enacted by himself. But the tragicissue that befel offenders of this kind, with other me­morable events of that period, shall be the subject ofa distinct history, if, when the work now on hand isfinished, my life shall be protracted in health and vi­gour for a new undertaking.
With regard to Silanus, who had a criminal con­nexion willi the grand-daughter of Augustus; his of­fence drew upon him no greater vengeance than a totalexclusion from the friendship of the emperor. Thatexclusion, as Silanus understood it, implied a sentenceof banishment. He retired into voluntary exile, andnever, till the reign of Tiberius, presumed to apply,either to the prince or senate, for permission to returnto his country. For Jhe favour extended to him; hewas indebted to the weight and influence of his bro­ther, Marcus Silanus, who added to his high rank thefame of distinguished eloquence. Marcus prevailedwith the emperor, and in a full meeting of the senate,expressed his sense of the obligation. Tiberius an­swered, that " the return of Decius Silanus, after a" long absence, was an event agreeable to all. It was," however, no more than his legal right. No law had" abridged his liberty; no decree of the senate was in" force against him. And yet it was impossible for the" prince to forget the wrongs done to Augustus; nor" could the return of Silanus either efface his crime, or

To the44 friends of Pompey's party he wore a mask, affecting"republican principles: he deceived the senate; and" by an extorted decree possessed himself of the fas-" Ces, and the praetorian authority. How long did the44 consuls Hirtius and Pansa survive that event?44 They were both cut off. Did they fall by the handM of the enemy? Who can be certain that Pansa did44 not die by poison infused into his wound, and Hir-"tius by the treachery of his own soldiers? If that" was their fate, is it clear that Augustus was not an" actor in that scene of iniquity ? That he put him-" self at the head of both their armies, is a fact well" known. Having extorted the consulship from a rc-" luctant senate, he threw off the mask, and turned" against the commonwealth the arms which had" been entrusted to him in the cause of liberty against" Marc Antony. What shall be said of the fury of" proscriptions? He seized the lands of Roman citi-" zens, and divided them among his creatures. These" were acts of violence, to this hour unjustified even" by those who advised the measure.

Theinscription further stated the tribute payed by theconquered nations; the specific weight of gold andsilver; the quantity of arms, the number of horses,the offerings of ivory and of rich perfumes presentedto the temples of Egypt; the measure of grain, andthe various supplies administered by every nation;making altogether a prodigious revenue; no way in­ferior to the taxes of late years collected either byParthian despotism, or the authority of Rome.
LXI. In a country abounding with wonders, thecuriosity of Germanicus was not easily satisfied. Hesaw the celebrated statue of Memnon, which, thoughwrought in stone, when played upon by the rays ofthe sun, returns a vocal sound. He visited the pyra­mids, those stupendous structures raised by the emu­lation of kings, at an incredible expense, amidst awaste of sands almost impassable. He saw the pro­digious bason, formed by the labour of man, to re­ceive the overflowings of the Nile ; and in other partsof the river, where the channel is narrowed, he ob­served a depth of water so profound, that the curio­sity of travellers has never been able to explore thebottom. The prince proceeded as far as Elphantine'and Scyend, the boundaries formerly of the Romanempire, though now extended as far as the Red Sea.

made out for the veterans, and their money to beforthwith discharged.
XXXVIII. Meanwhile a party of veterans belonging3o the legions lately in commotion, but at that time
stationed in the territory of the Chajicians, discoveredthe same spirit of disaffection; but the firmness ofMennius, the prefect of the camp, suppressed themischief in its birth. He ordered two of the ringleadersto be seized, and put to death; au act of severity notstrictly legal, but in some degree justified by necessi­ty. He was obliged, however, to seek his safety byflight. The soldiers pursued him. Being detected inbis lurking-placs, he resolved, to face his enemies,and depend upon his own bravery. "It is not," hesaid, " against me, the prsefect of the camp, that this" outrage is committed; it is treachery to Germani-"cus; it is treason to the emperor." The leaders ofthe mutiny were struck with terror. In that momenthe seized the standard, and turning towards the river,declared, in a peremptory tone, that whoever quittedhis rank should surfer as a deserter. The whole bodymarched into winter quarters, murmuring discontent,but not daring to disobey.
XXXIX. During these transactions, the deputies ofthe senate met Germanicus at the Ubian altar, on hisreturn from the Upper Rhine. Two legions, the firstand twentieth, were stationed at that place in winterquarters; and, with them, the veterans lately ap­pointed to follow the colours. To minds in their con­dition, fluctuating between fear and conscious guilt,every circumstance was a new alarm. The deputiesthey were sure, came with instructions to revoke andcancel the terms which violence had extorted. Thecredulity of the common people never works byhalves; they believe without proof, and soon find theauthor of what never happened.

proud of their exploits, and in their late success losingthe memory of past misfortunes. The prince, withthat munificence that graced his character, paid toeach soldier the amount of his loss. Meanwhile theGermans, weakened and disheartened by the ill suc­cess of so many efforts, began to think of pacific mea­sures; nor was it doubted but another summer, ifthey dared to take the field, would complete and endthe war. But Tiberius wished for nothing so muchas the return of Germanicus. His letters were all tothat effect. " It was time," he said, " to visit the" capital, and enjoy the honours of a triumph alreadydecreed. Enough had been performed. The pros-" perous events of war were balanced by misfortunes." Important battles had been fought, and victory had" often attended the Roman arms; but the winds and" waves conspired; and losses at sea, not indeed im-" putable to the general, were very heavy disasters.» Tiberius added, that he himself, under the auspicesw of Augustus, had been sent nine times into Germa-wny; but it was to prudent counsels, more than to
* force of arms, that he owed all his success. It was
* by policy that the Sicambrians were wrought to a
* submission; it was by management that the Sue-
* vians were drawn into an alliance with Rome; and*
* it was the same conduct that made Maroboduusu listen to terms of peace. The honour of the Roman" name was now revived in all its ancient lustre; and" it was therefore time to leave the Cheruscans, and" the hostile states of Germany, to their own dissen-" sions."
Germanicus, notwithstanding these remonstrances^requested leave to continue in the command for oneyear more. Tiberius was not to be diverted from hispurpose. He plied Germanicus with new arguments,and, as a lure to young ambition, threw out the offerof a second consulship, which required personal at­tendance at Rome. He urged, moreover, that if thewar continued, some share of merit ought to be leftto Drusus, the brother of Germanicus, for whom noother field of glory could be found. It was in Germa­ny only that Drusus could acquire the title of Imps­

XXVII. The soldiers, in a tumultuous body, rushedfrom the tribunal, breathing vengeance, and, where-ever they met either the men belonging to the prse-torian bands, or the" friends of Drusus, threateningviolence, in hopes of ending the dispute by a suddenconflict. Cneius Lentul us, whose age and military cha­racter gave him considerable weight, was particularlyobnoxious; he was supposed to be the chief adviserof Drusus, and an enemy to the proceedings of thearmy. For the security of his person, he went asidewith Drusus, intending to repair to the winter camp.The mutineers gathered round him, demanding withinsolence, " which way was he going ? to the senate ?"perhaps to the emperor? Was he there to show"himself an enemy to the demands of the legions?"Nothing could restrain their fury; they discharged avolley of stones; and one of them taking place, Len-tulus, wounded and covered with blood, had nothingto expect but instant death, when the guards that at­tended Drusus came up in time, and rescued him fromdestruction.
XXVIII. The night that followed seemed big withsome fatal disaster, when an unexpected phenomenonput an end to the commotion. In a clear and serenesky the moon was suddenly eclipsed. This appear­ance, in its natural cause not understood by the sol­diers, was deemed a prognostic denouncing the fate ofthe army. The planet, in its languishing state, re­presented the condition of the legions: if it recoveredits former lustre, the efforts of the men would becrowned with success. To assist the moon in herlabours, the air resounded with the clangour of brazeninstruments, with the sound of trumpets, and otherwarlike music. The crowd, in the mean time, stoodat gaze: every gleam of light inspired the men withjoy; and the sudden gloom depressed their hearts withgrief. The clouds condensed, and the moon was sup­posed to be lost in utter darkness. A melancholyhorror seized the multitude; and melancholy is sureto engender superstition.

ae news spread with rapidity; he who heard imper­fectly made his report with additions ; others did thesame : and thus the story went on, gathering strengthfrom mouth to mouth, and diffusing universal joy.The populace ran wild through the streets; they threwopen the gates of the temples; night came on; thehurry still continued; assertion grew more confidentin the dark, and credulity listened with a greedy ear.Tiberius saw the delusion, but calmly left it to itsown futility. Time disclosed the truth; the peoplerenewed their sorrow with redoubled violence, as ifthe prince had been torn from them a second time.
LXXXII1. The senate met to decree honours to hismemory. Friendship put itself to the stretch, andmen of talents exhausted their invention. It wasvoted that the name of Germanicus should be insert­ed in the Salian hymn; that a curule chair, adornedwith a civic crown, should be placed in the college of :Augustan priests; that his statue, wrought in ivory,should be carried in the procession of the Circensiangames; and that the vacancy made by his death inthe list of flamens and augurs, should be filled fromthe Julian family only. Triumphal arches were or­dered to be erected at Rome, on the Rhine, and mountAmanus in Syria, with inscriptions setting forth thesplendour of his actions, and, in direct terms, declar­ing that he died in the service of his country. At. ntioch, where his remains were burnt, a mausoleum
as ordered; and at Epidaphne, where he died, a tri-,unal in honour of his memory. Of the several.,1 atues, and the places where they were to be worship-I od, it would be difficult to give a regular catalogue.
was farther proposed that a shield of pure gold, ex-ceding the ordinary size, should be dedicated to himin the place allotted to orators of distinguished elo-q uence.

country, fifty miles round, was laid waste with fireand sword ; no compassion for sex or age; no dis­tinction of places, holy or profane ; nothing was sa­cred. In the general ruin the Temple of Tanfan,which was held by the inhabitants in the highest ve­neration, was levelled to the ground. Dreadful as theslaughter was, it did not cost a drop of Roman blood.Not so much as a wound was received. The attackwas made on the barbarians sunk in sleep, dispersedin flight, unarmed, and incapable of resistance. Anaccount of the massacre soon reached the Bructe-rians, the Tubantes, and the Usipetes. Inflamed withresentment, those nations took up arms; and postingthemselves to advantage, surrounded the woodsthrough which the Roman army was to pass. Ger-manicus, informed of their motions, marched in orderof battle. Part of the cavalry, with the light cohorts,formed the van; the first legion followed, to supportthem; the baggage moved in the centre. The leftwing was closed by the twenty-first legion, and theright by the fifth. The twentieth, with the auxiliaries,) brought up the rear. The Germans, in close ambush,waited till the army stretched into the woods. Afterskirmishing with the advanced party, and both theflanks, they fell with their whole strength upon therear. The light cohorts, unable to sustain the shockof a close embodied enemy, were thrown into disor­der ; when Germanicus, riding at full speed to thetwentieth legion, cried aloud, " The time is come" when you may efface, by one bravo exploit, the" guilt of the late sedition ; charge with courage, and* you gain immortal honour." Roused by this ani­mating strain, the legion rushed to the attack, and atthe first onset broke the ranks of the enemy. Thebarbarians fled to the open plain: the Romans pur­sued them with dreadful slaughter. Meanwhile thevan of the army passed the limits of the forest, andbegan to throw up intrenchments. From that timethe march was unmolested. The soldiers, flushedwith success, and in the glory of this expedition losingall memory of former guilt, were sent into winterquarters.

" Italy, when reduced to subjection, afforded but few" incentives to luxury. Foreign victories taught us to"dissipate the property of others; and the civil wars ." made us prodigal of our own. But after all, is the" mischief, which the sediles make the ground of their" complaint, the worst of our grievances ? Compare"it with other evils, and it vanishes into nothing." Italy stands in need of foreign supplies, and yet no" reformer tells us, how much the commonwealth is" every day at the mercy of the winds and waves." The produce of colonies is imported to maintain" our pride and luxury, to feed the master of the seil,"and to supply his slaves with the necessaries of life." Should those resources fail, will our groves, our vil-" las, and our spacious pleasure grounds be sufficient" to satisfy our wants ? That care is left to the sove-" reign. Should he neglect that essential duty, the" commonwealth is lost.

advanced, it was too slippery for their feet. Theweight of the soldiers' armour, and the depth of wa­ter, made the management of the javelins almost im­practicable. The Cheruscans, on the contrary, werefighting in their own element; they were used to fensand marshes; their stature was large, and their spearsof a length to wound at a distance. The legions beganto give way, when night came on, and put an end tothe unequal conflict. The barbarians were too muchflushed with success to complain of fatigue, or tothink of rest. During the night they cut a channelfor the waters, and from the neighbouring hills letdown a deluge into the valley. The plains were laidunder water; and the half-finished works being car­ried a way by the flood, the soldier saw that his labourwas to begin again. Csecina had been forty years inthe service. A man of his experience, who had knownthe viccissitudes of war, was not to be disconcerted.He saw, between the morass and the hills, a plain ofsolid ground, large enough for a small army. Tothat spot, having weighed all circumstances, lie judged• it his best expedient to send the wounded with theheavy baggage, and in the mean time to confine theGermans in their woods. For this purpose he sta­tioned the fifth legion in the right wing, and the one-and-twent.ieth in the left; the first legion led the van,and the twentieth brought up the rear.
LXV. The night in both camps was busy and un­quiet, but from different causes. The barbarianspassed their time in jollity and carousing; warlikeBongs and savage howlings kept a constant uproar,while the woods and valleys rung with the hideoussound. In the Roman camp the scene was different:pale gleaming fires were seen; no sound, save that oflow and hollow murmurs; the soldiers lay extendedat length under the palisades, or wandered from tentto tent, fatigued and weary, yet scarce awake.

ruin of that unfortunate prince. Catualda, a youngman of rank, who was formerly compelled by the in­justice of Maroboduus to fly his country, had taken 'refuge among the Gothones. The season of revenge |was at length arrived. At the head of a strong forcehe entered the territory of the Marcomanians. Hav-ing seduced the leading nobles to his party he stormedthe royal palace, and took by assault a strong castlenearly adjoining, where the Suevians had been ac­customed to deposit their plunder. A considerablebooty fell into his hands. He found, besides, a num­ber of victuallers and traders from the Roman pro­vinces ; men who had been attracted to that part ofthe world by the liberty allowed to commerce, and bythe love of lucre were induced to remain, till by forceof habit, they* lost all remembrance of their nativeland.
LXIII. Maroboduus, finding himself deserted byhis people, had no resource but in the friendship ofTiberius. He crossed the Danube, where that riverwashes the confines of Noricum; and thence sent hisdespatches to Rome, not in the humble style of aprince driven from his throne, but, even in ruin, withan elevation of mind worthy of his former grandeur.The substance of his letter was, that the nations whoknew his fame in arms had made him offers of friend­ship, but he chose rather to rely on the protection ofthe Romans. Tiberius promised him a safe retreatin Italy ; with liberty, if his affairs took a favourableturn, to withdraw whenever his interest should invitehim. To the fathers he talked a different language:Philip of Macedon, he said, was not so much to bedreaded by the Athenians, nor Pyrrhus or Antio-chus by the Roman people. His speech on this oc­casion is still extant; we there find him magnifyingthe fortitude of the German chief, and the ferocity ofthe nations over which he reigned with absolutepower. He sets forth the danger of a powerful enemyso near the Roman frontier, and applauds himself forthe wisdom of the measures that brought on the ruinof a great and warlike prince. Maroboduus was re­ceived at Ravenna: and there held up to the Suevians,

probably retaining still the spirit of his ancestors, un­broken by distress. From this time Tiberius neverrelented. While the house of Hortensius sunk intodistress and poverty, he looked on with unconcern,and saw that illustrious family moulder into ruin.
XXXIX. In the courso of this year, the daringgenius of a single slave well nigh involved the em­pire in a civil war. The name of this man wasClemens, formerly retained in the service of Posthu-mus Agrippa. He was no sooner apprised of thedeath of Augustus, than he conceived tho bold designof passing over to the isle of Planasia, with intent,by force or stratagem, to carry off Agrippa, and con­vey him to the German army. This enterprise, con­ceived by a slave, was no indication of a grovellingmind._ He embarked on board a trading vessel, deep­ly laden, and after a tedious passage arrived too late:Agrippa was previously murdered. The man wasnow resolved to act a nobler part. Taking with himthe ashes of the prince^ he sailed to Cosa, a promon­tory of Etruria, and there remained concealed in thesequestered parts of the country, till his hair andbeard were grown into length. He was of his mas­ter's age, and in form and stature not unlike him. Hebegan by his friends and agents to circulate a whis­per that Agrippa was still living. The story, as isusual in the beginning of plots, was helped about byclandestine arts. By degrees the tools of this boldadventurer grew more hardy; the weak and ignorantbelieved every thing; and the bold and turbulent,who wish for nothing so much as convulsions in thestate, received the news with joy and exultation.While the report was gaining ground, the author ofit withdrew with caution from the public eye. Truth,he was aware, is always brought to light by time andreflection; while the lie of the day lives by bustle,noise, and precipitation. The impostor was thereforeresolved to keep the minds of men in a constant fer­ment: he visited the municipal towns, but always inthe dusk of the evening; he went to one place, heflew to another, continually in motion, never longany where; but, as soon as he made his impression,

for her husband softened her fiercer passions, andgave a tincture of delicacy to that haughty spiritwhich nothing could subdue.
XXXIV. Germanicus was now advanced nearer tothe imperial dignity; but his zeal for Tiberius rose inproportion. He required from the Sequanians and theBelgic states the oath of fidelity to the emperor; andbeing informed of the commotions that distracted thearmy, he set forward, without delay, to appease thetumult. The legions met him on the outside of theintrenchments, with downcast eyes, and all the exter­nal symptoms of repentance. He was, however, nosooner within the lines, than the camp resounded withgroans and bitter lamentations. Some laid hold ofthe prince's hand, as if going to kiss it; but insertinghis fingers in their mouths, made him feel their bone­less gums, complaining that they had lost their teethin the service: others showed their bodies bent withage, and drooping under a load of infirmities. A tu­multuous crowd gathered round the tribunal: Ger­manicus ordered them to form in their respectivecompanies, that the men might more distinctly hearhis answer; and, to distinguish the cohorts, he di­rected the standards to bo ranged in proper order.The soldiers obeyed, but with reluctance. Germani­cus opened with the panegyric of Augustus; he pro­ceeded to the victories and triumphs obtained by Ti­berius, insisting chiefly on his exploits in Germany,at the head of those very legions, ^he succession,he observed, was quietly settled: Italy consented,both the Gauls remained in their duty, and peaceprevailed in every part of the empire.
XXXV. Thus far Germanicus was. heard with si­lence, or at worst with a low and hollow murmur. Hemade a transition to the present disturbances:" Where"is now the sense of military duty? Where that an-"cient discipline, the boast and honour of the Roman"armies? Whither have you driven the tribunes?"Where are the centurions?" At these words, thewhole multitude, as if with one instinct, threw off theirclothes, exposing their bodies seamed with woundsfrom the enemy, and with lashes from the centurion.

" for the presence of the emperor." Tiberius heardall that passed, but remained silent. A warm debateensued. At length the fathers agreed to adjourn allbusiness till the prince returned to Rome.
XXXVI. Upon another occasion the same AsiniusGallus had the spirit to clash even with the emperor.He moved, in form, that the election of civil magi­strates should take place at the end of five years; thatthe officers who had the command of a legion, anddischarged that duty before they attained the prsetor-ship, should be declared prsetors elect, without preju­dice to the right of the sovereign to name twelve can­didates. This motion, beyond all doubt, had a deeperaim, pointing directly at the policy of the times, andthe secret maxims of the court. Tiberius affected tosee a design to enlarge the sovereign authority; and,on that ground, replied, " that it was inconsistent with" his moderation to take upon him so vast a charge." The power to choose was a power to exclude; and" the last was painful. The elections, even when an-" nual, were attended with many inconveniencies. The" disappointed candidate was sure to repine at his" want of success, and yet his disgrace was but of" short duration: he consoled himself with hopes of bet-" ter success in the following year. Defer the election" for five years, and the man rejected for that length" of time will find his spirit more deeply wounded." Moreover, at the end of so long a period, who can" answer that his character, his family connexions," and his fortune, will be the same? To grow proud" in office is the nature of man: extend his authority4i to the space of five years, and what will be the con­sequence? Every single magistrate will swell with" the pride of five. The laws, which have wisely" drawn the line, will be subverted; whereas, at" present, the time for soliciting, as well as that of" enjoying*public honours, is fixed with precision."


with a republican spirit, Tiberius strengthened theinterests of despotism. His next measure was a grantof money to certain senators, whose fortunes were in­ferior to their rank. Nothing, however, in tho midst

dispose his father to listen to their petition. The sol­diers answered in humble terms: at their request,the younger BUesus, mentioned above, with Lucius,Apronius, a Roman knight in the train of Drusus,and Justus Catonius, a centurion of the first rank,were despatched as the delegates of the army. Inthe councils afterwards held by Drusus, variousopinions were entertained, and different measures pro­posed. To wait the return of the deputies, and mean­while to win the affections of the men by moderation,was the advice of many. Others were for immediatecoercion: " Lenity, they said, makes no impression"on the vulgar mind. The common men, when not"kept in subjection, are fierce and turbulent; yet ever"ready to crouch and bend under proper authority." It was now the time, while they were overwhelmed"with superstition, to infuse another fear, and teach"them to respect their general. Tho authors of"the late sedition ought to be made a public ex-" ample." Drusus, by the bent of his nature proneto vindictive measures, dosired that Percennius andVibulenus might be brought before him. By hisorders they were put to death; according to somewriters, in his own tent, and there buried; accordingto others, their bodies were thrown over the intrench-ments, a spectacle for public view.
XXX. Diligent search was made for the, most ac­tive incendiaries: Some were found roving on theoutside of the lines, and instantly cut off by the cen­turions, or the prsetorian soldiers. Others were de­livered up to justice by their respective companies,as an earnest of their own conversion. The rigourof the winter, which set in earlier than usual, addedto the afflictions of the army. Heavy rains ensued;and fell with such violence, that the men could notventure from their tents. To meet in parties, andconverse with their comrades, was impossible. Thecolours, borne down by torrents that rushed throughthe camp, were with difficulty secured. Superstitionstill continued to fill the mind with terror. In everything that happened, imagination saw the anger ofthe gods: it was not without reason that the planets

" was last night basely murdered by the hand of gla-" diators whom Blsesus arms for your destruction.4i Answer me, Blsesus, where have you bestowed the" body ? The very enemy allows the rites of sepul-44 ture. When I have washed my brother with the" tears, and printed kisses on his mangled body, then" plunge your poniard in this wretched bosom. I shall" die content, if these my fellow soldiers perform the" last funeral office, and bury in one grave two44 wretched victims, who knew no crime but that of" serving the common interest of the legion."
XXIII. This speech Vibulenus rendered still moreinflammatory by the vehemence of his manner, bybeating his breast, by striking his forehead, and pour­ing a flood of tears. A way being opened through thecrowd, he leaped from the men's shoulders, and gro­velling at the feet of individuals, excited the passionsof the multitude to the highest pitch of frenzy. Intheir fury some fell upon the gladiators retained byBlsesus, and loaded them with irons; others seized thegeneral's domestic train; while numbers dispersedthemselves on every side in quest of the body: and ifit had not been speedily known that no corpse couldbe found ; that the slaves of Btesus averred under thetorture that no murder had been committed; and, infact, that tho incendiary never had a brother, Blsesusmust have fallen a sacrifice. The tribunes, and theprsefect of the camp, were obliged to save themselvesby flight. Their baggage was seized and plundered.Lucilius the centurion was put to death. This man,by the sarcastic pleasantry of the soldiers, had beennicknamed give me another; because, in chastisingthe soldiers, when one rod was broke, he was used tocall for another, and then another. The rest ofthe centurions lay concealed in lurking places. Outof the whole number Julius Clemens, a man of promptand busy talents, was the favourite of the insurgents.He was spared as a fit person to negociate the claimsof the army. Two of the legions, the eighth and fif­teenth, were upon the point of coming to the decisionof the sword: the former bent on the destruction ofSirpicus, a centurion; and the latter determined to

such prosecutions judgment should be pronounced,returned for answer, that the law must take its course.The fact was, Tiberius in his turn had felt the edgeof satire in certain anonymous verses, circulated atthat time, and keenly pointed at his pride, his cruelty,and his dissensions with his mother. /
LXXIII. It will not be deemed an improper di­gression, if we state in this place the cases of twoRoman knights, Falanius and Rubrius, both of nar­row fortunes, and both attacked under the new modeof prosecution. A review of those proceedings willshow the grievance in its origin, and its progress:how it gathered strength from the wily arts of Tibe­rius; from what causes it was for a time suppressed,and afterwards revived in all its force, till it provedin the end the most detestable invention that everharassed mankind. The charge against Falanius was.that he had admitted into one of the fraternities, thenestablished in honour of Augustus, one Cassius, acomedian of profligate manners; and further, that, inthe sale of his gardens, he had suffered a statue ofAugustus to be put up to auction with the rest of hisgoods. The crime alleged against Rubrius was, that,being sworn on the name of Augustus, he was guiltyof perjury. Tiberius, as soon as he was apprized ofthese proceedings, wrote to the consuls—" that divine" honours were not decreed to the memory of his" father in order to lay snares for the people. Cas-" sius, the player, as well as others of his profession,had often assisted in the games dedicated by Livia'" to the memory of the deceased emperor; and if his" statue, in common with those of the gods in gene-" ral, was put up to sale with the house and gardens," the interests of religion would not be hurt. A false" oath on the name of Augustus was the same as a" perjury in an appeal to Jupiter: but the gods must44 be their own avengers."
LXXIV. In a short time after this transactionGranius Marcellus, prator of Bythynia, was accusedof violated majesty by his own qusestor, Csepio Cris-pinus. The charge was supported by Romanus Hispo,a mercenary advocate, who had then lately set up the

of Germanicus, and the auspices of Tiberius. Seve­ral other public monuments were dedicated at thesame time; a temple to Fortune, in the gardens onthe banks of the Tiber, which Julius Csesar had be­queathed to the Roman people; a chapel sacred to theJulian family; and a statue of Augustus in the sub­urbs, called Bmillm.
In the consulship of Caius Csecilius and LuciusPomponius, Germanicus, on the seventh before thecalends of June, enjoyed the glory of a triumph overthe Cheruscans, the Cattians, the Angrivarians, andthe rest of the nations, extending as far as the Elbe.The spoils of the conquered, the prisoners of war,with various pictures of battles, mountains, and rivers,were displayed with great pomp and splendour. Thewar, though the general was not suffered to reap thefull harvest of his glory, was considered by the popu­lace as entirely finished. Amidst the grandeur of thismagnificent spectacle, nothing appeared so strikingas the graceful person of Germanicus, with his fivechildren, mounted on the triumphal car. The joy of 4the multitude was not, however, without a tincture ofmelancholy. Men remembered that Drusus, the fatherof Germanicus, was the darling of the people, andyet proved unfortunate; they called to mind youngMarcellus, blessed with all his country's wishes, yetprematurely snatched away. It happened, they said,by some fatality, that whenever a favoured characterwas the delight of the Roman people, their affec­tions ended always in a general mourning.
XLII. Tiberius gave a largess to the populace ofthree hundred sesterces to each man, and ordered thedistribution to be made in the name of Germanicus,at the same time declaring himself his colleague in theconsulship for the ensuing year. These marks ofgood will were specious, but by no man thought sin­cere. He was now resolved to remove the favouriteof the people. This, however, was to be done undercolour of new honours. He framed a pretence, ortook advantage of that which the posture of affairspresented to him. Archelaus, during a space of fiftyyears, had swayed the sceptre of Cappadocia; but

if they dared to commence hostilities, as a prince thatmight once more ascend the throne. In the space,however, of eighteen years, Maroboduus never oncestirred out'of Italy. He grew gray in indolence; andclinging too long to a wretched life, survived his re­putation.
Catualda experienced a like reverse of fortune, andfound no better refuge. The Hermundurians, led onby Vibillius their chief, expelled him from the throne.The Romans fixed his residence at Foro-Julium, acolony in Narbon Gaul. The barbarians, who fol­lowed the fortunes of the two exiled kings, were notsuffered to incorporate with the people of the pro­vinces ; but to prevent the danger that might otherwiseshake the public tranquillity, were conducted beyondthe Danube, where they had allotments of land be­tween the rivers Marus and Cusus, under the com­mand of Vannius, a man born in the Quadian nation,and by Tiberius made king of the colony.
LXIV. The elevation of Artaxias to the throne ofArmenia being about this time known at Rome, thesenate decreed the lesser triumph to Drusus and Ger-mantcus. Triumphal arches were raised near theTemple of Mars the avenger, and the statues of thetwo princes were placed in a conspicuous point ofview. Tiberius rejoiced at these events; and the moreso, as they were the effect of policy; not of con­quest. By the same insidious arts he now began toplan the destruction of Rhescuporis, king of Thrace.Rhsemetalces at one time reigned sole monarch overthat whole country. After his death Augustus madea partition of the kingdom, assigning to Rhescuporis,the late king's brother one moiety; and the other toCotys, son of the deceased monarch. In this divisionof the kingdom, the cultivated parts of the country,the fertile vales and flourishing cities that lay conti­guous to Greece, fell to the share of Cotys; the wildand barren places, which were open to hostile incur­sions, were allotted to Rhescuporis. The genius ofthe two kings resembled their s6il; the milder virtuesdistinguished the character of Cotys; ferocity, ambi­tion, rapine, and impatience of an equal, were the

the Visurgis, found by a deserter, that Arminius hadalready fixed upon the spot for a general action, andbeing reinforced by other nations, then actually as­sembled in a forest sacred to Hercules, was deter­mined in the dea&of night to storm the Roman camp.This intelligence was thought worthy of credit. Thefires of the enemy gleamed at a distance; the scouts,who advanced to reconnoitre their posts, heard theneighing of horses, and the bustle of a prodigious butundisciplined multitude. In this important moment,on the eve of a decisive battle, the Roman generalthought it a point of moment to explore the sentimentsand inclinations of his men. How to accomplish this,with a degree of certainty, was a difficult point. " The" tribunes and centurions studied more to bring in" agreeable reports, than to relate the truth. The" freedmen still retained an original leaven of servili-" ty, and friends were prone to flattery. In an assem-" bly of the soldiers, a few forward spirits took the" lead, and the whole herd was ready to follow. To" sound the real sentiments of the army, the soldier" must be taken in his unguarded moments, removed" from the eye of his officer, at table with his com-" rades, when, with frank simplicity, he speaks his" mind, and tells his hopes and fears without reserve."
XIII. As soon as night came on, the prince wentforth, through the augural gate, covered with the skinof a wild beast. A single attendant followed him. Hepursued his way through devious paths, unknown tothe sentinels, stopping frequently near the tents, andlistening to his own fame. The nobility of his descentwas the topic with some; others praised the dignityof his person: the greater part talked of his patience,his courage, and that happy temperament, which,upon all occasions, severe or lively, still preserved thedignity of his character. To such a commander, theplace to show their gratitude was the field of battle;there the barbarians ought to suffer for their perfidy;arid there the violator of public treaties should bedoomed a sacrifice to the glory of Germanicus.Amidst these discourses, a soldier from the adversecamp, who could speak the Roman language, rode

less in agitation; their hopes of conquest, the love ofplunder, and the jarring counsels of their chiefs, dis­tracted every mind. The measure proposed by Armi-nius was, to let the Romans break up their camp, andsurround them again in the narrow denies, and in thebogs and marshes. Inguiomer, more fierce and vio­lent, and for that reason more acceptable to the ge­nius of barbarians, was for storming the camp: itwould be carried by a general assault: the number ofprisoners would be greater, and the booty in bettercondition. His advice prevailed. At the point of daythe attack began; at the first onbet the Germans level­led the fosse, threw in heaps of hurdles, and attempt­ed a scalade. The ramparts were thinly manned; thesoldiers, who showed themselves, put on the appear­ance of a panic. The barbarians climbed to the topof the works. In that moment the signal was givento the cohorts; clarions and trumpets sounded throughthe camp; the Romans in a body, and with one ge­neral shout, rushed on to the attack. They fell uponthe enemy in the rear; crying aloud, as they ad­vanced, "Here are no woods; no treacherous fens;" we are here on equal ground, and the gods will de-" cide between us." The barbarians had promisedthemselves an easy conquest. The' affair, they ima­gined, would be with a handful of men; but their sur­prise rose in proportion, when they heard the clangourof trumpets, and saw the field glittering with arms.Tho sudden terror magnified their danger. To beelated with success, and to droop in adversity, is thegenius of savage nations. A dreadful slaughter fol­lowed. The two chiefs betook themselves to flight;Arminius unhurt, and Inguiomer dangerously wound­ed. No quarter was given to the common men. Thepursuit continued as long as day-light and resentmentlasted. Night coming on, the legions returned to theircamp, covered with new wounds, and their provisionsno better than the day before; but health, and food,and vigour, all things were foundin victory.'

Tiberius stopt the proceedings.Against this act of lenity Ateius Capito protestedopenly; contending, with an air of ancient liberty,that " the right of the senate to hear and determine," ought not to be retrenched; especially when a crime" of that magnitude called for vindictive justice. The" prince, in his own case, might be slow to resent; but" let him not be generous at the expense of the pub-" lie.!' This language, blunt as it was, gave no offenceto Tiberius: he saw the drift of the speech, and, dis­regarding the tone with which it was uttered, persistedin his resolution. Capito brought disgrace on hisname. Accomplished as he was in the science of laws,both human and divine, he possessed, besides, a num­ber of virtues that adorned his private character; butby this act of servile flattery he sullied the lustre of adistinguished name.
LXXI. A question that concerned a point of reli­gion was the next subject of debate. The Romanknights had vowed a statue, for the recovery of Livia,to fortune the equestrian. In what temple thisshould be placed was the doubt. At Rome there werevarious structures sacred to the goddess, but none un­der that specific title. Upon inquiry it was foundthat there was at Antium a temple with that particu­lar denomination; and it being Considered that thewhole system of rites and ceremonies, and the severaltemples and images of the gods throughout Italy,were subject to the supreme authority of Rome, itwas resolved that the votive present should be placed! Antium. This being a point of religious ceremony,iberius took the opportunity to determine the ques->n, which had been for some time in suspense, con-rning Servius Maluginensis, the priest of Jupiter.

At this time Germanicus, the immediate descend­ant of Drusus, was appointed to the command ofeight legions on the Rhine. By the emperor's direc­tions Tiberius adopted him as his son, though hehad then issue of his own growing up to manhood.The policy, no doubt, was to guard the succession,with additional securities. Augustus, in that juncture,had no war upon his hands, that in Germany except­ed ; which was carried on, not with a view to exten­sion of empire, or any solid advantage, but solely to'expiate the disgrace incurred by the loss of Varusand his legions. A perfect calm prevailed at Rome:the magistrates, retained their ancient names; theyounger part of .the community were born since thebattle of Actium, and the old during the civil wars:how many were then living who had seen the con­stitution of their country? m
IV. The government thus overthrown, nothing re­mained of ancient manners, or ancient spirit. Of in­dependence, or the equal condition of Roman citizens,no trace was left. All ranks submitted to the will ofthe prince, little solicitous about the present hour;while Augustus, in the vigour of health, maintainedat once his own dignity, the honour of his house, andthe public tranquillity. In process of time, whenworn with age, and failing under bodily infirmities,he seemed to approach the last act, a new scene pre­sented itself to the hopes of men. Some amused them­selves with ideas of ancient liberty, many dreaded thehorrors of a civil war, and others wished for publiccommotion; the greater part discussed, with a varietyof opinions, the character of the new masters at thatmoment impending over the state. " Agrippa was" rude and savage ; disgrace added to his natural fe-" rocity; and in point of age and experience, he was" by no means equal to the weight of empire. Tibe-" rius was matured by years; he had gained a reputa-" tion in war, but the pride of the Claudian family" was inveterate in his nature, and his inbred cruelty,"however suppressed with art, announced itself in" various shapes. Trained up in the imperial house,"in the very bosom of despotism, Jie had been inured

barked the second and the fourteenth legions, and putthem under the command of Publius Vitellius, withdirections to pursue their way over land. Vitelliushad at first a dry shore; but the wind blowing hardfrom the north, and the waves, usual at the equinox,rolling witli a prodigious swell, the soldiers were car­ried away by the torrrent. The country was laid un­der water. The sea, the shore, and the fields pre­sented one vast expanse. The depths and shallows,the quicksands and the solid ground, were no moredistinguished. The men were overwhelmed by thewaves, and absorbed by the eddies. Horses, baggage,and dead bodies, were seen floating together. Thecompanies of the legions were mixed in wild confu­sion, sometimes breast-high in water, and often deeper.Numbers were carried off by the flood, and lost forever. Exhortations and mutual encouragement wereof no avail. Valour and cowardice, prudence andtemerity, wisdom and folly, perished without distinc­tion. Vitellius at length gained an eminence, anddrew the legions after him. The night was passed inthe utmost distress; without fire, without utensils;many of the soldiers naked; the greatest part wounded,and ail in a condition worse than the horrors of asiege. When the enemy is at the gates, an honour­able death still remains; but here their fate waswretched and inglorious. The return of day presenteda new face of things: the waters subsided, and the landappeared. The general pursued his march to the riverUnsingis, where Germanicus was arrived withhis fleet.The two legions were taken on board. A report oftheir total loss was spread far and wide, and evoryday gained credit, till their safe return with Germa­nicus proved the whole to be a false alarm.
LXXI. Meanwhile Stertinius, who had been de­spatched to receive the surrender of Segimer, the brothef of Segestes, conducted that chief, together withhis son, to the city of the Ubians. A free pardon wasgranted to both: to Segimer, without hesitation: tothe son, who was known to have offered indignitiesto the body of Varus, not without some delay.

LXXV. Meanwhile Agrippina, pierced to the heartand her health impaired by affliction, resolved, not­withstanding, to surmount every obstacle that mightretard the hand of justice. She embarked for Italywith the ashes of Germanicus, and her orphan chil­dren. All eyes beheld her with compassion; all weregrieved that a woman of the highest distinction, solately happy with the best of men, and in the splen­dour of a court seen with a universal homage, shouldundertake a melancholy voyage, with the urn of himshe loved, not sure of a just revenge, alarmed for her­self, and by the fruitfulness of her marriage bed ex­posed to calamities yet unknown. Piso was at theisle of Coos. He there received advice that Germa­nicus was no more. Transported with joy beyond all' bounds, he hastened to the temples, and offered victimsas a public thanksgiving. Plancina was still more ex­travagant: she laid aside her mourning for a deceasedsister, to celebrate in her gayest apparel an event sograteful to her heart.' LXXVT. The centurions flocked in crowds to Piso,assuring him that the legions were devoted to his ser­vice, and for that reason exhorted him to resume acommand unjustly taken from him.

" What had"been done, might well be justified: suspicions, un­supported by proof, would soon evaporate; and" vague reports were of no moment.

The intercession ofhis mother was a colour for the part he acted; butthinking men were by no means satisfied. On thecontrary, their hatred of Livia was more embitteredthan ever. They exclaimed without reserve, " Shall" the grandmother admit to her presence a woman" stained with the blood of her grandson ? Shall she" converse in familiar freedom with a murderess ?"Must she receive to her arms an abandoned woman," and by her influence rescue her from the vengeance" of the senate ? The laws protect the meanest citi-" zen; but in, the case of Germanicus they have lost" their vigour. Vitellius and Veranius poured forth" their eloquence in the cause of a prince cut off by" treachery, while the emperor and his mother side" with Plancina. That pernicious woman may now" with impunity continue her trade of poisoning; she" may practise her detestable arts on the life of Agrip-" pina and her children; she may proceed in her ini-" quity, and, with the blood of an illustrious, but un-" happy family, glut the rage of a dissembling uncle" and a worthless grandmother."

taxias, the son of that unfortunate prince, conceivedfrom that tragic event a rooted aversion to the Ro­man name. He ascended the throne his father, andwith tlie assistance of the Parthians stood at bay withRome, till he fell at last by the perfidy of his own re­lations. After his death, Tigranes, by the appoint­ment of Augustus, was raised to the throne. Tibe­rius Nero, at the head of a powerful army, conductedhim to the capital of his dominions, The reign ofthis prince was short. His issue succeeded; but theline became extinct, notwithstanding the intermar­riages of brother and sister, allowed by the policy ofeastern nations, to strengthen the royal line. By or­der of Augustus, Artavasdes succeeded. To supporthis cause, Rome exerted her strength, and spilt theblood of her armies, but without success. The newking was driven from the throne.
IV. In that juncture, Caius Csesar was' sent tocompose the troubles in Armenia. With the consentof the people that young commander placed the crownon the head of Ariobarzanes, by birth a Mede, dis-} tinguished by his rare accomplishments, and his grace­ful figure. After the death of this prince, who losthis life by an accident, the people refused obedienceto his descendants. A woman of the name of Eratosucceeded: but a female reign did not last long. Fromthat time the nation continued in a state of anarchy,without a master, yet not in possession of liberty. Itwas in this posture of affairs that Vonones enteredArmenia. The people received him with open arms.Artabanus, in the mean time, threatened to invadethe kingdom. The Armenians were not in force; andRome, without undertaking an expensive war againstthe Parthians, could not espouse their cause.

VII. The vacation from public business was nowconcluded. The people returned to their ordinaryfunctions, and Drusus set out for tho army in Illyri-cum. At Rome, in the mean time, all were impatientto see Piso brought to justice. That an offender ofsuch magnitude should be suffered to roam at largethrough the delightful regions of Asia and Achaia,roused the general indignation. By such contumacythe law was eluded, and the evidence was growingweaker every day. The fact was, Martina, that no­torious dealer in poison, whom Sentius, as has beenmentioned, ordered to be conveyed to Rome, diedsuddenly at Brundusium. Poison is said to havebeen found in the tangles of her hair, but no trace ofsuicide appeared on any part of her body.
VIII. Piso, taking his measures in time, sent hisson to Rome with instructions to prepossess the em­peror in his favour. He went himself to seek an in­terview with Drusus; persuaded that he should findthe prince not so much exasperated at the loss of abrother, as pleased with an event that delivered himfrom a rival. The son arrived at Rome. Tiberius,to show that nothing was prejudged, gave the youtha gracious reception; adding the presents usually be­stowed on persons of rank on their return from theprovinces. Drusus saw the elder Piso, and franklytold him, that if what was rumoured abroad appearedto be founded in truth, the charge demanded hiskeenest resentment; but he rather hoped to find thewhole unsupported by proof, that no man might de­serve to suffer for the death of Germanicus. Thisanswer was given in public; no private audience wasadmitted. The prince, it was generally believed, hadhis lesson from Tiberius; it being improbable that a

down to the invasion of Gaul. The consternationwas such, that numbers proposed to demolish thebridge over the Rhine. Vile as the project was, therewere men who, through fear, would have been hardyenough to carry it into execution, if Agrippina hadnot prevented so foul a disgrace. Superior to theweakness of her sex, she took upon her, with an he­roic spirit, the functions of a general officer. She at­tended to the wants of the men; she distributed clothesto the indigent, and medicines to the sick. Pliny hasleft, in his history of the wars in Germany, a descrip­tion of Agrippina, at the head of the bridge, reviewingthe soldiers as they returned, and with thanks andcongratulations applauding their valour. This con­duct alarmed the jealous temper of Tiberius: " Such" active zeal," he said," sprung from sinister motives;" those popular virtues had not for their object the" enemies of Rome. The soldiers were caressed for" other purposes. What remained for the commander" if a woman can thus unsex herself at the head of" the eagles? She reviews the legions, and by larges-" ses draws to herself the affections of the men. Was" it not enough for her ambition, that she showed her" son to the army, and carried him from tent to tent," in the uniform of the common soldier, with the title" of Csesar Caligula? This woman towers above the" commanders of the legions, and even above their" general officer. She can suppress an insurrection," though the name and majesty of the prince makes"no impression." These were the reflections thatplanted thorns in the breast of Tiberius. By the artsof Sejanus, the malice of his heart was still more en­venomed. That minister studied the character of hismaster. He practised on his passions, and had theskill to sow in time the seeds of hatred, which heknew would work in secret, and at a distant daybreak out with collected force.

A general outcry followed. They complained of theprice exacted for relaxations of duty; they mentionedthe miserable pittance which they received for theirdaily pay; they set forth their various hardships, andin particular their unremitting labour at the intrench-ments, the fatigue of carrying provisions, wood, andforage, with a detail of other employments, sometimesimposed by necessity, and frequently to prevent idle­ness in the camp, The clamour of the veterans wasoutrageous; they had served thirty years and more,and when were they to expect a cessation of misery ?They desired a retreat for old ago, that they mightnot languish in despair, and wait till the hand of deathreleased them from their troubles. Some demandedimmediate payment of the legacies bequeathed byAugustus. They offered up ardent vows for the suc­cess of Germanicus; assuring him, if he wished toseize the sovereign power, that they were to a mandevoted to his service.
Struck with horror, and dreading the contagion ofso foul a crime, Germanicus leaped from the tribunal.The soldiers sword in hand opposed his passage, andeven threatened violence if he did not return. Theprince was resolved to perish, rather than forfeit hishonour. He drew his sword, and pointed it to hisbreast, ready to plunge it to his heart. The peoplenear him stopped his hand; but the crowd at a dis­tance, and even some who dared to advance, had theinsolence to bid him strike: one in particular, byname Calusidius, presented a naked sword, adding atthe same time, Take this; it is sharper than your own.This behaviour, even in the moment of frenzy, ap­peared to the soldiers an atrocious act. A pauseensued. The friends of Germanicus seized the oppor­tunity, and conveyed him to his tent.

The tribe of astrologers and magicians, by a decreeof the senate, was banished out ol Italy. Two of thenumber suffered death; namely, Lucius Pituanius, .and Publius Marcius. The former was thrown head­long from the Tarpeian rock ; and the latter, by or­der of the consuls, was executed, at the sound of atrumpet, on the outside of the Esquiline gate, ac­cording to the form prescribed by ancient usage.
XXXIII. At the next meeting of the senate, theluxury of the times became the subject of debate.The business was introduced by Quintus Haterius,of consular rank, and Octavius Fronto, who had dis­charged the office of prater. A law was passed, pro­hibiting the use of solid gold for the service of thetable; and further enacting, that men should not dis­grace themselves by the effeminate delicacy of silkapparel. Fronto took a wider compass. He proposedthat the quantity of silver in every family, the ex­pense of furniture, and the number of domestics,should be limited by law. The senators at that timedid not confine themselves to the question dependingbefore the assembly: but every speaker was at liber­ty to start new matter, and submit to considerationwhatever he thought conducive to the public good.
Asinius (I alius rose in opposition to the opinion ofOctavius Fronto. " The commonwealth," he said," had increased in grandeur, and the wealth of indi-" viduals grew with the growth of empire. Nor was" this a modern innovation; the same effect, from the" same causes, may be traced in the early period of" the commonwealth. The Fabricii had their private" wealth, and so had the Scipios, but different in de-"gree. Wealth, is relative, always in proportion to" the affluence of the times. When the state was poor," frugality was the virtue of a citizen. Does the em-" piro flourish? Individuals flourish with it. In mat-"ters of domestic expense, such as plate and retinue," the measure of economy or extravagance must be" determined by the circumstances of the family." Nothing is mean, nothing superfluous, but what i»" made so by the condition of the parties. The for-" tune of a senator, as settled by law, differs from the

jection, returned a considerable number, whom theyhad ransomed from their maritime neighbours. Somewere thrown on the coast of Britain, and there re­leased by the petty princes of the country. Accordingto the distance from which the men returned, the ac­count of their perils was swelled with marvellous ad­ventures; they talked of hurricanes and birds, unheardof before; of sea-monsters and ambiguous forms,partly man, and partly fish; things either seen, or elsethe coinage of imaginations crazed with fear.
XXV. The news of these disasters spreading farand wide, the Germans began to think of renewingthe war. Nor was Germanicus less active to coun­teract their designs. He despatched Caius Siliuswith thirty thousand foot, and three thousand horse,to make war on the Cattians; and, in the mean timemarched himself, at the head of a greater force, toinvade the Marsians. Malovendus, the chief of thatnation, had lately surrendered to the protection ofRome. From him intelligence was gained, that theeagle of one of the legions commanded by Varus, layin a trench covered with earth, in a neighbouringgrove, and the guard stationed there could make but•a feeble resistance. Two parties were sent forward
without delay; one to attack the enemy in front, anddraw them from their post; the other to enter thewood in the rear, and recover the eagle. Success at­tended both expeditions. Germanicus now resolvedto penetrate into the heart of the country; he carrieddestruction wherever he marched, the enemy in everydirection flying before him, or if any where theymade a stand, either routed or put to the sword. Ac­cording to the account brought in by the prisoners, amore general panic was never known. All agreedthat the Romans rose superior to adversity; a raceof men not to be subdued. Their fleet destroyed,their arms lost in the deep, the coast of Germany co­vered with the dead bodies of men and horses; andyet, said the astonished Germans, they return undis­mayed, and with their former ferocity renew thecharge, as if calamity increased their numbers.

ancient patrician family of the Sulpicii. He wasborn at Lanuvium, a municipal town: he distinguish­ed himself by his military services, had considerabletalents for business, and was raised by Augustus tothe honour of the consulship. Having afterwardsstormed and taken the strong holds of the Homona-densians in Cilicia, he obtained triumphal honours.He attended Caius Caisar in his expedition to Arme­nia, the chief director of his councils, and made useof that opportunity to pay his court with secrecy, toTiberius, while that prince resided in the isle ofRhodes. This anecdote Tiberius mentioned in hisletter; declaring himself, in gracious terms, wellpleased with the good offices of Quirinius, and at thesame time, reflecting with a degree of acrimony onMarcus Lollius, to whose conduct he imputed thedissensions between himself and Caius Csesar. Butthe character of Quirinius was held in no esteem; hisunrelenting prosecution of Lepida, already related,was still remembered ; and the sordid avarice of theman, even in old age, and in the height of power, lefta stain upon his memory.
XLIX. The year closed with a prosecution of asingular nature. Caius Lutorius Priscus, a Romanknight, was the author of an applauded poem on thedeath of Germanicus, and for his composition hadreceived a reward from Tiberius. The crime laid tohis charge was, that, when Drusus lay ill, he preparedanother elegy, from which he hoped, if the youngprince died, to derive still greater emolument. Withthe vanity of a poet, Lutorius read his verses at thehouse of Publius Petronius, in the presence of Vitel-lia, the mother-in-law of that senator. Several wo­men of distinction were of the party. As soon as theprosecutor opened the heads of his accusation, theconfidential friends of the author were struck withterror. The fact was admitted by all, except Vitellia:she had the memory of a liberal-minded woman, andcould recollect nothing. Credit, however, was givento the rest of the evidence. Haterius Agrippa, con­sul elect, was the first to give his opinion: he proposedthat the unfortunate poet should suffer death.
