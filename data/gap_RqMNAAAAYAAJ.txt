37. On their arrival at Rome, the ambassadors ofthe allies were admitted to audience before those ofthe king. Their discourse, in general, was filled upwith invectives against Philip. What produced thegreatest effect on the minds of the senate was, that,by pointing out the relative situations of the lands andseas in that part of the world, they made it manifest toevery one that if the king held Demetrias in Thessaly,Chalcis in Euboea, and Corinth in Achaia, Greececould not he free; and they added, that Philip him­self, with not more insolence than truth, used to callthese the fetters of Greece. The king's ambassadorswere then introduced, and, when they were beginninga long harangue, they were stopped by a short ques­tion, Whether he was willing to yield up the threeabove-mentioned cities? They answered, that they hadreceived no specific instructions on that head: on whichthey were dismissed, without having made any pro­gress towards a peace. Full authority was given toQuintius to determine every thing relative to war andpeace. As this demonstrated clearly that the senatewere not weary of the war, so he who was moreearnestly desirous of conquest than of peace, neverafterwards consented to a conference with Philip; andeven gave him notice that he would not admit any em­bassy from him, unless it came with information thathis troops were retiring from Greece.
38. Philip now perceived that he must decide thematter by arms, and collect his strength about himfrom all quarters. Being particularly uneasy in re­spect to the cities of Achaia, a country so distant fromhim, and also of Argos, even more, indeed, than ofCorinth, he resolved, as the most advisable method, toput the former into the hands of Nabis, tyrant of Lace-daemon, in trust as it were, on the terms, that if heshould prove successful in the war, Nabis should re­deliver it to him; if any misfortune should happen, he

The attentionof the fathers being roused, they proceeded to men­tion, that the twelve Latine colonies which had re­fused a supply of soldiers to Quintus Fabius andQuintus Fulvius, when consuls, enjoyed now, for al­most the sixth year, an immunity from serving in war,as if it had been a privilege granted to do them honor,and on account of their good conduct; while theworthy and dutiful allies, in return for their fidelityand obedience, had been exhausted by continual leviesthrough the course of many years. These words atonce recalled to the recollection of the senate a matterwhich had been almost forgotten, and at the same timeroused their resentment; so that before they sufferedthe consuls to proceed on any other business, they de­creed, that the consuls should summon to Rome themagistrates, and ten principal inhabitants from each ofthe following colonies, so privileged: Nepete, Su-trium, Ardsca, Cales, Alba, Carseoli, Sara, Suessa,Circaea, Narnia, and Interamna; and should give themorders, that whatever was the greatest number of sol­diers which they had separately furnished to the Ro­man people, at any time, since the enemy came intoItaly, they should now provide to the amount of twicethat number of footmen, and one hundred and twentyhorsemen: and if any of them were unable to produceso many horsemen, that then they should be allowedto bring three footmen, instead of each horseman.That both horsemen and footmen should be chosenfrom among the wealthiest orders, and should be sentwherever there was occasion for a supply out of Italy.That if any of them should refuse to comply with thisrequisition, it was their pleasure that the magistratesand deputies of that colony should be detained; and ifthey demanded an audience of the senate, that itshould not be granted them until they had obeyedthose injunctions; and farther, that an annual tax ofone ass on every thousand which they possessed,should be imposed on them.

his camp at the distance of about fifteen hundred pacesfrom the enemy. From hence the rampart of the Car­thaginians seemed to be almost close to the wall ofGrumentum; the actual distance, however, was fivehundred paces. Between the Carthaginian and Ro­man camps the ground was level; and on the left-hand side of the Carthaginians, and right of the Ro­mans, stood some naked hills, from which neitherparty apprehended any mischief, because there wereno woods, nor any covering for an ambuscade. Par­ties sallying from the advanced posts fought severalskirmishes of little consequence. It appeared plainlythat the Roman general had no other object in viewthan to hinder the enemy from quitting the place;while Hannibal, wishing to get away, frequently drewout bis whole strength, and offered battle. On thisoccasion the consul adopted the crafty genius of hisadversary; and, as there could be little apprehensionof a surprise, the hills being open, and having beenexamined by his scouts, he ordered five cohorts, withfive additional companies, to pass over their summitin the night, and conceal themselves in the valleys onthe other side. The time when they were to rise fromtheir ambush he settled with Tiberius Claudius Asel-lus, military tribune, and Publius Claudius, prefectof the allies, whom he sent at their head. He him­self, at the dawn of day, drew out all his forces, bothfoot and horse, into the field. In a short time afterHannibal also, on his side, displayed the signal forbattle, and a great noise ensued in his camp, while themen ran hastily to arms. Then all, both horse andfoot, rushed eagerly out of the gates, and scatteringthemselves over the plain, advanced hastily to attackthe enemy. The consul, observing them in this dis­order, commanded Caius Aurunculeius, tribune of thethird legion, to make his cavalry charge them with allpossible fury, remarking, that ' they had spread them­selves like cattle over the plain, and in such confusionthat, before they could be formed, they might be riddendown and trodden under foot.'

selves masters of the city in the sudden confusion;and then to seize on Norba and Circeii. Informationof this atrocious plot was brought to Rome, to LuciusCornelius Merula, the city pretor. Two slaves cameto him before day, and disclosed the whole proceedingsand intentions of the conspirators. The pretor, order­ing them to be guarded in his own house, summoned ameeting of the senate; and having laid before themthe information of the discoverers, he was ordered togo himself to the spot, and examine into, and crushthe conspiracy. Setting out, accordingly, with fivelieutenants-general, he compelled such as he found inthe country to take the military oath, to arm., andfollow him. Having by this tumultuary kind of levyarmed about two thousand men, before it was possibleto guess his destination he came to Setia. There theleaders of the conspiracy were instantly apprehended;on which, the remainder fled from the city; but partieswere sent through the country to search them out.The services of the two who made the discovery, andof one free person employed, were highly meritorious.The senate ordered a present to the latter of a hundredthousand asses:i to the slaves, twenty-five thousandasses3 each, and their freedom. The price was paidto the.ir owners out of the treasury. Not long after,intelligence was received, that others, out of the re­maining spirit of the conspiracy, had formed a designof seizing Prameste. The pretor, Lucius Cornelius,went thither, and inflicted punishment on near fivehundred persons concerned in that wicked scheme.The public were under apprehensions that the Car­thaginian hostages and prisoners fomented these plots:watches were, therefore, kept at Rome in all thestreets, which the inferior magistrates were ordered togo round and inspect; while the triumvirs of the pri­son, called the Quarry, were to keep a stricter guardthan usual. Circular letters were also sent by thepretor to all the Latine states, directing that the hos-

Amynander, having little confi­dence in his own troops, requested aid from the con­sul; and then advancing towards Gomphi, he stormedon his march a place called Pheca, situate betweenthat town and the narrow pass which separates Thes-saly from Athamania. He then attacked Gomphi,and though the inhabitants defended it for severaldays with the utmost vigor, yet, as soon as he hadraised the scaling-ladders to the walls, the same ap­prehensions which had operated on others, made themcapitulate. This capture of Gomphi spread the great­est consternation among the Thessalians: their for­tresses of Argenta, Pherinus, Thimarus, Lisinae, Sti-mon, and Lampsus, surrendered, one after another,with several other garrisons equally inconsiderable.While the Athamanians and iEtolians, delivered fromfear of the Macedonians, converted to their own profitthe fruits of another's victory, and Thessaly, ravagedby three armies at once, knew not which to believe itsfoe or its friend, the consul marched on, through thepass which the enemy's flight had left open, into thecountry of Epirus. Though he well knew whichparty the Epirots, excepting their prince Charopus,were disposed to favor, yet as he saw that even fromthe motive of atoning for past behavior, they obeyedhis orders with diligence, he regulated his treatmentof them by the standard of their present rather than oftheir former temper, and by this readiness to pardon,conciliated their affection for the future. Then, send­ing orders to Corcyra, for the transport ships to comeinto the Ambrician bay, he advanced by moderatemarches, and on the fourth day pitched his camp onMount Cercetius.

ing, he began to fear, lest even the garrison might beendangered, as it was not easy to retreat from it: hetherefore left the command at Messana to his brother,Lucius Scipio, 'and going on board as soon as the tideturned, he let his ships drive with the current. On theother hand, Hannibal sent forward directions from theriver Aleces, which is not far from Locri, that hisparty, at dawn of day, should attack the Romans andLocrensians with their whole force; in order that,while the attention of all should be turned to thetumult occasioned thereby, he might make an unex­pected assault on the opposite side of the city. When,at the first appearance of daylight, he found that thebattle was begun, he did not choose to attempt thecitadel, in which there was not room, had he evengained it, for such numbers to act, nor had he broughtladders to effect a scalade. Ordering therefore thebaggage to be thrown together in a heap, he drew uphis army at a little distance from the walls, to terrifythe enemy; and while all things necessary for the as­sault were getting ready, he rode round the city withsome Numidian horsemen to find out the properestplace at which it might be made. As he advanced nearthe rampart, the person next to him happened to bestruck by a dart from a scorpion: he was so terrified atthe danger to which he had been exposed, that he or­dered a retreat to be sounded, and fortified his campfar beyond the reach of a weapon. The Roman fleetarrived from Messana at Locri, while some hours ofday remained, so that the troops were all landed andbrought into the city before sunset. Next day, theCarthaginians, from the citadel, began the fight. Han­nibal, now furnished with scaling ladders, and everything proper for an assault, was coming up to thewalls, when on a sudden a gate flying open, the Romansrushed out on him, when he apprehended nothing lessthan such an encounter, and, as the attack was unex­pected, two hundred of his men were slain.

Although Scipio had not obtainednor earnestly solicited authority to levy soldiers, heyet was permitted to iurol volunteers; and as he haddeclared that the fleet should be no expense to thepublic, so he might receive such contributions asshould be offered by the allies for building new ships.The states of Etruria first promised to give assistanceto the consul proportioned to the respective abilities ofeach; the people of Caere engaged to bring corn andprovisions of all kinds for the seamen; the Populo-nians, iron; the Tarquinians, canvass for sails; theVolaterrans, tackling and corn; the Arretians, thirtythousand shields, the same number of helmets; ofjavelins, short pikes, and long spears, each an equalnumber, amounting in the whole to fifty thousand; toSupply axes, mattocks, bills, buckets, and millstones,sufficient for forty ships of war, with one hundred andtwenty thousand pecks of wheat; they also promisedto contribute to the expense of the decurionsi androwers. The people of Per'^ium, Clusium, and Ru-sella gave assurance of fir lor building ships, and alarge quantity of corn. The states of Umbria, withthe people of Nursia, Reate, and Amiternum, and thewhole country of the Sabines, engaged to furnish sol­diers. Fir however he took out of the woods belong­ing to the state. Great numbers of the Marsians, Pe-lignians, and Marrusinians, voluntarily gave in theirnames to serve in the fleet. The Camertans, thoughconfederated with the Romans on equal terms, sent acohort of six hundred men and arms. Having laidthe keels of thirty ships, twenty quinqueremes, andten quadriremes, Scipio pressed forward the work byhis personal attendance in such a manner, that on theforty-fifth day after the timber had been broughtfrom the woods, the ships were rigged, armed, andlaunched.

Having set out in the night, he turned offtowards Picenum, and, making the longest possiblemarches, proceeded directly towards his colleague,having left the command of the camp to Quintus Ca-tius, lieutenant-general.
44. At Rome there was no less fright and consterna­tion than had been felt two years before, when theCarthaginian camp was brought close to the walls andgates of the city: nor could people well determinewhether they should commend or blame the consul forhis boldness in undertakingsuch an adventurous march.It was evident that his reputation would depend on theissue, though there is not perhaps a more unfair me­thod of judging. People considered, with alarmingapprehensions, that ' the camp, in the neighborhood ofsuch a foe as Hannibal, had been left without a gene­ral, and under the guard of an army, the strength ofwhich bad been carried away: that the consul, pre­tending an expedition into Lucania, when in fact hewas going to Picenum and Gaul, had left his campdestitute of any other means of safety than merely theenemy's want of information as to the general and apart of his army having quitted it. What would bethe consequence if this should be discovered, and ifHannibal should resolve, either with his whole armyto pursue Nero, whose intire force was but six thou­sand men, or to assault the camp, which was left as aprey, without strength, without command, without aus­pices V The past disasters of this war, and the deathsof the two consuls in the last year, served also to in­crease these terrible fears. Besides, they reflectedthat 'all those misfortunes had happened while therewas but one general and one army of the enemy inItaly; whereas, at present, there were two Punic warsthere, two numerous armies, and, in a manner, twoHaunibals: for Hasdrubal was a son of the same fa­ther, Hamilcar; was a commander equally enterprising,

in their full force. At length Aristssnus, the pretor ofthe Achaeans, not to dismiss the council without anybusiness being introduced, said: 'Acheeans, where arenow those violent disputes, in which, at your feastsand meetings, whenever mention was made of Philipand the Romans, you scarcely refrained from blows?Now, in a general assembly, summoned on that singlebusiness, when you have heard the arguments of theambassadors on both sides, when the magistrates de­mand your opinions, when the herald calls you to de­clare your sentiments, you are struck dumb. Althoughyour concern for the common safety be insufficient fordetermining the matter, cannot the party zeal whichhas attached you to one side or the other extort a wordfrom any one of you? especially when none is so blindas not to perceive that the time for declaring and re­commending what each either wishes or thinks mostadvisable, must be at the present moment; that is, be­fore we make any decree. When a decree shall beonce passed, every man, even such as at first may havedisapproved the measure, must then support it as goodand salutary.' These persuasions of the pretor, so farfrom prevailing on any one person to declare his opi­nion, did not excite in all that numerous assembly, col­lected out of so many states, so much as a.murmur ora whisper.
21. Then the pretor, Aristaenus, proceeded thus:—'Chiefs of Achaea, you are not more at a loss what ad­vice to give than you are for words to deliver it in; butevery one is unwilling to promote the interest of thepublic at the risk of danger to himself. Were I in aprivate character, perhaps I too should be silent; but,as pretor, it is my duty to declare that I see evidently,either that the ambassadors ought to have been refusedan audience of the council, or that they ought not to bedismissed from it without an answer. Yet how can Igive them an answer, unless by a decree of yours?And, since not one of you who have been called to thisassembly either chooses or dares to make known hissentiments, let us examine (as if they were opinions

iug was intirely disconcerted by the manner in whichthe Romans made their onset, which was not morebrisk than it was obstinate; for the light infantry, as ifin a general line of battle, after discharging their ja­velins, carried on a close fight with their swords; andthe horsemen, when they had once made a charge,stopping their horses, fought, some on horseback, whileothers dismounted and intermixed themselves with thefoot. By this means neither were the king's cavalry,who were unaccustomed to a steady fight, a match forthe others; nor were the infantry, who were unac­quainted with any other mode of fighting but that ofskirmishing and irregular attacks, and were besidesbut half-covered with the kind of harness which theyused, at all equal to the Roman infantry, who carrieda sword and buckler, and were furnished with properarmor, both to defend themselves and to annoy theenemy: nor did they sustain the combat, but fled totheir camp, trusting intirely to their speed for safety.
36'. After an interval of one day the king, resolvingto make an attack with all his cavalry and light-armedinfantry, had, during the night, placed in ambush, ina convenient place between the two camps, a body oftargeteers, whom they call peltastas, and given ordersto Athenagoras and the cavalry, if they found they hadthe advantage in the open fight, to pursue their suc­cess; if not, that they should retreat leisurely, and bythat means draw on the enemy to the place where theambush lay. The cavalry accordingly did retreat; butthe officers of the body of targeteers, by bringing for­ward their men before the time, and not waiting for thesignal, as they ought, lost an opportunity of performingconsiderable service. The Romans having gained thevictory in open fight, and also escaped the danger ofthe ambuscade, retired to their camp. Next day theconsul marched out with all his forces, and offeredbattle, placing his elephants (which had been taken inthe Punic war) in the front of the foremost battalions,and which was the first time that the Romans madeuse of those creatures in the field.

if in Tellers, to slaughter. The targeteers of the Celti-berians being thus almost intirely cut off, the lighttroops and the Carthaginians, who had come from theother camp to support them, were quickly routed andput to the sword. About two thousand foot and allthe cavalry fled with Mago at the very onset. Hanno,the other general, and those who came up last, afterthe battle was decided, were taken alive. Almost thewhole of the cavalry, and what veteran infantry theybad, following Mago in his flight, came on the tenthday to Hasdrubal in the province of Gades: the Celti-berian soldiers, being newly levied, dispersed into theneighboring woods, and thence escaped to their re­spective homes. By this seasonable victory was sup­pressed a war, which was not of so much importanceon account of its present magnitude, as of its being afoundation from which one much more considerablemight have arisen, had the enemy been allowed, afterhaving roused the Celtiberians to arms, to persuadethe other stales to join in the same cause. Scipio,therefore, having bestowed liberal commendations onSilamis, and seeing reason to hope that he might beable to finish the dispute at once by exerting himselfwith proper activity, advanced into Farther Spainagainst Hasdrubal. The Carthaginian (who happenedat that time to have his army in Baetica, for the pur­pose of securing the fidelity of his allies in that coun­try), decamping hastily, led it away, in a manner muchmore resembling a flight than a march, quite to theocean and Gades. He was fearful, however, that aslong as he kept bis forces together, he should be con­sidered as the primary object of the enemy's opera­tions. Before he passed over the strait to Gades, hetherefore dispersed them into the different cities; inthe view, likewise, that they might provide for theirown safety by help of walls, and for that of the townsby their arms.

post for fortifying himself was on the river Aous. Thisriver runs in a narrow vale, between two mountains,one of which the natives call the river Asnaus, afford­ing a passage of very little breadth along the bank.He ordered Athenagoras, with the light infantry, totake possession of Asnaus, and to fortify it. His owncamp he pitched on iEropus. Those places, where therocks were steep, were defended by guards of a fewsoldiers only; the less secure he strengthened, somewith trenches, some with ramparts, and others withtowers. A great number of engines, also, were dis­posed in proper places, that, by means of weaponsthrown from these, they might keep the enemy at adistance. The royal pavilion was pitched on the out­side of the rampart, on the most conspicuous emi­nence, in order, by this show of confidence, to dis­hearten the foe, and raise the hopes of his own men.
6. The consul received intelligence from Charopusof Epirus, that the king, with his army, had postedhimself in this pass. As soon therefore as the springbegan to open, he left Corcyra, where he had passedthe winter, and, sailing over to the continent, led onhis army. When he came within about five milesof the king's camp, leaving the legions in a strongpost, he went forward in person with some light troopsto view the nature of the country; and, on the day fol­lowing, held a council, in order to determine whetherhe should, notwithstanding the great labor and dangerto be encountered, attempt a passage through the de­files occupied by the enemy, or lead round his forcesby the same road through which Sulpicius had pene­trated into Macedonia the year before. The delibera­tions on this question had lasted several days, whennews arrived that Titus Quintus had been elected con­sul; that he had obtained, by lot, Macedonia as hisprovince; and that hastening his journey, he had al­ready come over to Corcyra.

Theother provinces were distributed in this manner: withregard to the pretors, the city jurisdiction was assignedto Publius Licinius Varus; the foreign, with suchother employment as the senate should direct, to Pub­lius Licinius Crassus, chief pontiff; Sicily to SextusJulius Caesar, and Tarentum to Quintus Claudius, Ha­nsen. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus was continued in com­mand for the year, and ordered with one legion tohold the government of the province of Capua, whichhad been held by Titus Quintius, when pretor. CaiusHostilius Tubulus was likewise continued, that, as pro-pretor, he might succeed Caius Calpurnius in the com­mand of the two legions in Etruria; and Lucius Vetu-rius Philo was continued, that he might, in quality ofpropretor, retain the government of his present pro­vince of Gaul, with the same two legions which he hadthere when pretor. With regard to Caius Auruncu-leius, who, in his pretorship, had, with two legions,held the government of the province of Sardinia, thesenate passed a decree in the same terms with thatrespecting Lucius Veturius, but, for the defence of thatprovince, an additional force was assigned him of fiftyships of war, which Scipio was to send from Spain.The business of continuing all these officers in com­mand was laid before an assembly of the people.

50. During that year provisions were remarkablycheap. The curule ediles, Marcus Claudius Marcel-lus and Sextus jElius Paetus, distributed among thepeople a vast quantity of corn brought from Africa, atthe rate of two asses a peck. They also celebrated theRoman games in a magnificent manner, repeating thema second day; and erected in the treasury five brazenstatues out of the money paid as fines. The plebeiangames were thrice repeated intire, by the ediles, Lu­cius Terentius Massa, and Cneius Baebius Tamphilus,who was elected pretor. There were also funeral gamesexhibited that year in the forum for the space of fourdays, on occasion of the death of Marcus ValeriusLajvinus, by his sons Publius and Marcus, who gavealso a show of gladiators, in which twenty-five pairsfought. Marcus Aurelius Cotta, one of the ten com­missioners for keeping the books of the Sibyl, died,and Manius Acilius Glabrio was substituted in hisroom. It happened that both the curule ediles, latelychosen, were persons who could not immediately un­dertake the office: for Caius Cornelius Cethegus wasabsent when he was elected, being then commander inSpain; and Caius Valerius Flaccus, who was present,being flamen Dialis, could not take the oath of ob­serving the laws; and no person was allowed to holdany office longer than five days without taking the.oath. Flaccus petitioned to be excused from comply­ing with the law, on which the senate decreed that ifthe edile produced a person approved of by the con­suls, who would take the oath for him, the consuls, ifthey thought proper, should make application to thetribunes, that it might be proposed to the people. Lu­cius Valerius Flaccus, pretor elect, was produced toswear for his brother.

If Publius Scipio should have al­ready passed over into Africa, that in such case thetribunes of the commons and the edile, with two of thedeputies whom the pretor should judge fittest, shouldimmediately proceed thither: the tribunes and theedile to bring back Scipio from thence; the deputiesto command the forces until a new general should beappointed. But if Marcus Pomponius and the tendeputies should discover that those severities had notbeen committed, either by the order or with the ap­probation of Publius Scipio, that then Scipio shouldremain with the army, and carry on the war as he hadproposed.' A decree of the senate having passed tothis effect, application was made to the tribunes of thecommons to settle among themselves, or choose by lot,which two were to go with the pretor and deputies.The college of pontiffs was consulted about the expia­tions to be performed on account of the spoliation inthe temple of Proserpine at Locri. Marcus ClaudiusMarcellus and Marcus Cincius Alimentus, tribunes ofthe commons, accompanied the pretor and the ten de­puties; with whom an edile of the commons was alsosent. The instructions were, that should Scipio (whe­ther in Sicily or Africa) refuse to obey the orders ofthe pretor, the tribunes were to give directions to theedile to apprehend and bring him home, under the au­thority of their inviolable office. It was intended thatthey should proceed first to Locri, and then to Messana.

Concerning Pleminius, there are two differentaccounts: some say, that on hearing what had passedat Rome, he was going to Naples into exile, when hehappened to meet Quintus Metellus, one of the depu­ties, and was by him forcibly carried back to Rhegium;others, that Scipio himself had sent a lieutenant-gene­ral, with thirty of the most distinguished among thecavalry, to throw Pleminius into chains, and also theprincipals in the mutiny.

On this the king, dividing bis army, sentPhilocles with one part to Athens, and went himselfwith the other to Piraeus; that while his general, byadvancing to the walls and threatening an assault,should keep the Athenians within the city, he mightbe able to make himself master of the harbor, whichhe supposed would be left with only a slight garrison.But he found the attack of Pirasus no less difficultthan that of Eleusis, the same persons acting in itsdefence. He therefore hastily led his troops to Athens,and being repulsed by a sudden sally of both foot andhorse, who engaged him in the narrow ground, in­closed by the half-ruined wall, which, with two arms,joins Piraeus to Athens, he laid aside the scheme ofattacking the city, and, dividing his forces again withPhilocles, set out to complete the devastation of thecountry. As, in his former ravages, he had employedhimself in levelling the sepulchres round the city, sonow, not to leave any thing unviolated, he ordered thetemples of the gods, of which they had one conse­crated in every village, to be demolished and burned.The country of Attica afforded ample matter for theexercise of this barbarous rage; for it was highly em­bellished with works of that kind, having plenty ofmarble, and abounding with artists of exquisite inge­nuity.

The king at first fled with precipitation, andwithout looking behind him; but afterwards, when hehad proceeded as far as five miles, he began, from re­collecting the unevenness of the road, to suspect (whatwas really the case) that the enemy could not fol­low him; and halting, he despatched his attendantsthrough all the hills and valleys to collect the strag­glers together. His loss was not more than two thou­sand men. The rest of his army coming to one spot,as if they had followed some signal, marched off in acompact body towards Thessaly. The Romans, afterhaving pursued the enemy as far as they could withsafety, killing such as they overtook, and despoilingthe slain, seized and plundered the king's camp; towhich, even when there were no troops to opposethem, they could not easily make their way. Thefollowing night they were lodged within their owntrenches.
13. Next day the consul pursued the enemy throughthe same defiles, following the course of the river as itwinds through the valleys. The king came first to thecamp of Pyrrhus, a place so called in Triphylia, a dis­trict of Melotis; and on the following day, by a verylong march, his fears urging him on, he reachedMount Lingos. This ridge of mountains belongs toEpirus, and stretches along between Macedonia andThessaly; the side next to Thessaly faces the east,that next to Macedonia the north. These hills arethickly clad with woods, and on their summits haveopen plains and springs of water. Here Philip re­mained encamped for several days, being unable to de­termine whether he should continue his retreat untilhe arrived in his own dominions, or whether he mightventure back into Thessaly. At length, he resolved todirect his route into Thessaly; and, going by theshortest roads to Tricca, he made hasty excursionsfrom thence to all the cities within his reach. The in­habitants who were able to accompany him he carriedaway, from their habitations, and burned the towns,allowing the owners to take with them such of their

At a time whenyou had so grievous a contest to maintain, and withsuch an antagonist as Hannibal, you sent your consulwith an army into Spain, to collect as it were whatremained of us after a shipwreck. Publius and CneiusCornelius, from the moment of their arrival in the pro­vince, never ceased to pursue measures favorable tous and destructive to our enemies. They first of allregained and gave back to us our city; and sendingpersons to search for our countrymen, who had beensold and dispersed through every part of Spain, theyrestored them from slavery to liberty. When, afterexperiencing the utmost wretchedness, we were nearbeing happily settled, your commanders, Publius andCneius Cornelius, fell, more to be lamented in somemeasure by us even than by you. Then, indeed, it ap­peared as if we had been called from distant places toour original residence only that we might be a secondtime ruined; only that we might see a second destruc­tion of our country. That, to accomplish this, therewas no occasion for an army of Carthaginians; wemight be utterly destroyed by our oldest and mostinveterate enemies, the Turdulans, who had also beenthe cause of our former calamity. In which conjunc­ture you speedily, and beyond our expectations, sentto us this Publius Scipio, the author of our well-being,the supporter of all our hopes; of whose election to theconsulship our having been eye-witnesses, and ourbeing able to carry home the joyful news to our coun­trymen, render us the happiest of the Saguntines.He, having taken a great number of the towns of your

and having ravaged the lands adjoining, brought uphis fleet from thence to the city; where, having kepthis soldiers on board the ships during the day, he dis­embarked them in the night, and led them on to thatpart of the wall over which the Romans had enteredwhen they took the place; for he had a notion thatthe garrison was not strong, and that, on seeing a hopeof changing masters, some of the townsmen wouldraise a commotion. But those who had fled in a panicfrom the fields had already brought an account of thedispersion of the country people, and the approach ofthe enemy; the fleet also had been observed duringthe day, and it was sufficiently evident that its stationbefore the city had not been chosen without some rea­son. The garrison were therefore drawn up and keptunder arms withinside the gate which looks toward thebasin and the sea. The enemy rushing on in a tumul­tuous manner, with crowds of seamen mixed amongthe soldiers, advanced to the walls with more noisethan strength; when the Romans, suddenly throwingopen the gate, rushed forth with a shout, and havingdisordered and repulsed the motley band at the firstonset and discharge of their darts, pursued them withgreat slaughter to the coast; nor would one of themhave survived the battle and the pursuit, had not thevessels, warping close to the shore, received them asthey fled in dismay. Those on ship-board also werenot without their share of the confusion, occasioned bythe drawing up of the ladders, lest the enemy shouldforce in along with their own men, and in cutting awaytheir cables and anchors to avoid the delay of weighingthem. Many, in attempting to swim to the ships, asthey could not in the declining light distinguish whi­ther they ought to direct their course, or what toavoid, met a miserable death. Next day, when thefleet had fled back to the mid-ocean, there were foundbetween the wall and the shore eight hundred menslain, and two thousand stands of arms.

command of that province in the same manner as theyhad held it the year before. The consuls gave direc­tions for a levy of soldiers, out of whom they might atonce form the new legions for Brnttium, and fill upthe numbers of the other armies; for such were theorders of the senate.
14. Africa had not yet been publicly declared a pro­vince—the senate, I suppose, keeping the matter se­cret, lest the Carthaginians should get intelligence ofit. The city, however, was filled with sanguine hopesthat a decisive blow would soon be struck on thatshore, and that there would be an end to the Punicwar. From this cause arose abundance of supersti­tious notions; and the minds of the people becamedisposed both to believe and to propagate accounts ofprodigies, of which a very great number were re­ported: 'that two suns had been seen, and that in thenight-time light had suddenly appeared: that at Setiaa blaze like that of a torch had been observed, ex­tending from east to west: that at Tarracina a gate,and at Anagnia, both a gate and several parts of thewall had been struck by lightning: that in the templeof Juno Sospita, at Lanuvium, a great noise had beenbeard, succeeded by a dreadful crash.' For the ex­piation of these, there was a supplication of one day'scontinuance; and nine days were set apart for reli­gious offices, on account of a shower of stones thathad fallen. In addition to these matters, they had toconsult on the reception to be given to the Ideeanmother. For, besides the account brought by MarcusValerius, (one of the ambassadors who had come be­fore the rest,) that the goddess would soon be in Italy,a late account had been received that she was at Tar­racina. The senate also was engaged in the decisionof a question of no trifling importance—who was thebest man in the city? A well-grounded preference inthat point, every one would certainly value muchmore highly than any honors which could be conferredby the votes either of the senate or the people.

ing their city by force, which was put into his handsby the treachery of Philocles; while Nabis insisted,that he had been invited by the Argives themselves toafford them protection. The king required a generalassembly of the Argives to be convened, that the truthof that matter might be known. To this the tyrant didnot object; but the king alleged that the Lacedaemo­nian troops ought to be withdrawn from the city, inorder to render the assembly free; and that the peopleshould be left at liberty to declare their real senti­ments. This was refused, and the debate produced noeffect. To the Roman general six hundred Cretanswere given by Nabis, who agreed with the pretor ofthe Achaeans to a cessation of arms for four months,and then the conference broke up. Quintius proceededto Corinth, advancing to the gates with the cohort ofCretans, in order to show Philocles, the governor ofthe city, that the tyrant had deserted the cause ofPhilip. Philocles came out to confer with the Romangeneral; and, on the latter exhorting him to changesides immediately, and surrender the city, he answeredin such a manner as showed an inclination rather todefer, than to refuse the matter. From Corinth, Quin­tius sailed over to Anticyra, and sent his brother thenceto sound the disposition of the people of Acarnania.Attalus went from Argos to Sicyon. Here, on oneside, the state added new honors to those formerlypaid to the king; and, on the other, the king, besideshaving on a former occasion redeemed for them, at avast expense, a piece of land sacred to Apollo, un­willing to pass by the city of his friends and allieswithout a token of munificence, made them a presentof ten talents of silver,i and ten thousand bushels ofcorn, and then returned to Cenchreae to his fleet.Nabis, leaving a strong garrison at Argos, returned toLacedaemon; and, as be himself had pillaged the men,he sent his wife to Argos to pillage the women.

every particular, he gave them an escort back to Han­nibal. Hannibal received no pleasure from any oftheir accounts. They informed him that Masinissa hap­pened to arrive that very day with six thousand foot,and four thousand horse; and he was particularlystruck by the confidence of the enemy, which, he wellknew, was not conceived without reason. Wherefore,although he was himself the cause of the war, and had,by his coming, occasioned the violation of the truce,and the breaking off the negotiations; yet, thinkingthat he might obtain-more reasonable terms, by suing-for peace while his strength was intire, than after beingdiscomfited, he sent a message to Scipio, requesting aconference. Whether he took this step on his ownjudgment or by the order of the government, I cannottake on me to affirm. Valerius Antias says that afterhe had been defeated by Scipio in the first engagement,in which twelve thousand fighting men were slain, andone thousand seven hundred taken, he came as ambas­sador, with ten others, into the camp to Scipio. Scipiodid not decline the conference; and the two generals,by concert, moved forward their camps, in order thatthey might (he more conveniently meet. Scipio satdown at a small distance from the city Nedagara, in aspot every way commodious, besides having waterwithin a javelin's cast: Hannibal took possession of ahill, four miles distant; safe and convenient in all re­spects, except that there was no water near. In thespace between them a spot was chosen open to viewon all sides, that there might be no room for treachery.
30. Their armed attendants having retired to anequal distance on both sides, here met (each attendedby a single interpreter) the two greatest generals, notonly of the age they lived in, but of all who have beenrecorded in any former time, and equal to any of thekings or commanders of any nations whatever. Onsight of each other they both stood for some timesilent, struck dumb as it were by mutual admiration.At length Hannibal began thus: ' Since it has been soordered by fate, that I, who first commenced hostilities

the senate ratified and approved it.' They then or­dered the pretor to prepare the following presents forthe king:—two purple rohes with a golden clasp andvests, with broad purple borders; two horses withtrappings; two suits of horseman's armor, with coatsof mail; with tents and camp furniture, such as iscustomary to provide for a consul. Donatives werealso voted for the ambassadors, not less than five thou­sand asses i to each; for their attendants a thousandasses;2 two suits of apparel to each of the ambassa­dors, one to each of their attendants, and the same tothe Numidians, who were to be freed from imprison­ment, and sent back to the king. Besides which, theyordered intire suites of apartments and entertainmentfor the embassy.
18. In the course of the summer, during which thosetransactions passed in Africa, and these decrees atRome, Publius Quintilius Varus, pretor, and MarcusCornelius, proconsul, fought a pitched battle with Ma-go the Carthaginian, in the country of the InsubrianGauls. The pretor's legions were in the first line;Cornelius kept his in reserve, placing himself in thefront. The pretor and proconsul exhorted the soldiersto make the attack with the utmost vigor. Findingthat they made no impression on the Carthaginianline, Quintilius said to Cornelius, ' The battle flags, asyou may perceive; and the enemy, finding themselvesable to make resistance beyond what they had hoped,are hardened against fear, and it is well if they do notassume boldness: we must bear down with the ca­valry, if we expect to disorder or drive them fromtheir ground. Do you therefore support the battle infront, and I will bring up the horse; or I will takecare of matters here, while you charge with the ca­valry of the four legions.' The proconsul offering toundertake either part of the business, as the pretorshould direct, Quintilius the pretor, with his son Mar­cus, a youth of a high and ardent spirit, took the com-

a vast quantity of com, which Scipio had sent fromAfrica, was distributed by them to the people, withstrict impartiality and general satisfaction, at the rateof four asses a peck. The plebeian games were thricerepeated intire by the plebeian ediles, Lucius Apus-tius Fullo and Quintns Minucius Rufns; the latterof whom was, from the edileship, elected pretor.There was also a feast of Jove on occasion of thegames.
5. In the year five hundred and fifty-two from thebuilding of the city, [A.U.C. 552. B.C. 200] PubliusSulpicius Galba and Caius Aurelius being consuls,within a few months after the conclusion of the peacewith the Carthaginians, war began against king Philip.This was the first business introduced by the consul,Publius Sulpicius, on the ides of March, the day onwhich, in those times, the consuls entered into office;and the senate decreed that the consuls should per­form sacrifices with the greater victims to such gods asthey should judge proper, with prayers to this pur­pose :—that ' the business which the senate and peopleof Rome had then under deliberation, concerning thestate, and the entering on a new war, might be attendedwith success and prosperity to the Roman people, theallies, and the Latine confederacy ;' and that, after thesacrifices and prayers, they should consult the senateon the state of public affairs and the provinces. Atthis time, very opportunely for promoting a war, theletters were brought from Marcus Aurelius, the am­bassador, and Marcus Valerius Laevinus, propretor.An embassy likewise arrived from the Athenians, toacquaint them that the king was approaching theirfrontiers, and that in a short time not only their lands,but their city also, must fall into his hands, unlessthey received aid from the Romans. When the con­suls had made their report that the sacrifices had beenduly performed, and that the gods had accepted theirprayers; that the aruspices had declared that the en­trails showed good omens, and that enlargement ofterritory, victory, and triumph were portended, the

sending directions to those who were in the lesser cita­del to take care of themselves, he decamped by night.On which, setting fire to the houses there, in order toobstruct any operations of the enemy, they hastenedaway, as if flying from a pursuit, and overtook themain body of their army at the close of day.
8. When Scipio saw both citadel and camp de­serted by the enemy, he summoned the Locrensians toan assembly, rebuked them severely for their revolt,inflicted punishment on the chief promoters of it, andbestowed their effects on the leaders of the oppositefaction, as a reward for their extraordinary fidelity to­wards the Romans. As to the community of the Lo­crensians, he said, ' he would neither make any grantto them, nor take any thing from them. Let themsend ambassadors to Rome, where they would obtainsuch a settlement of their affairs as the senate shouldjudge reasonable. Of this he was confident, that,though they had deserved harsh treatment from thegreatly provoked Romans, they would yet enjoy abetter state in subjection to them, than under theirprofessed friends the Carthaginians.' Then, leavingQuintus Pleminius, lieutenant-general, with the troopswhich had taken the citadel, to defend the city, he re­turned to Messana with the forces which he hadbrought from thence. The Locrensians, after theirrevolt from the Romans, had been treated by the Car­thaginians with such haughtiness and cruelty, thatthey could now have endured a lesser degree of seve­rity not only with patience, but almost with content.But in all excesses, so much did Pleminius surpassHamilcar, who had commanded their garrison, and theRoman soldiers the Carthaginians, that there seemedto be a greater emulation between them in vices than inarms. Not one of those acts, which render the powerof a superior odious to the helpless, was left unprac­tised on the inhabitants by the commander or his troops:the roost shocking insults were offered to their persons,to their children, and to their wives.

42. Hannibal bad not yet come out of bis camp,when he heard the shouts of the troops engaged:alarmed at this, he led his forces with all speed to­wards the enemy. The charge of the Roman cavalryhad already distressed his van, and, of their infantry, thefirst legion and the right wing were coming into action,while the Carthaginians, without any regular order,began the fight just as chance threw each in the way ofeither horseman or footman. The combatants on bothsides were sustained by reinforcements; and Hanni­bal, in the midst of the terror and tumult, would haveformed his line while fighting, which is no easy matter,unless to a veteran commander, and in the case of ve­teran troops, but that the shout of the cohorts andcompanies, running down from the hills, and whichwas heard on their rear, struck them with the fear ofbeing cut off from their camp; and had it not beennear, (seized as they were with a panic, and flying inevery part,) very great numbers would have beenslain: for the cavalry stuck close to their rear, andthe cohorts, running down the declivity of the hills,over clear and level ground, assailed them in flank.However, upwards of eight thousand men were killed,more than seven hundred men made prisoners, andnine military standards were taken. Even of the ele­phants, which in such a sudden and irregular actionhad been of no use, four were killed, and two taken.Of the Romans and their allies there fell about fivehundred. Next day the Carthaginian kept himselfquiet. The Roman brought his army into the field,and when he saw that none came out to meet him, heordered the spoils of the slain to be collected, and thebodies of his own men to be brought together andburied. After this, for several successive days, hepushed up so close to the enemy's gates, that heseemed to intend an assault; but, at length, Hannibaldecamped, at the third watch of the night, and madetowards Apulia, leaving a great number of fires andtents on the side of the camp which faced the enemy,and a few Numidians, who were to show themselves

Hanno, having received the newly raised bodyof cavalry, (which, so far from being strong enoughto make any attempt on the enemy, was not even suffi­cient to protect the country from devastation,) made ithis first care to increase their number by pressing.Those of other nations were not rejected; but he col­lected mostly N umidians, who are by far the best horse­men in Africa. Having got together four thousand horse,he took up his quarters in a city called Salera', fifteenmiles from the Roman camp. When this was told toScipio, he said, with surprise, ' What! cavalry lodg­ing in houses during the summer! Let them be evenmore in number, while they have such a commander.'The less they showed of activity, the less time hethought should be lost by himself; he therefore sentforward Masinissa with the cavalry, giving them di­rections to ride up to the gates, and entice the enemyout to battle. That when their multitudes should pourout, and become too powerful in the contest, heshould give way by degrees; and that he would him­self come up in time to support the fight. When theadvanced party had, as he supposed, effected his pur­pose, he followed with the Roman horse, and pro­ceeded, without being observed, under cover of somerising grounds which lay very conveniently round thewindings of the road. Masinissa, according to theplan laid down, acted at one time as if threatening anassault, at another as if seized with fear; now ridingup to the very gates, and now retreating with dissem­bled haste, which gave such boldness to the enemy,that they were at length tempted to come out of thetown, and pursue him, with disorder, in his counter­feited flight. All however had not come forth; andwith these remaining numbers the commander was nota little perplexed. Some, overpowered with wine andsleep, he had to compel to the taking of arms; othershe had to stop who were running out by the gateswithout their standards, and in scattered parties,wholly regardless of order or ranks.

But whatis past, however it may be blamed, cannot be retrieved.Our attempts on the possessions of others have endedin our being necessitated to fight in defence of ourown.

were terminated. Much I dread lest you quickly feelthat the subject of your tears this day is the lightest ofyour misfortunes.' Such were Hannibal's sentimentswhich he delivered to the Carthaginians. Scipio, hav­ing called an assembly, bestowed on Masinissa, in ad­dition to his paternal kingdom, the city of Cirtha, andthe other cities and lands belonging to the territoriesof Syphax, which had fallen into the hands of the Ro­man people. He ordered Cneius Octavius to conductthe fleet to Sicily, and deliver it to the consul CneinsCornelius; and the ambassadors of the Carthaginiansto go to Rome, in order that the terms stipulated forby him might be ratified by the authority of the senateand the order of the people.

Peace being established by sea and land, he em­barked his army, and carried it over to Lilybasum inSicily; and from thence, sending a great part of histroops round by sea, he himself landed in Italy. Ashe proceeded through the country, he found it no lessdelighted at finding there was an end to the war, thanat the success in it; not only the inhabitants of thecities pouring out to show their respect to him, butcrowds of the country-people also filling up the roads:and thus he arrived at Rome, where he entered thecity in the most splendid triumph which had ever beenbeheld. He carried into the treasury a hundred andtwenty-three thousand pounds weight of silver, andout of the spoil distributed to each of his soldiers fourhundred asses.i The death of Syphax caused somediminution in the splendor of the show, but none inthe glory of the general who triumphed. He died ashort time before at Tibur, to which place he had beenremoved from Alba. His death, however, made somenoise, for he was honored with a public funeral.

23. This severity, executed by an enraged enemyon those who opposed them in arms, especially as theywere at the time engaged in hostilities with anotherpeople, was not inconsistent with the laws of war.But the more shocking havoc was in the city, wherea weak unarmed crowd of women and children wereassailed by their own countrymen, who tossed theiralmost lifeless bodies on the burning pile, while streamsof blood kept down the rising flames, and who at last,wearied with the wretched slaughter of their friends,cast themselves with their arms] into the midst of thefire. Just as the carnage was completed the victoriousRomans arrived. On the first sight of such a horridtransaction, they were for a time struck motionlesswith astonishment; hut afterwards, on seeing the goldand silver glittering between the heaps of other mat­ters, with the greediness natural to mankind, theywished to snatch them out of the burning heap. Inattempting this, some were caught by the flames,others scorched by blasts of the heat, the foremostfinding it impracticable to make a retreat against thepress of so great a crowd. Thus was Astapa utterlydestroyed by fire and sword, and without enriching thesoldiers with booty. All the other inhabitants of thatdistrict, terrified at this event, made their submissions.Marcius led back his victorious army to join Scipioat Carthage.

While they apologised forthis act, alleging that it had been done by a part of themultitude, who were offended because some of theireffects had been carried off by the soldiers when theywere embarking, he enticed their suffetes,i which is thename of the chief magistracy among the Carthaginians,and their treasurer to a conference; and then orderedthem to be crucified, after they had been mangled withstripes. From thence he sailed to the island Pityusa,3about one hundred miles from the continent, inhabitedat that time by Carthaginians, where the fleet was re­ceived in a friendly manner, and supplied not onlywith abundance of provisions, but with a reinforce­ment of young men and arms. Emboldened by thesesuccors, the Carthaginian proceeded to the Balearicislands, about fifty miles distant. There are two of theBaleares ;3 one larger and more powerful in men andarms than the other, and which has also a harbor,where he believed he might pass the winter commodi-ously, as it was now the latter end of autumn.

For a verylong time the people interfered but little with the administra­tion of public affairs; but afterwards, by means of factionsand cabals, they almost intirely engrossed it to themselies,which proved a principal cause of their ruin. They had acouncil consisting of one hundred and four members, calledthe tribunal of the hundred, to which the commanders ofarmies were responsible for their conduct.

The senate resolved, conformably to the opinion ofManius Acilius, that the town should be secured by agarrison, and all the Tareutines confined within thewalls, and that the business should be taken underconsideration at a future time, and when Italy shouldbe in a state of greater tranquillity. The case of Mar­cus Livius, governor of the citadel of Tarentum, wasalso debated with no less warmth: some advised topass a vote of censure on him, because that, in conse­quence of his indolence, Tarentum had been betrayedto the enemy; while others thought him deserving ofreward, for having defended the citadel for five years,and for having, singly, been the principal cause of therecovery of Tarentum. Moderate people affirmedthat the cognisance of his conduct belonged to thecensors, not to the senate; and of this opinion wasFabius; nevertheless adding—' Livius was, no doubt,the cause of Tarentum being recovered, as his friendshave so often boasted in the senate; but it should beborne in mind that it could not have been recoveredif it had not been lost.' The consul, Titus QuintiusCrispinus, marched with a reinforcement into Lucania,to join the army formerly commanded by QuintnsFulvius Flaccus. Marcellus was detained by severalobstacles respecting religion, which occurred in quicksuccession to disturb his mind: one of which was, that,having in the battle with the Gauls at Clastidiumvowed a temple to Honor and Virtue, he had beenhindered by the pontiffs from dedicating it, for theyinsisted that one shrine could not with propriety beconsecrated to more than one deity; because, if itshould be struck with lightning, or any kind of pro­digy happen in it, the expiation would be difficult, asit could not be determined to which of the deities sa­crifice ought to be made; for one victim could not,properly, be offered to two divinities, unless they wereknown to be two to whom such victim must be accept­able. Wherefore a separate temple was erected toVirtue, and the work pushed forward with haste:nevertheless these temples were not dedicated by him.

As soon as day ap­peared the Roman army came up to the trenches, theNumidians, as, directed, showing themselves for sometime on the ramparts: having imposed on the enemyas Jong as possible, they rode off at full speed, untilthey overtook the body of their army» The consul,perceiving the camp perfectly silent, and no longerseeing any where even the small number who had pa­raded in view, at the dawn of day despatched twohorsemen to examine the state of the works; andwhen he learned with certainty that all was safe, heordered his army to march in.

Next day, at the first light,he set out, and following by long marches the tracksof the Carthaginians by such intelligence as he couldprocure, overtook them not far from Venusia. Herelikewise an irregular kind of battle was fought, inwhich above two thousand of the fugitives fell. Fromthence, Hannibal, marching in the night, and takinghis way through mountains, that he might not beforced to an engagement, proceeded towards Meta-pontum: from which place Hanno, who commandedthe garrison of the town, was sent with a small partyinto Bruttium to raise fresh forces; while Hannibal,with the addition of the garrison to his own troops,went back to Venusia by the same roads throughwhich he had come, and thence to Canusium. Nerohad never quitted the enemy's steps, and when he wasgoing himself to Metapontum, had sent orders toQuintus Fnlvius to come into Lucania, lest that coun­try should be left without defence.
43. In the mean time Hasdrubal, having raised thesiege of Placentia, sent four Gallic horsemen, and twoNumidians, with a letter for Hannibal; these aftertraversing almost the whole length of Italy, throughthe midst of enemies, in order to follow him on hisretreat to Metapontum, mistook the road, and went to­wards Tarentum, where they were seized by some

20. About the same time Lucius Cornelius Lentu-lus, proconsul, came home from Spain; and havinglaid before the senate an account of his brave and suc­cessful conduct, during the course of many years, de­manded that he might be allowed to enter the city intriumph. The senate, on this, gave their opinion, that'his services were, indeed, deserving of a triumph;but that they had no precedent left them by their an­cestors, of any person enjoying a triumph, who wasnot, at the time of performing the service, on accountof which he claimed that honor, either dictator, con­sul, or pretor; that he had held the province of Spainin quality of proconsul, and not of consul, or pretor.'They determined however that he might enter the cityin ovation. Against this Tiberius Sempronius Lon-gus, tribune of the people, protested, alleging, thatsuch proceedings would be no less unprecedented, andcontrary to the practice of their ancestors, than theother; but, overcome at length by the unanimous de­sire of the senate, the tribune withdrew his opposition,and Lucius Lentulus entered the city in ovation. Hecarried to the treasury forty-four thousand poundsweight of silver, and two thousand four hundred poundsweight of gold. To each of the soldiers he distributed,of the spoil, one hundred and twenty asses.i
21. The consular army had by this time removedfrom Arretium to Ariminum, and the five thousandLatine confederates had gone from Gaul into Etruria.Lucius Furius therefore advanced from Ariminum, byforced marches, against the Gauls, who were then be­sieging Cremona, and pitched his camp at the distanceof one mile and a half from the enemy.

by refusing me supplies both of men and money. Itis not the Roman people, so often discomfited, androuted, that has conquered Hannibal, but the Cartha­ginian senate, through the malicious suggestions ofenvy; nor will Scipio exult and pride himself somuch in this my disgraceful retreat, as will Hanno;who, unable to do it by any other means, has crushedour family under the ruins of Carthage.' As he hadfor some time foreseen this event, he had ships alreadyprepared: dismissing therefore a useless crowd ofsoldiers, under the appearance of garrisons, into thetowns of Bruttium, a few of which adhered to him ra­ther through fear than affection, he carried over toAfrica such of the troops as were fit for service. Agreat number of natives of Italy, refusing to followhim to Africa, and flying to the sanctuary of JunoLacinia, which, till that day, had never been violated,were barbarously put to death within the walls of thetemple. We are told, that hardly any person evershowed more grief on leaving his native soil to go intoexile, than Hannibal on his departure from the coun­try of his enemy; that he often looked back on thecoasts of Italy, inveighing against gods and men, ut­tering curses on his own head for not having led hismen to Rome, yet reeking with blood from the slaugh­ter at Cannx: reflecting, with the bitterest vexation,that Scipio, who since his appointment to the consul­ship, had not looked in the face of the Carthaginianenemy in Italy, had yet spirit to go and attack Car­thage; while he, who had slain a hundred thousandfighting men at Thrasymenus and Cannae, had sufferedbis strength to moulder away about Casilinum, Cuma?,and Nola. In the midst of such self-reproaches and com­plaints, he was forced away from Italy, in which he hadso long maintained a divided power with the Romans.

manner for a long time, yet the ambassadors were notin the least moved, but replied, that ' they had nothingnew to represent to the senate at home, neither hadthat assembly grounds for new deliberation, when theyneither had men to be enlisted, nor money to pay them.'The consuls finding them inflexible, laid the affair beforethe senate: and here it excited such serious apprehen­sions in every mind, that great numbers cried out, that'the ruin of the empire was at hand; that the othercolonies would act in the same manner; so would theallies; that all had conspired to betray the city ofRome to Hannibal.'
10. The consuls endeavored to console and encouragethe senate, telling them ' the other colonies would main­tain their allegiance and duty as heretofore; and thateven these which had swerved from their duty, if am­bassadors were sent round among them instructed toapply reproofs, and not intreaties, would be impressedwith respect for the sovereign authority.' Having re­ceived power from the senate to act and manage asthey should see most conducive to the public good,they began by sounding the dispositions of the othercolonies; and then, summoning their ambassadors, de­manded of them in public, whether they had their con­tingents of soldiers ready according to the regulation?To this Marcus Sextilius of Fregellae, in behalf of theeighteen colonies, made answer that ' the soldiers wereready according to the regulation; that if a greaternumber should be required, they would bring them;and, that whatever else the Roman people should com­mand or wish, they would perform with zeal and dili­gence. That they wanted not sufficiency of means, andhad more than a sufficiency of inclination.' On thisthe consuls, after premising that all the praises whichthemselves could bestow would be inadequate to theirmerits, unless they were joined by the thanks of thewhole body of the senate in full assembly, desired themto accompany them into the senate-house.

24. While the naval forces were thus employed, theconsul, having encamped before Elatia, in Pbocis, firstendeavored, by conferring with the principal inhabi­tants, to bring them over, and by their means to effecthis purpose; but on their answering that they had no­thing in their power, because the king's troops weremore numerous and stronger than the townsmen, beassaulted the city on all sides at once with arms andengines. A battering-ram shattered a part of the wallthat reached from one tower to another, and this fall­ing with a prodigious noise and crash, left much of thetown exposed. On this a Roman cohort made an as­sault through the breach, while at the same time thetownsmen, quitting their several posts, ran togetherfrom all parts to the endangered place. Others of theRomans climbed over the ruins of the wall, and broughtup scaling-ladders to the parts that were standing. Asthe conflict attracted the eyes and attention of the enemyto one particular spot, the walls were scaled in severalplaces, by which means the soldiers easily entered thetown. The noise and tumult which ensued so terrifiedthe enemy, that quitting the place which they hadcrowded together to defend, they all fled in panic tothe citadel, accompanied by the unarmed multitude.The consul having thus become master of the town,gave it up to be plundered, and then sent a messengerinto the citadel, offering the king's troops their lives,on condition of their laying down their arms and de­parting. To the Elatians he offered their liberty;which terms being agreed to, in a few days after hegot possession of the citadel.

At length they were reducedto order by the magistrates, and obliged to make room,that the joyful tidings might be regularly imparted tothe public, who were unable to govern their trans­ports. The dispatch was accordingly read, first inthe senate, then in the assembly of the people; someembracing the joyful news as certain, while othersrefused to credit any thing until they should hear itfrom the deputies, or the letters of the consuls.
51. After some time an account was brought thatdeputies were really coming, and not far off. On this,people of all ages ran out eagerly to meet them, eachcoveting to receive, from his own eyes and ears, con­vincing proofs of the reality of such a happy event.One continued train reached all the way to the Mul-vian bridge: the deputies were, Lucius VeturiusPhilo,Publius Licinius Varus, and Quintus Caecilius Me-tellus. Surrounded by a vast multitude of every sort,they went on to the forum, while some inquired ofthem, others of their attendants, concerning what hadbeen done; and as soon as any one heard that theenemy's general and army had been cut off, that theRoman legions were safe, and the consuls unhurt, heimmediately communicated his own joy to others.When the deputies had, with much difficulty, reachedthe senate-house, and the crowd was, with muchgreater difficulty, obliged to retire, that they mightnot mix with the senators, the letters were read in thesenate; and then the deputies were brought out intothe general assembly.

If foreigners^ who areseparated from us to a greater distance by their lan­guage, manners, and laws, than by the length of seaand land, are allowed to get footing here, it is madnessto hope that any thing will continue in its presentstate. Does your liberty appear to be in any degreeof danger from the government of Philip, who at atime when he was justly incensed, demanded nothingmore of you than peace; and at present requires nomore than the observance of the peace which heagreed to? Accustom foreign legions to these coun­tries, and receive the yoke; too late and in vain willyou look for an alliance with Philip, when you willhave become a property of the Romans. Triflingcauses occasionally unite and disunite the JEtolians,Acarnanians, and Macedonians, men speaking thesame language. With foreigners, with barbarians, allGreeks have, and ever will have, eternal war; be­cause they are enemies by nature, which is always thesame, and not from causes which change with thetimes. I conclude my discourse with the same argu­ment with which I began. Three years since, thesame persons, assembled in this same place, deter­mined on peace with the same Philip, contrary to theinclinations of the same Romans, who now wish thatthe peace should be broken, after it has been ad­justed and ratified. In the subject of your delibera­tion fortune has made no change; why you shouldmake any, I do not see.'

and Numidians then fairly turned their hacks; andthough at first they retreated in troops, and withoutbreaking their ranks, yet when the Romans fell furi­ously on their rear they thought no more of order, butfled precipitately, and dispersed into such places aseach found convenient. Although by this battle thespirits of the Romans were somewhat raised, and thoseof the enemy depressed, yet for several following daysthe horsemen and light troops were continually en­gaged in skirmishes.
14. After making trial of their strength in theseslight engagements, Hasdrubal led out his forces tothe field; then the Romans marched out. Both armiesstood in order of battle under their respective ram­parts, neither party choosing to begin the attack ; whenit was near sunset, the Carthaginians first, and then theRomans, marched back into camp. They acted in thesame manner for several days, the Carthaginian al­ways drawing out his troops first, and first giving thesignal of retreat, when they were fatigued with stand­ing. Neither side advanced in the least, nor was aweapon discharged, nor a word uttered. The centredivisions of their lines were composed, on one side, ofRomans; on the other of Carthaginians and Africanauxiliaries: the wings were formed by the allies, whoon both sides were Spaniards. In front of the Cartha­ginian line the elephants at a distance appeared likecastles. It was now generally said in both camps thatthey were to engage in the same order in which theyhad stood before; and that their centres, consisting ofRomans and Carthaginians, who were principals inthe war, would no doubt encouuter each other withequal courage and strength of arms. When Scipiounderstood that this opinion was firmly entertained, hetook care to alter the whole plan against the day onwhich he intended to fight. On the preceding evening,therefore, he gave out orders through the camp thatthe men and horses should be refreshed and accoutredbefore day; and that the horsemen, ready armed, shouldkeep.their horses bridled and saddled.

Nextday advanced two by far the most illustrious generals,and two most puissant armies, of the two most power­ful states, to complete the splendid fabric of glorywhich they had erected, and which each was desirousof securing to himself. The minds of all were anxi­ously suspended between hope and fear; and, whilstthey viewed at one time their own, at another theenemy's army, estimating their powers either by theeye or judgment, they met with objects both of encou­ragement and of dread. Such as did not occur to theirown thoughts were suggested by the generals in theiradmonitions and exhortations. The Carthaginian re­counted the exploits of sixteen years in the heart ofItaly; so many Roman generals, so many armies ut­terly destroyed; and when he came to any soldierwho had been distinguished for his behavior in a for­mer battle, he reminded him of the honors which hahad received. Scipio called to his men's recollectionSpain, the late engagements in Africa, and the ac-knowlegement of the enemy, that they had been com­pelled by their fears to sue for peace; which, yet, thenatural perfidy of their disposition would not allowthem to establish. He related also his conference withHannibal; which, as it had passed in secret, he mighthave misrepresented at his pleasure. He mentioned,as an encouraging omen, that, as they were comingout to battle, the gods had shown them the same por­tents, under the auspices of which their fathers hadfought at the islands /Egates. 'The end of the war,and of all their toils,' he said, 'was now at hand;they had within their reach the plunder of Carthage:and might speedily return home to their country, totheir parents, their children, their wives, and theirhousehold gods.' These words he uttered in an erectattitude, and with a countenance so animated with joy,that he seemed as if he had already obtained the vic­tory.

He has, therefore, representedhimself as a man of gravity and wisdom, who haspassed through every degree of public honors; andme, as below the age even of his son ; as if ambitionextended not its views beyond the present life, and didnot look forward to posterity and future remembranceas the greatest possible reward. I well know that itis usual with persons of exalted merit to comparethemselves with the illustrious men, not only of thepresent, but of every age; and I do not deny, Quin-tus Fabius, that I wish not only to overtake you in therace of glory, but, pardon the expression, to outrunyou, if I can. That disposition of mind will not, Ihope, affect you towards me, nor me towards myjuniors, that we should be displeased if any of ourcountrymen became distinguished like ourselves; forthat would be an injury not only to those who werethe objects of our envy, but to the state, and in somemeasure to all mankind.

The as­sembly was now dismissed, all acknowleging that thereproofs which they had received were not more se­vere than they deserved; for that no person in theRoman army had, that day, behaved like a man, ex­cept the general alone, to whom they ought to makeatonement, either by their death or by a glorious vic­tory. On the day following they attended accordingto orders, armed and accoutred. The general thencommended them, and said, that ' he would bring for­ward, into the first line, those who had fled first theday before, and the cohorts which had lost their stan­dards; that he now gave notice, that it was incumbenton them to fight and to conquer, and to exert them­selves vigorously, one and all, to prevent the news ofyesterday's flight reaching Rome before that of thepresent day's triumph.' They were then ordered torefresh themselves with food, that in case the fight-should last longer than usual, they might have strengthto go through it. After every thing had been said anddone to rouse the courage of the soldiers, they marchedout to the field.
14. When this was told to Hannibal, he said, ' Wehave to deal with an enemy who can neither bear goodfortune nor bad: if he gets the better, he pursues thevanquished with presumption and vehemence: if he isworsted, he renews the contest with the victors.' Hiethen ordered the signal to be sounded, and led outhis forces. Both parties fought now with much morevigor than the day before; the Carthaginians strug­gling to maintain the glory acquired yesterday, theRomans to remove their disgrace. On the side of theRomans, the left wing and the cohorts which had losttheir standards, fought in the front line; while thetwentieth legion was drawn up on the right wing.Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, and Cains Claudius Nero,lieutenants-general, commanded the wings; Marcellushimself took the charge of the centre, that he mightanimate the men by his presence, and be an immediate

ing in the camp, neglecting even to fix guards, whenPhilip unexpectedly came on them. His approachbeing announced by those who had fled out of thefields in a fright, threw Damocritus and the rest of theofficers into great confusion. It happened to be mid­day, and when most of the men, after a hearty meal,lay fast asleep. Their officers roused them, however,as fast as possible; ordered them to take arms; de­spatched some to recall those who were stragglingthrough the fields in search of plunder; and so violentwas their hurry, that many of the horsemen went outwithout their swords, and but few of them put on theircorslets. After marching out in this precipitate man­ner, (the whole horse and foot not amounting to sixhundred,) they met the king's cavalry, superior innumber, in spirit, and in arms. They were thereforerouted at the first charge; and, having scarcely at­tempted resistance, returned to the camp in shamefulflight. Several were slain; and some taken, havingbeen cut off from the main body of the runaways.
42. Philip, when his troops had advanced almost tothe rampart, ordered a retreat to be sounded, becauseboth men and horses were fatigued, not so much bythe action, as by the length of their march, and theextraordinary celerity with which they had made it.He therefore despatched the horsemen by troops, andthe companies of light infantry in turn, for water;after which they took refreshment. The rest he kepton guard, under arms, waiting for the main body ofthe infantry, which had marched with less expedition,on account of the weight of their armor. As soon asthese arrived, they also were ordered to fix their stan­dards, and, laying down their arms before them, totake food in haste; sending two, or at most three, outof each company to provide water. In the mean timethe cavalry and light infantry stood in order, andready, in case the enemy should make any motion.The jEtolians, as if resolved to defend their fortifica­tions, (the multitude which had been scattered aboutthe fields having, by this time, returned to the camp,)

the conqueror's mind was not only subdued to pity, but,as all the Numidians are extremely amorous, the vic­torious king became the slave of his captive ;1 andgiving his right band, as a pledge for the performanceof what she had requested, he went into the palace.Immediately he began to consider within himself bywhat means he might fulfil his engagement; and notbeing able to devise any, he adopted a rash and shame­ful resolution, suggested by his love. He gave ordersthat every thing should be instantly prepared for amarriage on that same day, in order that he mightleave no room for Laelius, or Scipio himself, to pro­ceed against her as a captive, since she would then behis wife. After the marriage was concluded Laeliusarrived; and so far was he from dissembling his dis­approbation of the proceeding, that at first he even re­solved to drag her from the nuptial bed, and send herwith Syphax to Scipio: but he was afterwards pre­vailed on by the intreaties of Masinissa, who besoughthim to leave it to the Romans to determine which ofthe two kings should have Sophonisba a sharer of hisfortune. Sending away, therefore, Syphax and theother prisoners, he reduced, with the assistance ofMasinissa, all the cities of Numidia which were heldby the king's garrisons.
13. When it was announced that the detachmentwas bringing Syphax to the camp, the whole multitudepoured out, as if to the sight of a triumph. He pre­ceded the rest in chains, and was followed by a numberof noble Numidians. On this occasion every one spokein the most exalted terms of the greatness of Syphax,and the fame of his nation; thus exaggerating the re­nown of their victory. 'That was the king,' they said,'to whose dignity the two most powerful states in the
l Sophonisba had been formerly betrothed to Masinissa, andbeing afterwards given to Syphax, was one reason of hisquarrelling with the Carthaginians, and joining the Romans.Another was, that in the contest between him and Mezutu-lus for the throne, his rival had been aided by the Cartha­ginians.

both the booty of cattle and the prisoners, and also apart of his forces, which were more numerous than theremainder of the business required. Then, with nomore than five hundred foot and two hundred horse,pursuing Masinissa, who had gone down from the topof the mountain, he shut him up in a narrow valley,securing the entrance at each end. Great slaughterwas there made of the Massylians; Masinissa, withnot more than fifty horsemen, effected a retreat throughthe intricate passes of the mountain, with which thepursuers were unacquainted. Bocchar, however,closely followed his steps, and overtaking him in auopen plain, near the city Clupea, surrounded himin such a manner that he slew every one of his fol­lowers except four horsemen: Masinissa with these,and after receiving a wound, slipped out of his hands,as it were, during the tumult. Their flight was in fullview, a body of horse being spread over the wholeplain, some of whom pursued these five remainingenemies, while others, in order to meet them, pushedacross their route. A large river lay in the way of thefugitives, into which they plunged their horses with­out hesitation, being pressed by greater danger frombehind. Hurried away by the current, they were car­ried down obliquely; and two of them being swal­lowed by its violent rapidity in sight of the enemy,they believed that Masinissa himself had perished:but, with the two other horsemen, he landed amongsome bushes on the farther bank. This put an end toBocchar's pursuit, for he durst not venture into theriver; and besides, he was persuaded that the objectof it no longer existed; he therefore returned to theking with the ill-grounded report of Masinissa's death.Messengers were despatched with the joyful news toCarthage; though in its spread over Africa men'sminds were variously affected by it.

at the vanquished party presuming to prescribe termsto their conqueror, said, that 'in listening before toproposals of peace, or in agreeing to a truce, he hadnot been led by any expectation that the jEtolianswould remain quiet, but by his wish to have all theconfederates witnesses that the object of his pursuitswas peace; of theirs, war. Thus, without any thingbeing effected towards an accommodation, he dismissedthe assembly, left five thousand soldiers to protect theAchasans, receiving from them five ships of war, withwhich, added to a fleet lately sent to him from Car­thage, and some vessels then on their way from Bithy-nia, sent by king Prusias, he had resolved, if he couldeffect the junction, to try his strength in a naval en­gagement with the Romans, who had long been mastersof the sea in that part of the world. After dissolvingthe council he went back to Argos, because the time ofthe Nemaian games was approaching, and he wishedto give them, by his presence, an additional degree ofsplendor.
31. While the king was employed in the celebrationof the games, and, during that season of festivity, in­dulging his mind in relaxation from military opera­tions, Publius Sulpicius, setting sail from Naupactus,arrived on the coast between Sicyon and Corinth,making violent depredations on that fine and fertilecountry. The news of this event called away Philipfrom the exhibition. He marched off with rapidity atthe head of his cavalry, leaving orders for the infantryto follow; and, while the Romans were straggling atrandom, and heavily laden with booty, not apprehend­ing any danger of the kind, he attacked and drovethem to their ships. Thus the Roman fleet returnedto Naupactus with little cause of triumph for the bootywhich they had taken. On the other side Philip, bythe fame of a victory, whatever might be its real im­portance, gained however over Romans, added greatlyto the lustre of the remaining part of the games; andthe festival was celebrated with extraordinary re­joicings, to which he contributed also by his popular

as these should be engaged in skirmishing, he shouldcharge with the cavalry from a place of concealment.A conveniently projecting mountain covered the am­bush of the cavalry, and the battle began without de­lay; for the Spaniards rushed on the cattle as soonas they saw them at a distance, and the light infantryattacked them, occupied with their booty. At first,they endeavored to terrify each other with missiveweapons; afterwards, having discharged their lightdarts, which were fitter to provoke than to decide thefight, they drew their swords, and began to engagefoot to foot. The contest between the infantry wasdoubtful; but the cavalry came up, who, chargingstraight forward, not only trod down all before them,but some also, wheeling round along the foot of thesteep, fell on the enemy's rear, inclosing the greaterpart of them: so that the number slain was far moreconsiderable than is usual in such kind of engagements.This discomfiture served rather to inflame the rage ofthe barbarians than depress them. In order thereforeto show that they were not dispirited, at the first lighton the day following they led out their troops to battle.The valley being narrow, as has been mentioned, couldnot contain all their forces; so that only about two-thirds of the infantry and all their cavalry came downto the engagement. The remainder of the foot theyposted on a hill on one side. Scipio, judging that thenarrowness of the ground was a favorable circumstanceto him, both because fighting in a confined space seemedbetter suited to the Roman than the Spanish soldier,and also because the enemy could not completely formtheir line, turned his thoughts to a new scheme. Find­ing that he could not extend his cavalry on the wings,and that those of the enemy, whom they had broughtout with the infantry, would be useless, he orderedLaelius to lead the cavalry round the hills by the mostconcealed roads, and to keep separate as much as pos­sible the fight of the cavalry from that between the in­fantry. He himself led forward the battalions of in­fantry, placing four cohorts in front, for he could not

48. A great part of the senate, induced by their re­gard for him, and the importance of his services,showed an inclination to grant his request. The elderpart refused to agree to such grant, both 'because thearmy, with which he had acted, belonged to another;and because he had left his province through an am­bitious desire of snatching that opportunity of pro­curing a triumph, — a conduct altogether unprece­dented.' The senators of consular rank particularlyinsisted, that ' he ought to have waited for the con­sul; for that he might, by pitching his camp near thecity, and thereby securing the colony without comingto an engagement, have protracted the affair until hisarrival; and that, what the pretor had not done, thesenate ought to do; they should wait for the consul.After hearing the business discussed by the consul andpretor in their presence, they would be able, on bettergrounds, to form a judgment on the case.' Great partwere of opinion that they ought to consider nothingbut the service performed, and whether he had per­formed it while in office, and under his own auspices:for, * when of two colonies, which had been opposed,as barriers, to restrain the tumultuous inroads of theGauls, one had been already sacked and burned, theflames being ready to spread (as if from an adjoininghouse) to the other, which lay so near, what ought thepretor to have done?

words when the Roman horse, pushing forwards intothe midst of their ranks, threw the line of infantryinto confusion, and at the same time closed up thepasses by which the Spanish horse were to have ad­vanced to a charge. The Spaniards, therefore, quittingall thoughts of fighting on horseback, dismounted, inorder to engage on foot. When the Roman generalsperceived the enemy's disorder, that they were con­fused and terrified, and their battalions wavering, theyencouraged, they intreated their men, to 'push thembriskly while they were dismayed, and not to suffertheir line to be formed again.' The barbarians couldnot have withstood so furious an onset had not theirprince, Indibilis, dismounting with the cavalry, thrownhimself into the front of the foremost battalions of in­fantry. There the contest was supported for sometime with great fury. At length those who foughtround the king fell, overwhelmed with darts, and hehimself, continuing to make resistance, though readyto expire, was pinned to the earth with a javelin; onwhich their troops betook themselves to flight in all■ parts. The number of the slain was the greater, be­cause the horsemen had not time to remount theirhorses, being vigorously pressed by the Romans, whodid not relax in the least until they had driven themfrom their camp. There fell on that day, of the Spa­niards, thirteen thousand, and about eight hundredwere taken. Of the Romans and their allies, littlemore than two hundred were killed, most of them onthe left wing. The Spaniards who were beaten out ofthe camp, or who had escaped from the battle, at firstdispersed about the country, and afterwards returnedto their respective homes. They were soon after sum­moned thence to an assembly by Mandonius, where,after complaining heavily of their losses, and severelycensuring the advisers of the war, they came to a reso­lution that ambassadors should be sent to Scipio withproposals to make surrender of themselves. Theselaid the blame on Indibilis and the other chiefs, mostof whom had fallen in battle, offering to deliver up

38. Some have found fault with the king, as guiltyof rashness on that day; and with the consul, as nothaving pushed with spirit the advantage which he hadgained: for Philip, they say, on his part, ought tohave avoided coming to action, knowing that in a fewdays the enemy, having exhausted all the adjacentcountry, must be reduced to the extremity of want;and that the consul, after having routed the Macedo­nian cavalry and light infantry, and nearly taken theking himself, ought to have led on his troops directlyto the enemy's camp, where, dismayed as they were,they could have made no stand, and that he mighthave finished the war in a moment's time. This, likemost other matters, was easier in speculation than inpractice: for if the king had brought his infantry intothe engagement, then, indeed, during the tumult, andwhile, vanquished and struck with dismay, they fledfrom the field into their intrenchments, (and even con­tinued their flight from thence on seeing the victoriousenemy mounting the ramparts,) the king's camp mighthave fallen into the Romans' possession. But as theinfantry had remained in the camp, fresh and freefrom fatigue, with outposts before the gates, and guardproperly disposed, what would he have gained in hav­ing imitated the rashness of which the king had justnow been guilty, by pursuing the routed horse? Onthe other side, the king's first plan of an attack on theforagers, while dispersed through the fields, was notinjudicious, could he have satisfied himself with a mo­derate degree of success: and it is the less surprisingthat he should have made a trial of fortune, as therewas a report that Pleuratus and the Dardanians hadmarched with very numerous forces, and had alreadypassed into Macedonia; so that, if he should be sur­

began to concert measures for the siege of Oreus.This city was well secured by fortifications; and also,since the attempt formerly made on it, by a stronggarrison. After the taking of Andros, the combinedfleet had been joined by twenty Rhodian ships, alldecked vessels, under the command of Agesimbrotus.This squadron they sent to cruise off Zelasium, a pro­montory of Isthmia, very conveniently situate beyondDemetrias, in order that, if the ships of the Macedo­nians should attempt to come out, they might be athand to oppose them. Heraclides, the king's admiral,kept his fleet there, rather with a view of laying holdof any advantage which the negligence of the enemymight afford him, than with a design of employing openforce. The Romans and king Attalus carried on theirattacks against Oreus on different sides; the Romansagainst the citadel next to the sea, the king's troops againstthe lower part of the town, lying between the two cita­dels, where the city is also divided by a wall. As theirposts were different, so were their methods of attack:the Romans made their approaches by means of coveredgalleries, some carried by men, others moving on wheels,applying also the ram to the walls; the king's troops,by throwing in weapons with the balista, catapulta, andevery other kind of engine. They cast stones also ofimmense weight, formed mines, and made use of everyexpedient, which, on trial, had been found useful inthe former siege. On the other side, the Macedoniangarrison, in the town and the citadels, was not onlymore numerous than on the former occasion, but ex­erted themselves with greater spirit, in consequence ofthe reprimands which they had received from the kingfor their former misconduct, and also from remembranceboth of his threats and promises with regard to theirfuture behavior; so that there was very little hope ofits being speedily taken. The lieutenant-generalthought that, in the mean time, some other businessmight be accomplished; wherefore, leaving such anumber of men as seemed sufficient to finish the works,he passed over to the nearest part of the continent,

to gratify Scipio, who was then the ohject of universalfavor among all the members of the state. Thereforethither were sent not only from Sardinia, as was men­tioned before, but from Sicily also, and Spain, cloth­ing, corn, and arms, with every other kind of stores;while Scipio relaxed not his diligence during any partof the winter in the operations of war, for which hefound abundant occasion on every side. He was en­gaged in the siege of Utica; Hasdrubal's camp waswithin sight; the Carthaginians had launched theirships, and kept their ffeet equipped, and in readinessto intercept his convoys. Amidst so many objectswhich required his attention, he did not neglect en­deavoring to recover the friendship of Syphax; hopingthat he might now perhaps be cloyed with love in thefull enjoyment of his bride. The answers of Syphaxcontained, chiefly, proposals for an accommodationwith the Carthaginians on the terms of the Romans re­tiring from Africa, and the Carthaginians from Italy;but afforded scarcely any hopes that he would relin­quish his present engagements. I am more inclined tobelieve that this business was transacted by messen­gers, as most authors affirm, than that Syphax came inperson to the Roman camp to a conference, as AntiusValerius writes. At first, the Roman general hardlypermitted those terms to be mentioned by his people;but afterwards, in order that they might have a plau­sible pretext for going frequently into the enemy'scamp, he softened his refusals, even seemingly in­clining to a negotiation. The winter huts of the Car­thaginians were composed almost intirely of timber,which they had hastily collected from the fields: thoseof the Numidians were formed of reeds interwoven,and most of them covered with mats, and dispersed upand down without any regularity, some of them evenon the outside of the trench and rampart, for theywere left to choose their own ground. These circum­stances being related to Scipio, gave him hopes thathe might find au opportunity of burning the enemy'scamp.

his misfortunes, from seeing that pestilent woman re­moved into the house and family of his bitterest enemy.Adding, that Masinissa possessed neither more pru­dence nor firmness than himself. His youth, indeed,had made him incautious; but there was evidently morefolly and rashness in the latter marriage than in his.'
14. These words, dictated not merely by animositytowards his enemy, but by anguish on seeing the womanwhom he had loved in the possession of his rival, im­pressed the mind of Scipio with no small degree ofsolicitude. He was however the more induced to listento Syphax, from the marriage having been hurried for­ward, in the midst of arms, without either consulting orwaiting for Laelius; and from Masinissa's haste, for onthe very day in which he had seen Sophonisba made pri­soner, he had contracted matrimony with her, and per­formed the nuptial sacrifice, in presence of the house­hold gods of his enemy. These proceedings appearedto Scipio the more heinous, because he himself, whenin Spain, and when a very young man, had not allowedhimself to be moved by the beauty of any captive what­ever. • While he was revolving these circumstances inhis mind Laelius and Masinissa arrived, to both ofwhom he gave the same kind reception ; and afterwardsmade known their conduct, with the highest praises, ina full assembly. Then retiring with Masinissa to a pri­vate place, he thus addressed him: 'I suppose, Masi­nissa, that in first coming to Spain for the purposeof contracting a friendship with me, and afterwards inAfrica, submitting yourself, and all your concerns, tomy protection, you must have been influenced by somegood qualities which I was said to possess. Now, ofthose virtues which made you think my favor worthsoliciting, there is not one on which I value myself somuch as temperance and the government of my pas­sions.

thrown into prison. When first produced by the tri­bunes, the people found no room for mercy, prepos­sessed as they were by the calamities of the Locren-sians. However, after having been repeatedly broughtforward, and the odium abating through length of time,the public resentment was softened; while the maimedcondition of Pleminius, and the respect they had forScipio, even in his absence, conciliated for them somedegree of favor. Nevertheless, Pleminius died in con­finement, and before his trial was finished. ClodiusLicinius, in the third book of his Roman history, re­lates, indeed, that this Pleminius, during the votivegames which Africanus, in his second consulate, ex­hibited at Rome, made an attempt, by means of somepersons whom he had bribed, to set fire to the city inseveral places, that he might have an opportunity ofbreaking the prison, and making his escape; and thaton the discovery of his wicked design, he was com­mitted to the dungeon by order of the senate. Con­cerning Scipio, there were no proceedings but in thesenate, where the encomiums made by all the deputiesand the tribunes on that general, his fleet, and army,induced them to vote that be should pass over intoAfrica as soon as possible; with liberty to make hisown choice from out the forces then in Sicily, whichto carry with him, and which to leave for the defenceof the province.
23. During these transactions at Rome, the Cartha­ginians, on their side, passed the winter in extremeanxiety. They fixed beacons on every promontory;kept scouts in incessant motion, every messenger fillingthem with terror. They had acquired, however, an ad­vantage of no small moment towards the defence ofAfrica,—an alliance with king Syphax; an assistance,on which they supposed the Romans to have relied,and as being their great inducement to set foot onAfrica. Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, was not only con­nected with the king in hospitality (as has been men­tioned above, when he and Scipio happened to come tohim at the same time from Spain), but mention had been

But with what force, with howgreat an army the war was to be carried on, was amatter that depended intirely on them. That therewere two Roman armies, one in Gaul, another in Etru-ria; and he was well assured that Spurius Lucretiuswould join his forces to those of Marcus Livius; where­fore they on their side must arm many thousands, toenable them to oppose two Roman generals and twoarmies.' The Gauls answered, that 'they had thestrongest inclination to act as he advised; but as theyhad one Roman army in the heart of their country, andanother in the next adjoining province of Etruria, al­most within their sight, if it should be publicly knownthat they gave aid to the Carthaginians, those twoarmies would immediately commence hostilities againstthem on both sides.' They requested him to ' demandsuch assistance only as the Gauls could supply insecret. The Ligurians,' they said, ' were at libertyto determine as they thought fit, the Roman campsbeing far distant from their lands and cities; besides,it was reasonable that they should arm their youth,and take their part in the war.' This the Liguriansdid not decline; they only required two months timeto make their levies. Mago, having sent home theGauls, hired soldiers privately in their country; pro­visions also of all kinds were sent to him secretly bytheir several states. Marcus Livius led his army ofvolunteer slaves from Etruria into Gaul, and havingjoined Lucretius, kept himself in readiness to opposeMago, if he should move from Liguria towards thecity; intending, if the Carthaginian should keep him­self quiet under that corner of the Alps, to continue inthe same district, near Ariminum, for the protection ofItaly.

Neither doubted, as soonas the noise of men and horseswas heard at a distance, that an enemy approached:therefore before they came within sight of each other,they got their arms in readiness, and the moment theymet, both hastened eagerly to engage. As they hap­pened to be nearly equal in number and valor, beingpicked men on both sides, they fought during severalhours with vigor, until fatigue, both of men and horses,put an end to the fight, without deciding the victory.Of the Macedonians, there fell forty horsemen; ofthe Romans thirty-five. Still, however, neither partywas able to carry back any certain information in whatquarter the camp of his enemy lay. But this was soonmade known to them by deserters; of whom, eitherthrough restlessness, or the prospect of reward, a suffi­cient number are found, in every war, to discover theaffairs of the contending parties.
34. Philip, judging that it would tend considerablytowards conciliating the affections of his men, and in­duce them to face danger more readily on his account,if he bestowed some pains on the burial of the horse­men, who fell in that expedition, ordered them to beconveyed into the camp, in order that all might bespectators of the honors paid them at their funeral.Nothing is so uncertain or so difficult to form a judgmentof, as the minds of the multitude. The very measureswhich seem calculated to increase their alacrity, in ex­ertions of every sort, often inspire them with fear andtimidity. Accordingly those, who, being always ac­customed to fight with Greeks and Illyrians, had onlyseen wounds made with javelins and arrows, seldomeven by lances, came to behold bodies dismemberedby the Spanish sword, some with their arms lopped off,or, the neck intirely cut through, heads severed fromthe trunk, and the bowels laid open, with other shock­ing circumstances which the present warfare hadwrought: they therefore perceived, with horror,against what weapons and what men they were tofight.

provinces of the consuls and pretors. Those of thepretors were the first settled, because that could bedone by the lots. The city jurisdiction fell to Ser-gius; the foreign to Minucius; Atilius obtained Sar­dinia; Manlius, Sicily; Sempronius, the Hither Spain,and Helvius, the Farther. When the consuls werepreparing to cast lots for Italy and Macedonia, LuciusOppius and Quintus Fulvius, plebeian tribunes, ob­jected to their proceeding, alleging that 'Macedoniawas a very distant province, and that the principalcause which had hitherto retarded the progress of thewar was that, when it was scarcely entered on, andjust at the commencement of operations, the formerconsul was always recalled. This was the fourth yearsince the declaration of war against Macedonia. Thegreater part of one year Sulpicius spent in seeking theking and his army; Villius, on the point of engagingthe enemy, was recalled. Quintius was detained atRome, for the greater part of his year, by businessrespecting religion; nevertheless, he had so conductedaffairs, that had he come earlier into the province, orhad the cold season been at a greater distance, hemight have put an end to hostilities. He was then justgoing into winter quarters; but, by all accounts, hehad brought the war into such a state, that if he werenot prevented by a successor, there was a reasonableprospect of being able to put an end to it in the courseof the ensuing summer.' By such arguments the tri­bunes so far prevailed, that the consuls declared thatthey would abide by the directions of the senate, if thecavillers would agree to do the same. Both partieshaving, accordingly, referred the determination in-tirely to those magistrates, a decree was passed, ap­pointing the two consuls to the government of the pro­vince of Italy. Titus Quintius was continued in com­mand, until a successor should be found.

these, and considering that the Romans were at thattime every where successful, the Carthaginians un­fortunate in Italy, and quite excluded from Spain,consented to embrace the friendship of the Romans,but refused to exchange the ratification of the treatyexcept with the Roman general in person. Lfeliusthen returned to Scipio, having obtained from the kingan engagement merely of safe conduct for him. Tohim, who aimed at conquests in Africa, the friendshipof Syphax was, in every respect, of the utmost im­portance: he was the most powerful prince in thatpart of the world, had already opposed even the Car­thaginians in war, while his dominions lay very con­veniently with respect to Spain, from which they areseparated by a narrow strait. Scipio thought the affairof such moment as to warrant the attempt, though at­tended with considerable danger, since otherwise itcould not be accomplished. Leaving therefore, for thesecurity of Spain, Lucius Marcius at Tarraco, andMarcus Silanus at New Carthage (to which place hehimself had made a hasty journey by land), and settingsail from Carthage with Cains Liclius, in two galleysof five banks, he passed over to Africa, while the seawas so calm that they generally used their oars,though sometimes they were assisted by a gentlebreeze. It happened that Hasdrubal, at the very sametime, after having been driven out of Spain, had en­tered the harbor with seven galleys of three banks,and having cast anchor, was mooring his ships. Onsight of these two five-banked ships, although no onedoubted that they belonged to the Romans, and mightbe overpowered by superior numbers before they en­tered the harbor, yet nothing ensued except tumultand confusion among the soldiers and sailors, endeavor­ing to no purpose to get their arms and ships in readi­ness; for the quinqueremes, having their sails filledby a brisk gale from the sea, were carried into theharbor before the Carthaginians could weigh theiranchors, and afterwards they dared not to raise a dis­turbance in the king's port.

Philip was filled with grief and vexation when hefound that, although he had, on all occasions, madethe most spirited and speedy exertions, yet fortunehad haffled his activity, by snatching away every ad­vantage when he had it within his view. In the as­sembly, however, concealing his chagrin, he spokewith great confidence, appealing to gods and men, that'at no time or place had he ever been remiss; thatwherever the sound of the enemy's arms was heard,thither he had instantly repaired; but that it couldhardly be determined whether, in the management ofthe war, his forwardness or the enemy's cowardice wasmore conspicuous; in such a dastardly manner hadAttains slipped out of his hands from Opus; Sulpiciusfrom Chalcis; and in the same way within these fewdays, Machanidas. That flight however did not al­ways succeed; and that a war should not be accounteddifficult, in which victory would be certain if the foecould be brought to a regular engagement. One ad­vantage, however, and that of the first magnitude, hehad already acquired—the confession of the enemythemselves that they were not a match for him; andin a short time,' he said, ' he should have to boast ofundoubted conquest; for whenever the enemy wouldmeet him in the field, they should find the issue nobetter than they seemed to expect.' This discourse ofthe king was received by the allies with great plea­sure. He then gave up to the Achaeans Heraea andTriphylia. Aliphera he restored to the Megalopoli-tans, they having produced sufficient evidence that itbelonged to their territories. Having received somevessels from the Achaeans, three galleys of four, andthree of two banks of oars, he sailed to Anticyra;from thence, with seven ships of five banks, and abovetwenty barks, which he had sent to the bay of Corinthto join the Carthaginian fleet, he proceeded to Erythrae,a town of the jEtolians near Eupalium, and theremade a descent.

Scipio received and heard himwith much satisfaction; he knew that Masinissa wasthe main support of the enemy with respect to cavalry,and the young man himself had given considerableproofs of spirit. After they had mutually pledgedtheir faith, he returned to Tarraco; and Masinissa hav­ing, with permission of the Romans, ravaged the neigh­boring soil, that he might not appear to have passedover to the continent for nothing, returned to Gades.

While Mago was preparing to pass into Africa,despairing of success in Spain (of which he had beenencouraged to entertain hopes, first, by the mutiny ofthe soldiers, and afterwards by the revolt of Indibilis),information was brought from Carthage that the senateordered him to carry over to Italy the fleet which hehad at Gades, and, having there hired as many of theGallic and Ligurian youths as he could find, to form ajunction with Hannibal, and not to suffer the war tosink into languor, after the very great exertions andgreater successes which had signalised its beginning.Money, to answer this purpose, was brought to Magofrom Carthage: in addition to which he extorted muchfrom the people of Gades, plundering not only theirtreasury but their temples, and compelling them tobring in their private properties of gold and silver tothe public stock.

They then began to in­quire for the first authors of it; but every one threwit off from himself, that he might appear rather to havebelieved rashly than to have been the contriver of thefiction. The leaders, now forsaken, began to dreadeven their own badges of office, and considered withterror the real and just authority which was about totake place of the empty show of command which theypossessed, and which would doubtless be exerted totheir destruction. While the mutiny was at a standthrough the amazement of the soldiers, on receivingundoubted intelligence, first, that Scipio was alive, andafterwards, that he was in good health, seven militarytribunes, despatched by himself, arrived in the camp.On their coming the mutineers were at first exaspe­rated, but they were soon softened by the mild andsoothing language in which these addressed such oftheir acquaintances as they met: for, at first goinground the tents, and then in the public tribunals, andin the pretorium, wherever they observed circles ofsoldiers engaged in conversation, they accosted themin such a manner as carried the appearance rather ofan inquiry into the cause of their resentment and sud­den disorder, than of throwing any blame on what hadpassed. The reasons generally alleged were, that ' theyhad not received their pay regularly; although, at thetime of the horrid transaction at Illiturgi, and after theutter destruction of the two generals and their twoarmies, it was by their bravery that the Roman namehad been supported and the province secured: thatthe people of Illiturgi had indeed met with the punish­ment due to their guilt, but their meritorious conducthad remained unrewarded.' The tribunes answered,that 'in these remonstrances their requests werefounded in justice, and should be laid before the gene­ral; that they were highly pleased to find that therewas nothing in their case more grievous or incurable;and that, by the favor of the gods, they had both Pub-lius Scipio and the state to reward their merit.'

any greater misfortune befallen us in Africa than hadat that time been experienced in Spain? Are therenow on that continent more numerous armies or bettergenerals than there were then in Spain? Was I fitterat that time of life for conducting a war than I amnow? Is a contest with a Carthaginian enemy lessdifficult in Spain than in Africa? It is an easy matter,after four Carthaginian armies routed and intirely dis­persed; after so many cities taken by force, or terri­fied into a surrender, while all places, even as far asthe ocean, have been brought under intire subjection;while so many princes, so many savage nations havebeen wholly reduced; in a word, after all Spain hasbeen reconquered, and in such a manner as that notrace of war remains ;—it is easy, I say, to depreciatethe value of my services ; just as easy, in truth, as itwill be, if I shall return victorious from Africa, tomake light of those very circumstances which are nowso greatly aggravated, and painted in such terriblecolors, for the purpose of detaining me here. It isaffirmed that no entrance can be found into Africa;that there are no harbors open to us; that Marcus Ati-lius was taken prisoner there, as if Marcus Atilins hadmiscarried on approaching that coast. But Fabiusdoes not recollect that this commander (afterwards,indeed, unfortunate) found the harbors of Africa open,and during the first year performed extraordinary ser­vices; and as far as concerned the Carthaginian gene­rals, remained unconquered to the last. The examplewhich you produce, therefore, does not in the leastdeter me. If that loss had even been sustained in thepresent war, and not in the former; if lately, andnot forty years ago, yet why should I not as wellpass into Africa after Regulus was made prisoner, asinto Spain, after the Scipios were slain; nor suffer itto be said that the birth of Xanthippus, a Lacedaemo­nian, was, by the defeat of our consul, more fortunateto Carthage, than mine to my own country? and whymight not I assume additional confidence from thatvery circumstance, that it was possible for the bravery

under Quintus Claudius, propretor; they consisted eachof two legions. It was decreed that Marcus Livius,proconsul, whose command had heen prolonged for ayear, should receive two legions of volunteer slavesfrom Caius Terentius, propretor in Etruria; and thatQuintus Mamilius should transfer his judicial employ­ment to his colleague, and take the command in Gaulwith the army which had belonged to Lucius Porcius,propretor; orders at the same time being given him tolay waste the lands of the Gauls, who had revolted onthe approach of Hasdrubal. The protection of Sicilywas given in charge to Caius Servilius, with the twolegions of Cannae, as Caius Mamilius had held it.From Sardinia, the old army which had served underAulus Hostilius, was brought home; and the consulslevied a new legion, which Tiberius Claudius was tocarry with him. Quintus Claudius and Caius Hos­tilius Tubulus were continued in command for a year,that the former might hold Tarentum as his province,the latter Capua. Marcus Valerius, proconsul, whohad been intrusted with the defence of the sea-coastsround Sicily, was ordered to deliver thirty ships toCaius Servilius, and to return home with all the restof the fleet.
11. While the public was under much anxiety, onaccount of the great danger and importance of the war,and ever apt to refer to the gods the causes of all theirsuccesses and disappointments, accounts were propa­gated of a number of prodigies: that at Tarracina, thetemple of Jupiter; at Satricum, that of Mother Ma-tuta, had been struck by lightning; the people beingalso greatly terrified by two snakes creeping into theformer unperceived through the very door. From An-tium it was reported that ears of corn had appearedbloody to the reapers. At Caere a pig had been litteredwith two heads, and a lamb yeaned which was of bothsexes. It was said also, that two suns had been seenat Alba, and that light had burst forth on a suddenduring the night-time at Fregellae.

the lower sea, to Genoa, opened the campaign with aninvasion of Lignria. Two towns, Clastidium and Li-tubium, both belonging to the Ligurians, and twostates of the same nation, Celela and Cerdicium, sur­rendered to him. And now, all the states on this sideof the Po, except the Boians among the Gauls, andthe Ilvatians among the Ligurians, were reduced tosubmission: no less, it is said, than fifteen townsand twenty thousand men. He then led his legionsinto the territory of the Boians.
30. The Boian army had, not very long before,crossed the Po, and joined the Insubrians and Caeno-manians; for, having heard that the consuls intendedto act with their forces united, they wished to increasetheir own strength by this junction. But when infor­mation reached them that one of the consuls was ra­vaging the country of the Boians, a dispute instantlyarose. The Boians demanded that all, in conjunction,should carry succor to those who were attacked;while the Insubrians positively refused to leave theircountry defenceless. In consequence of this dissen­sion, the armies separated; the Boians went to defendtheir own territory, and the Insubrians, with the Cae-nomanians, encamped on the banks of the river Min-cius. About five miles below this spot the consulCornelius pitched his camp close to the same river.Sending emissaries hence into the villages of the Cae-nomanians, and Brixia, the capital of their tribe, helearned with certainty that their young men had takenarms without the approbation of the elders; and thatthe Caenomanians had not joined in the revolt of theInsubrians, by any authority from the state. Onwhich he invited to him the principal of the natives,and endeavored to contrive and concert with them themeans of inducing the younger Caenomanians to for­sake the party of the Insubrians; and either to marchaway and return home, or to come over to the sideof the Romans. This he was not able to effect; butso far, he received solemn assurances that, in caseof a battle, they would either stand inactive, or,

Hannibal, after ex­erting this last effort of bravery, having fled to Ha-drumetum, on receiving a summons, returned to Car­thage in the thirty-sixth year after he had left it, andwhen a boy. He acknowleged, in the senate-house,that he was vanquished not only in the recent battle,but in the whole of the war; and that there was noother hope of avoiding ruin, but in obtaining peace.
36. Immediately after the battle, Scipio havingtaken and plundered the enemy's camp, returned withimmense booty to the sea-coast to his fleet, havingreceived an account that Publius Lentulus was arrivedat Utica with fifty ships of war, a hundred transports,and store of all kinds. With a view therefore of in­creasing the consternation at Carthage, by showingthem objects of terror on every side, after despatchingLaelius to Rome with news of the victory, he orderedCneius Octavius to conduct the legions to that city byland; and, joining the fleet of Lentulus, lately arrived,with his own which he had before, he himself, settingsail from Utica, steered for the harbor of Carthage.When he had arrived within a small distance, he wasmet by a Carthaginian ship, dressed with fillets andbranches of olive, on board of which were ten ambas­sadors, the chief men of the state, sent by the advice

the signal was sounded a second time. Though hereceived account of all these particulars, yet the cir­cumstance of the camp's not being enlarged led to afalse conclusion: they were two, as before the arrivalof the second consul; one belonging to Marcus Livius,the other to Lucius Porcius; and no addition had beenmade to the trenches of either, to make more room fortents within. One thing particularly struck that vete­ran commander, long accustomed to act against Romanarmies, which was, that according to the informationof his scouts, the signal was sounded once in the pre-tor's camp, and twice in the consuls'. Hence he con­cluded that the two consuls must be there; but how toaccount for Nero's having left Hannibal behind per­plexed him extremely. Of all things, he could theleast suspect what had really happened, that Hannibalcould be so blinded, and in a business of such magni­tude, as not to know where the general was, and wherethe army whose'camp stood facing his own. He sup­posed that some disaster of no ordinary kind musthave hindered him from following; and he began tofear greatly that he himself had come too late withsuccor, that his affairs were too desperate to be re­trieved, and that the same fortune which the Romanshad met in Spain awaited them now in Italy. Heeven conjectured that his letter had not reached hisbrother; and that, in consequence of its being inter­cepted, the consul had hastened thither to overpowerhim. Distracted by these doubts and fears, he extin­guished all his fires; and, at the first watch, orderedhis troops to strike their tents in silence, and to march.In the hurry and confusion of a movement by nightthe guides were not watched with the necessary careand attention; one of them, therefore, stopped in aplace of concealment, which he had before fixed on inhis mind, and the other swam across the river Me-taurus, at a pass with which he was acquainted.

We now see their city de­stroyed,—the city of a people for whose gratificationHannibal ruined Saguntum. We now receive tributefrom their country—a circumstance not more gratify­ing to us, in the profit we derive from it, than in thesatisfying of our revenge. In gratitude for these bless­ings, greater than which we could not either hope orimplore from the immortal gods, the senate and peopleof Saguntum have sent us their ten ambassadors topresent their thanks; and, at the same time, to con­gratulate you on the success which has of late yearsattended your arms in Spain and Italy. You hold thepossession of Spain, so acquired, not only as far as thecity of Iberus, but to the utmost limits and boundariesby the ocean; while in Italy you have left nothing tothe Carthaginian but what the rampart of his campincloses. To Jove, supremely great and good, whopresides over the fortress of the capitol, we have beenordered, not only to make acknowlegements for theseblessings, but, with your permission, to bear thitherthis offering, a golden crown, in token of victory. Werequest that you will permit us this act of reverence;and also that you will ratify by your authority, and fixon a permanent footing, the advantages bestowed on usby your commanders.' The senate answered the Sa-guntine ambassadors, that ' the destruction and resto­ration of Saguntum would be an example to all na­tions of social faith fulfilled on both sides; that theircommanders, in restoring that city, and delivering itsinhabitants from slavery, had acted properly, regu­larly, and agreeably to the intentions of the senate:that all other acts of kindness shown them had like­wise their approbation; and that they gave them per-

Marcellus was even spokenof with displeasure, because, besides the failure in hisfirst battle, he had in the middle of summer, whileHannibal was carrying his excursions through variousparts of Italy, drawn off his army to Venusia, to lodgethem in houses. He had a bitter enemy in Caius Pub-lius Bibulus, a plebeian tribune: this man, ever sincethe battle which proved unfortunate, had, in frequentharangues, represented Claudius in a dishonorablelight, endeavoring to render him odious to the com­mons; and he now proposed to deprive him of thecommand. The friends of Claudius nevertheless pro­cured an order that Marcellus, leaving at Venusia alieutenant-general, should come home to Rome, toclear himself of those charges, on which his enemiesfouuded the resolutions which they proposed; andthat, during his absence, no step should be taken to­wards divesting him of the command. It so happenedthat Marcellus came to Rome to rescue his characterfrom disgrace, and the consul Quintus Fulvius to holdthe elections at the same time.
21. The business respecting Marcellus' commissionwas debated in the Flaminian circus, amidst a vastconcourse of plebeians, and people of all ranks. Thetribune of the commons brought forward heavy charges,not only against Marcellus, but against the whole bodyof the nobles. * To their treacherous and dilatory con­duct,' he said, ' it was owing, that Hannibal now heldpossession of Italy, as his province, for the tenth year,and passed more of his life there than in Carthage.The Roman people now enjoyed the fruits of continuingMarcellus in command: his army, after being twicerouted, was spending the summer at Venusia, anddwelling in houses instead of the camp.'

charge; but soon after greater numbers pouring out,and their whole force of cavalry joining in the conflict,they could no longer be resisted. Yet Masinissa didnot betake himself to a hasty flight, but retired lei­surely, until he drew them on to the hills which con­cealed the Roman cavalry. These immediately risingup, their strength unimpaired, and their horses fresh,spread themselves round Hanno and the Africans, whowere fatigued in the pursuit; and Masinissa, suddenlywheeling about, returned to the charge. About onethousand, who composed the first division, and whocould not easily retreat, were, together with Hannothe commander, surrounded and slain; the rest, terri­fied principally by the death of their general, fled inconfusion, and were pursued for thirty miles by theconquerors, who took or slew two thousand more ofthe cavalry. It appeared that there were among the9enot less than two hundred Carthaginian horsemen,several of them of the richest and most distinguishedfamilies.
35. It happened that the same day on which thisbattle was fought the ships which had carried thebooty to Sicily, returned with stores, as if they hadforeseen that they were to bear away another cargo asbefore. All writers do not mention two generals ofthe Carthaginians of the same name being slain in twobattles of the cavalry; apprehending, I suppose, thatthere was a mistake, occasioned by the same fact beingrelated twice. Nay, Coelius and Valerius even assertthat Hanno was taken prisoner. Scipio made presentsto the officers and horsemen, according to the behaviorof each; and, above all, he paid extraordinary honorsto Masinissa. Having placed a strong garrison inSalera, he set out with the rest of the army; and notonly laid waste the country wherever he marched, butalso took some cities and towns, and thereby widelydiffused the terror of his arms.

The business was not long delayed;and as the huts all stood contiguously, the flamesspread rapidly through every part of the camp. Thealarm was great, by reason of its being night, andfrom the widely-extended blaze; but the king's troops,thinking it an accidental calamity, rushed out unarmed,in order to extinguish the flames, and met the enemyin arms, particularly the Numidians, whom Masiuissa,being well acquainted with the king's station, hadposted at the openings of the passes. Many perishedin their beds while half asleep; while many, in theirprecipitate flight, crowding on one another, were trod­den to death in the narrow passages of the gates.
0. When the Carthaginian sentinels, awakened bythe tumult of the night, beheld the fire, they also sup­posed it to be accidental; while the shout, raised amidstthe slaughter and wounds, was so confused, (the alarm,too, being in the dark,) that they were unable to dis­cover the cause or extent of the evil which assailedthem. Running out therefore in the utmost hurry, byall the gates, without arms, as not suspecting an enemyto be near, and carrying nothing with them but whatmight serve to extinguish the flames, they rushedagainst the body of Romans. All of these were slain,not merely to gratify hostile animosity, but in order toprevent any one escaping with intelligence as to thetruth of the affair. Scipio, immediately after, attackedthe gates, which were neglected, as may be supposed,during such confusion, and set fire to the nearest huts;which soon communicating to the others, the wholewas enveloped in one general conflagration. Half-burned men and cattle stopped up the passages, firstby the hurry of their flight, and afterwards with theircarcases. Those who had escaped the flames were cutoff by the sword, and the two camps were, by one fatalblow, involved in utter ruin.

to his own and his father's friends, about five hundredNumidians assembled about him. He then sent backthe Moors according to his engagement; and althoughthe numbers that joined him were short of his expecta­tions, and not such as might encourage him to under­take an affair of moment; yet, believing that by enter­ing on action, and making some effort, he should gatherstrength for a more important enterprise, he threwhimself in the way of the young king Lacumaces, as hewas going to Syphax at Thapsus. The attendants ofLacumaces flying back in consternation, Masinissa tookthe city at the first assault, received the submission ofsome of the king's party who surrendered, and slewothers who attempted to resist; but the greatest partof them, with the boy himself, escaped during thetumult to Thapsus, whither they had at first intendedto go. The success of Masinissa in this small exploit,and on the first commencement of his operations, drewthe regards of the Numidians towards him, while theold soldiers of Gala flocked from all parts of the coun­try and the towns, inviting the young prince to proceedto the recovery of his father's kingdom. Mezetuluswas superior in number of men; for, besides the armywith which he had conquered Capusa, he was strength­ened by some troops who had submitted, after the kingwas slain ; the boy Lacumaces having likewise broughtsuccors from Syphax. Mezetulus had fifteen thousandfoot, ten thousand horse, with whom Masinissa engagedin battle, though much inferior in number. The valor,however, of the veteran soldiers prevailed, aided by theskill of their leader, who had gained experience in thewar between the Romans and Carthaginians. Theyoung king, with his guardian and a small body ofMassylians, escaped into the territories of the Cartha­ginians. Masinissa thus recovered his father's throne;yet, foreseeing that he should have a much moresevere struggle to maintain against Syphax, he thoughtit best to come to a reconciliation with his cousin-ger-man.

therefore introduced a proposal of recalling the volun­teer slaves to the standards. The senate gave the con­suls unlimited power to fill up their companies withany men whom they approved; to choose out of allthe armies such as they liked, and to exchange them,and remove them from one province to another, as theyshould judge best for the public service. In the ma­nagement of all these matters, the greatest harmonyprevailed between the consuls; and the volunteerslaves were inrolled in the nineteenth and twentiethlegions. Some writers say that on this occasion power­ful reinforcements were also sent from Spain by Pub-lius Scipio to Marcus Livius; eight thousand Spaniardsand Gauls, two thousand legionary soldiers, and a bodyof cavalry composed of Numidians and Spaniards, innumber one thousand eight hundred; that Marcus Lu­cretius brought these forces by sea, and that Caius Ma-milius sent from Sicily four thousand archers andslingers.
39. The disquietude at Rome was increased by aletter brought out of Gaul from the pretor Lucius Por-cius; the contents of which were, that ' Hasdrubal hadmoved out of winter quarters, and was now on his pas­sage over the Alps: that eight thousand of the Ligu-rians were embodied and armed, and would join himas soon as he arrived in Italy, unless an army weresent into Liguria to attack them beforehand: as tohimself, he would advance as far as he should think itsafe with his small force.' This letter obliged the con­suls to finish the levies with haste, and to set out fortheir respective provinces earlier than they had in­tended; for their purpose was, that each should keephis antagonist employed in his own province, so as notto suffer the two to combine their forces into one body.An opinion, formed by Hannibal, helped to farther theirdesign: for though he believed that his brother wouldmake good his way into Italy during the course of thatsummer, yet, when he reflected on the difficulties withwhich he had himself struggled, first in the passage ofthe Rhone, then in that of the Alps, fighting against

The consul Sulpicius, inquiring of theheralds whether they would direct the declaration ofthe war against king Philip to be made to himself inperson, or whether it would be sufficient to publish itin the nearest garrison within the frontiers of his king­dom, they answered that either would do. The consulreceived authority from the seuate to send any personwhom he thought proper, not being a senator, as am­bassador, to denounce war against the king. Theythen proceeded to arrange the armies for the consulsand pretors. The consuls were ordered to levy twolegions, and to disband the veteran troops. Sulpicius,to whom the management of this new and highly im­portant war had been decreed, was allowed permissionto carry with him as many volunteers as he could pro­cure out of the army which Publius Scipio had broughthome from Africa; but he was not empowered to com­pel any veteran soldier to attend him. They orderedthat the consul should give to the pretors, Lucius Fu-rius Purpureo and Quintus Minucius Rufus, five thou­sand of the allies of the Latine confederacy; with whichforces they should hold, one, the province of Gaul, theother, Bruttium. Quintus Fulvius Gillo was ordered,in like manner, to select out of the army which Pub­lius tEHus, late consul, had commanded, such as hadbeen the shortest time in the service, until he alsomade up five thousand of the allies and Latine confe­derates, for guarding his province of Sicily. To Mar­cus Valerius Falto, who, during the former year, hadheld the province of Campania, as pretor, the commandwas continued for a year; in order that he might goover in quality of propretor to Sardinia, and chooseout of the army there five thousand of the allies of theLatine confederacy, who also had been the shortesttime in the service.

6. The consul Marcus Valerius, on receipt of theletters by which he was summoned home, gave up thecommand of the province and the army to the pretorCincius; sent Marcus Valerius Messala, commanderof the fleet, with half of the ships to Africa, to plunderthe country, and at the same time to gain intelligenceof the motions and intentions of the Carthaginians:then he set out himself with ten ships, and arriving atRome after a prosperous voyage, immediately con­vened the senate. Here he recited the services whichhe had performed; that 'after hostilities had beencarried on in Sicily, and many severe losses sustainedon land and sea during almost sixty years, he hadbrought the war to a final termination. That therewas not one Carthaginian in Sicily, nor one Sicilian,of those who had been compelled by fear to fly andlive abroad, who was not then at home; that all hadbeen reinstated in the possession of their own citiesand estates, and were employed in ploughing and sow­ing; that the land, after having been long deserted,was at length filled again with inhabitants, and in acondition both to afford plenty to its occupiers, and themost certain supplies of provisions to the Roman peo­ple either in peace or war.'

This answer the ambassadors car­ried back to the assembly; and there Mandonius andthe other chiefs were seized and delivered up to pu­nishment. Terms of peace were then settled with thestates of Spain, who were ordered to pay double taxesfor that year, and to supply corn for six months, toge­ther with cloaks and vests for the army, hostages beingreceived from about thirty states. This tumultuaryrebellion in Spain having been thus suppressed, with­out any great difficulty, within the space of a few daysafter its commencement, every warlike operation wasdirected against Africa.

Caius Lajlius, having arrived in the night atHippo Royal, led out his soldiers and marines inregular bodies, at the first light, in order to ravage thecountry; and, as the inhabitants had taken no pre­cautions more than if it had been a time of peace,great damage was done, and affrighted messengersfilled Carthage with the most violent alarms; affirmingthat the Roman fleet had arrived, and that it was com­manded by Scipio, of whose passing into Sicily theyhad already heard. Nor could they tell, with any de­gree of exactness, while their fears aggravated everycircumstance, how many ships they had seen, or whatnumber of men they had landed. At first, therefore,consternation and terror, afterwards melancholy de­jection, seized the people's minds, reflecting on the re­verse of fortune which had taken place, and lamentingthat 'they who lately, flushed with success, had theirforces lying at the gates of Rome, and after cutting offso many armies of the enemy, had made almost everystate in Italy submit to them, either through fear orchoice, were now, from the current of success havingturned against them, to behold the devastation of

routed and dispersed the Massylians. Masinissa fledfrom the field, attended only by a few horsemen, to amountain which the natives call Balbus. A number offamilies with their tents and cattle, which is all theirwealth, followed their king; the rest of the Massy­lians submitted to Syphax. The mountain of whichthe fugitive took possession abounds with grass andwater; and as it was thus well adapted to the grazing ofcattle, it supplied abundance of food to feed men livingon flesh and milk. Excursions from henee were madethrough all the neighboring parts; at first secretly andby night; afterwards openly. The lands of the Car­thaginians suffered most, because there was greaterplenty of spoil there than among the Numidians, andit was carried off with less danger. At length they be­came so bold as to carry down their booty to the sea,and sell it to merchants, who brought their ships thi­ther for the purpose; and on these occasions greaternumbers of the Carthaginians were slain and madeprisoners than often happens in a regular engagement.On this subject the Carthaginians made heavy com­plaints to Syphax, earnestly pressing him to crush thisremnant of the foe. To this he was himself well in­clined, but thought it rather beneath the dignity of aking to pursue a vagrant robber, as he styled him,through the mountains.
32. Bocchar, a spirited and enterprising general,was chosen by the Numidian for that employment.Four thousand foot and two thousand horse were givenhim; with a promise of immense reward if he shouldbring back the head of Masinissa; or rather if beshould take him alive, for that the latter would be tohim a matter of inexpressible joy. Falling unex­pectedly on Masinissa's men, when they were scat­tered about and off their guard, and who were in con­siderable numbers, he shut them out, together withtheir cattle, from the protection of those who were inarms, driving Masinissa himself, with his few fol­lowers, to the summit of the mountain. On this, con­sidering the war as nearly finished, he sent to the king

Inthe same year died Quintus Fabius Maximus, in ex­treme old age, if it be true, as some writers affirm, thathe had been augur for sixty-two years. He was cer­tainly a man worthy of the great surname which hebore, even if he were the first to whom it was applied.He surpassed his father, and was equal to his grand­father, in the honorable posts which he filled. Hisgrandfather, Rullus, was distinguished by a greaternumber of victories, and greater battles; but the ac­tions of Fabius, having such an antagonist as Hannibal,may be considered as equivalent to them all. He wasdeemed to possess more caution than spirit: but thoughit may be doubted whether the dilatoriness of his con­duct arose from his natural disposition, or from a con­viction that it was best suited to the war in which hewas engaged, yet nothing is more certain than that thisman alone, as the poet Ennius says, by his delays re­trieved our affairs. Quintus Fabius Maximus, his son,was consecrated augur in bis place, and Servius Sulpi-cius Galba pontiff, in his place also; for he held twooffices in the college of priests. The Roman gameswere repeated for one day; the plebeian thrice re­peated intire, by the curule ediles, Marcus SextiusSabinus and Caius Treniellius Flaccus. Both thesewere elected pretors, and, with them, Cains LiviusSalinator and Caius Aurelius Cotta. The different ac­counts given by writers render it uncertain whetherCaius Servilius, consul, presided at the elections thatyear, or Publius Sulpicius, nominated dictator by him,because he himself was detained in Etruria, being em­ployed, pursuant to a decree of the senate, in holdinginquisitions relative to the conspiracies of the principalinhabitants.

chief pontiff. We are told that this election was at­tended by a greater concourse of people than anyduring that war. They had come together from allparts, not only for the purpose of giving their votes,but of getting a sight of Scipio; and ran in crowds,both to his house and to the capitol, while he was per­forming sacrifice, by offering to Jupiter a hundredoxen, which he had vowed on occasion of the mutinyof the soldiers in Spain. Strong expectations were atthe same time entertained, that as Cains Lutatius hadfinished the former Punic war, so Publius CorneliusScipio would finish the present; and that, as he hadalready expelled the Carthaginians from every part ofSpain, he would in like manner expel them from Italy.They therefore destined Africa to him as a province,as if the war in Italy were at an end. The election ofthe pretors was then held: two were appointed, whowere at the time plebeian ediles, Spurius Lucretiusand Cneius Octavius; and, of private rank, CneiusServilius Caepio and Lucius jEmilius Papus. In thefourteenth year of the Punic war, as soon as PubliusCornelius Scipio and Publius Licinius Crassus enteredon the consulship, the provinces for the consuls werenamed; for Scipio, Sicily, without drawing lots, withthe consent of his colleague, because the necessaryattendance on religious matters required the presenceof the chief pontiff in Italy; for Crassus, Bruttium.The provinces of the pretors were then disposed of bylot; that of the city fell to Cneius Servilius; Arimi-num (so they called Gaul) to Spurius Lucretius; Si­cily to Lucius iEmilius; and Sardinia to Cneius Octa­vius. The senate was held in the capitol; there, onthe matter being proposed by Publius Scipio, a decreewas made, that the games which he had vowed duringthe mutiny of the soldiers in Spain should be exhibited,and the expense defrayed out of the money which him­self had conveyed to the treasury.

If they had discoveredproofs of his guilt, after seeing such reason to repentof having trusted him with the consulship once, whyintrust him with it a second time V While he utteredthese, and such like reproaches and complaints, hewas checked by the senators, who bade him recollectthat 'Camillus, though exiled by his country, yet re­turned at its call, and re-established it, when shakenfrom the very foundations; that it was the duty of aman to mollify by patience, and to bear with resigna­tion, the severity of his country, like that of a parent.'By the united exertions of all, Marcus Livius waselected consul with Caius Claudius Nero.
35. Three days after the election of pretors washeld, and there were chosen into that office LuciusPorcius Licinus, Caius Mamilius Aulus, and CaiusHostilius Cato. As soon as the elections were con­cluded, and the games celebrated, the dictator andmaster of the horse resigned their offices. Caius Te-rentius Varro was sent, as propretor, into Etruria, inorder that Caius Hostilius might go from that provinceof Tarentum to take the command of the army whichhad acted under the late consul, Titus Quintius; andthat Titus Manlius might go beyond sea, in thecharacter of ambassador, to observe what businesswas going on abroad; and also, as during that sum­mer the Olympic games were to be exhibited, whichwere also attended by the greatest concourse of thepeople of Greece, that he might go to that assembly,if not prevented by the enemy, and inform any Sici­lians whom he should find driven there, and any citi­zens of Tarentum, banished by Hannibal, that theymight return to their homes, and might be assuredthat the Roman people meant to restore to them thewhole of the property which they possessed before thewar began.

2. A formidable war was raised this summer in Spainby the instigation of Indibilis the Illergetian, on noother grounds than the contempt which, through hisgreat admiration of Scipio, he entertained of all othergenerals. He was of opinion that 'this commanderwas the only one whom the Romans had remaining,the others of any note having, as he conceived, beenslain by Hannibal: for when the Scipios were cut offin Spain they had none whom they could send thither;and afterwards, when the war pressed too heavily onthem in Italy, the present one had been recalled to actagainst Hannibal. That, besides the Romans havingonly nominal generals in Spain, their veteran armybad been withdrawn from thence: that, among thetroops which remained, there was neither spirit norfirmness, as they consisted of an undisciplined multi­tude of new recruits: that there would never again besuch an opportunity of asserting the liberty of Spain:that until that day they had been slaves either to theCarthaginians or Romans; and that, not to one or theother by turns, but sometimes to both together: thatthe Carthaginians had been expelled by the Romans,and that the Romans might now be expelled by theSpaniards, if these would act with unanimity; so that,being for ever freed from the dominion of foreigners,they might return to their own native manners andrites.' By these, and other the like discourses, heroused to arms, not only his own countrymen, but theAusetanians also, a neighboring state, with other na­tions that bordered on his and their country; so thatwithin a few days thirty thousand foot and about fourthousand horse assembled in the territory of Sedeta,according to his directions. On the other side, theRoman generals, Lucius Lentulus and Lucius ManliuiAcidinus, lest the war, being neglected in the begin­ning, should spread with increasing violence, unitedtheir armies; and conducting them through the coun­try of the Ausetanians in as peaceable a manner as if

The followinganswer was ordered to be given to the ambassadors:that 'the senate retained a due sense of Attalus' friend­ship, in aiding the Roman commanders with his fleetand other forces. That they would neither send suc­cors to Attalus against Antiochus, the ally and friendof the Roman people, nor would they detain the troopswhich he had sent to their assistance, to his inconve­nience. That it was ever a constant rule with theRoman people to use the aid of others, so far only aswas agreeable to the will of those who gave it; andeven to leave those who were so inclined at full libertyto determine when that assistance should commence,and when it should cease. That they would send am­bassadors to Antiochus, to represent to him that Atta­lus, with his fleet and army, were at the present em­ployed by the Roman people against Philip, theircommon enemy; and that they would request Antio­chus to leave the dominions of Attalus unmolested,and to refrain from all hostilities; for that it was muchto be wished that kings, who were allies and friendsto the Roman people, should maintain friendship be­tween themselves also.'
9. When the consul Titus Quintius had finished thelevies, in making which he chose principally such ashad served in Spain or Africa, that is, soldiers of ap­proved courage, and when hastening to set forward tohis province, he was delayed by reports of prodigies,and the expiations of them necessary to be performed.There bad been struck by lightning the public road atVeii, a temple of Jupiter at Lanuvium, a temple ofHercules at Ardea, with a wall and towers at Capua;also the edifice which is called Alba.

which would probably be against whatever part wasdestitute of forces for its defence: for that fleet, inpursuance of a decree of the senate, the consuls en­listed three thousand men, and also two city legions,for the exigences of the war. Spain, with the armiesthere, and the command, was decreed to the formergenerals, Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidi-hus. The Romans employed in their service, for thatyear, in all, twenty legions, and a hundred and sixtyships of war. The pretors were directed to repair totheir provinces; and orders were given to the consulsthat, before their departure from the city, they shouldcelebrate the great games, which Titus Manlius Tor-quatus, in his dictatorship, had vowed to be exhibitedin the fifth year, if the condition of the state remainedunaltered. Religious apprehensions were raised inmen's minds by relations of prodigies brought fromseveral places. It was believed that crows had notonly torn with their beaks some gold in the capitol,but had even eaten it. At Antium, mice gnawed agolden crown. A vast quantity of locusts filled allthe country round Capua, though it could not be dis­covered from whence they came. At Reate a foal wasproduced with five feet. At Anagnia there appearedin the sky, at first scattered fire, and afterwards a pro­digious blaze. At Frusino a circle encompassed thesun with a narrow line; then the orb of the sun, in­creasing in size, extended its circumference beyondthe circle. At Arpinum, in a level plain, the earthsunk into a vast gulf. When one of the consuls sa­crificed the first victims, the head of the liver waswanting. These prodigies were expiated by thegreater victims, the college of pontiffs directing towhat gods the sacrifices should be made.

As soon as this business was finished, the consulsand pretors set out for their respective provinces.They directed their chief attention to Africa, as if itwere allotted to them, either because they saw thatthe grand interests of their country, and of the war,depended on the proceedings there, or from a desire

and again, if it were, in my judgment it is the consulwho acts amiss; for it is a mockery of the senate topretend to consult them on a question if already de­cided, and not the senator, who in his place wouldspeak to the business which he supposed in hand.Now I am well aware, that, by disapproving this vio­lent haste to pass over into Africa, I expose myself totwo impulations: one the caution natural to my tem­per, which young men have my free consent to callcowardice and sloth; while I have no reason to besorry that, although the schemes of others always car­ried at first view a more specious appearance, yet minewere on experience found to be more useful. Theother imputation to which I shall be liable is that ofdetraction and envy towards the rising glory of thevaliant consul:—from a suspicion of which kind, ifneither my past life and morals can free me, nor adictatorship and five consulships, together with such astore of glory acquired in the transactions both of warand peace, that it is more likely I should be satiatedthan desirous of more; let my age, at least, acquit me.For what emulation can I have with him, who is notequal in age even to my son? When I was dictator,when I was in full vigor, and proceeding in a courseof the greatest achievements, no one heard me, eitherin the senate or before the people, make opposition tothe proposed measure, (although such as had neverbefore been heard of, even in conversation,) of con­ferring power equal to mine on the master of the horse,and who at the very time was endeavoring to injuremy character. I chose to effect my purpose by actionsrather than words; and that he who was set on a levelwith me in the judgment of others should at length,by his own confession, allow me a superiority overhim.

entertain a much greater animosity against them thanagainst the Carthaginians; for, with the latter, thecontest was for empire and glory, almost without re­sentment, but the former they were called on to punishboth for perfidy and cruelty. That the time was nowcome when they were to take vengeance for the hor­rid murder of their fellow-soldiers, and for the trea­chery ready to be executed on themselves also, hadthey happened to fly to the same place; and, by a se­vere example, to establish it as a maxim to all futureages, that no Roman citizen or soldier, in any state offortune, should be injured with impunity.' Their ragebeing excited by this harangue, they distributed thescaling ladders to chosen men in each company; andthe army being divided into two parts, one of whichLaelius, lieutenant-general, was to command, they as­saulted the city in two places at once, striking terrorinto the assailed by the twofold danger to which theywere exposed. It was not one leader, or a number ofchiefs, but their own violent apprehensions, in conse­quence of their guilt, that induced the inhabitants tomake a vigorous defence; they were fully sensible,and they reminded each other, that ' their punishment,not a victory, was the object aimed at: that the mat­ter for present consideration was, where they shouldchoose to meet death, whether in the field and in fight,where the chance of war, equal to both parties, oftenraises the vanquished, and pulls down the conqueror;or whether after seeing their city burned and demo­lished, and after suffering every indignity and dis­grace, they should expire among chains and stripes,in the presence of their captive wives and children.'Therefore, not only those who were of an age to beararms, or the men alone, but women and boys addedexertions beyond the strength of their minds or bodies,supplying with weapons those who were engaged inthe fight, and carrying stones to the walls for otherswho were strengthening the works; for beside thattheir liberty was at stake, and by which the brave arepowerfully excited, the1 extreme severity of punish-

Even now, and after so many ages, theirnames should not be lost in silence, nor should they bedefrauded of their due praise: they were these—Signia,Norba, Saticulum, Brundusium, Fregellae, Luceria,Venusia, Atlria, Firma, Ariminum; on the coast of theother sea, Pontia, Paestum, and Cosa; and in the in­land parts, Beneventum, jEsernia, Spoletum, Placen-tia, and Cremona. Supported by these, the Romanempire was enabled to stand; and they received everymark of gratitude both in the senate, and in the as­sembly of the people. The former ordered that nomention should be made of the other twelve depend­encies, which had refused to furnish their quota forthe war, and that the consuls should neither dismissnor detain their ambassadors, nor hold any communi­cation with them: such a tacit proof of displeasure wasjudged the most suitable to the dignity of the Romanpeople. While the consuls were busy in expeditingthe other necessary preparations for the campaign, itwas resolved to draw out of the treasury the vicesimarygold (that is to say, a fund formed of the twentiethpart of the value of slaves enfranchised), which was re­served for exigences of the utmost necessity. Therewas drawn out accordingly, to the amount of fourthousand pounds weight of gold. Of this were givento the consuls, to Marcus Marcellus and Publius Sul-picius, proconsuls, and to Lucius Veturius, the pretor,to whom the lots had given the province of Gaul, fivehundred pounds each; and besides this there weregiven, in particular charge, to the consul Fabius, onehundred pounds of gold to be carried into the citadelof Tarentum.

To Caius Arunculeiuswere assigned, for Sardinia, the same legions whichhad served in that province under Publius ManliusVulso. Publius Sulpicius was continued in commandfor a year, to hold the province of Macedonia, and withthe same legion and the same fleet which he then had.Thirty quinqueremes were ordered to be sent fromSicily to Tarentum, to Quintus Fabius the consul;and, with the rest of the fleet, Marcus Valerius Laevi-nus was either to sail over to Africa himself, to ravagethe country, or to send thither Lucius Cincius, or Mar­cus Valerius Messala.

There had been hopes ofgaining possession of Gades without a contest, bymeans of a conspiracy of the inhabitants, some ofwhom came of their own accord to the Roman campwith promises to that effect, as has been mentionedbefore; but the plot was discovered before it was ripe;and Mago having seized all the conspirators, gavethem in charge to Adherbal the pretor, to be con­ducted to Carthage. Adherbal put them on board aship of five banks, and sending it off before him, be­cause it sailed slower than any one of three banks,followed himself at a small distance with eight three-banked vessels. The quinquereme was justenteringthestrait, when Laelius, who had sailed in a quinqueremealso from the harbor of Carteja, attended by seventriremes, bore down on Adherbal and the triremes;taking for granted that the quinquereme, once caughtin the rapid current of the narrow pass, would not beable to tack about. The Carthaginian, alarmed bythis unexpected affair, hesitated for some time whetherhe should follow the quinquereme, or face the enemy.This delay put it out of his power to avoid an engage­ment, for they were already within a weapon's cast,and the Roman pressing him closely on all sides. Theforce of the stream, too, had rendered it impossible tomanage their ships; nor was the fight like a naval en­gagement, for nothing was effected either by skill orprudence. The tide, indeed, might be said to havethe intire command, for it bore them down, sometimeson their own, sometimes on the Roman vessels, whilethey were endeavoring in vain to row in a contrarydirection; so that a ship which was flying might beseen whirled round by an eddy, and carried fullagainst the conqueror; while another, engaged in pur­suit, if it happened to fall into a contrary current,would be turned about as if for flight.

They therefore brought uptheir mounds to the walls, though by very difficult ap­proaches. On that side where the Romans attackedtheir ram demolished a considerable part of the wall;and the Macedonians having run together to defendthe, place, thus stripped of its works, a furious conflictensued. At first, by reason of the enemy's superiorityin number, the Romans were quickly repulsed; butbeing joined by the auxiliary troops of Attalus and theAchaeans, they restored the fight to an equality; sothat there was no doubt of their easily driving theMacedonians and Greeks from their ground, but thatthere were in the town a great multitude of Italian de­serters; some of whom, having been in Hannibal'sarmy, had, through fear of being punished by the Ro­mans, followed Philip; others, having been sailors,had lately quitted the fleets, in hopes of more honor­able employment: despair of safety, therefore, in caseof the Romans getting the better, inflamed these to adegree which might rather be called madness thancourage. Opposite to Sicyon is the promontory ofJuno Acrsea, as she is called, stretching out into themain, the passage to Corinth being about seven miles.To this place Philocles, one of the king's generals, led,through Boeotia, fifteen hundred soldiers; and therewere barks from Corinth ready to take these troops onboard, and carry them over to Lechasum.

Afterthese prayers, he threw into the sea, according to cus­tom, the raw entrails of a victim which had been slain,and gave by a trumpet the signal for sailing. The windbeing favorable and blowing fresh, when they set sail,they were soon carried out of sight of land; but aboutnoon a fog arose, which made it difficult to keep theships from running foul of each other. As they ad­vanced into the open sea, the wind abated: during thefollowing night the haziness continued, but at therising of the sun it was dispersed, and the wind fresh­ened. The pilot soon after told Scipio that ' Africawas not above five miles distant; that he saw the pro­montory of Mercury; and that if he gave orders tosteer thither, the whole fleet would be immediately inharbor.' As soon as Scipio came within sight of land,he prayed to the gods that his seeing Africa might behappy for the state, and for himself: he then gaveorders to make sail for another landing-place. Theyproceeded with the same wind ; but a fog arising, as onthe day before, hid the land from their sight; and in­creasing as the night came on, involved every object inobscurity. They therefore cast anchor, lest the shipsshould run foul of each other, or be driven on shore.At daybreak, however, the wind sprung up, dispersedthe fog, and discovered the coast of Africa.

These troops, after Hannibal wasvanquished, had been transported from Africa to Si­cily, and in about a year after, into Macedonia, as vo­lunteers: they denied, however, that this was donewith their consent, affirming, that they had been puton board the ships by the tribunes, contrary to theirremonstrances; but, in what manner soever they hadbecome engaged in that service, whether by compul­sion or not, the time of it was now expired, and it wasreasonable that some end should be put to their toils.For many years they had not seen Italy, but had grown

and the Rhodians pressed Philip vigorously, they mighthave acquired the illustrious title of the deliverers ofGreece; hut by suffering him to pass over again intoHellespontus, and to strengthen himself by seizing theadvantageous posts in Greece, they increased the diffi­culties of the war, and yielded up to the Romans theglory of having conducted and finished it.
16. Philip acted with a spirit more becoming aking; for, though he had found himself unequal tothe forces of Attalus and the Rhodians, yet he wasnot dismayed, even by the prospect of an approachingwar with the Romans. Sending Philocles, one of hisgenerals, with two thousand foot and two hundredhorse to ravage the lands of the Athenians, he gavethe command of his fleet to Heraclides, with orders tosail to Maronea, and marched thither himself by land,with two thousand foot lightly equipped, and twohundred horse. Maronea he took at the first as­sault; and, afterwards, with a good deal of trouble,got possession of jEnus, which was at last betrayed tohim by Ganymede, who commanded there for Pto­lemy. He then seized on other forts, Cypselus, Do-riscos, and Serrheus; and, advancing from thence tothe Chersonesus, received Elaeus and Alopeconnesus,which were surrendered by the inhabitants. Callipo-lis also and Madytos were given up to him, with se­veral forts of but little consequence. The people ofAbydus shut their gates against him, not sufferingeven his ambassadors to enter the place. The siegeof this city detained Philip a long time; and it mighthave been relieved, if Attalus and the Rhodians hadacted with any vigor. The king sent only three hun­dred men for a garrison, and the Rhodians one quadri-reme from their fleet, although it was lying idle atTenedos: and afterwards, when the besieged couldwith difficulty hold out any longer, Attalus, going overin person, did nothing more than show them somehope of relief being near, giving not any real assist­ance to these his allies either by land or sea.

The tribunes being appealed to, referredthe business to the senate. The senate voted that thepeople might act therein as they should think proper.Thus Caius Mamilius Vitulus was elected chief curio,being the first plebeian admitted into that office. Pub-lius Licinius, chief pontiff, compelled Caius ValeriusFlaccus, against his will, to be inaugurated flamen ofJupiter. Caius Lsetorius was created decemvir for theperformance of religious rites, in the room of QuintusMucius Scaevola, deceased. I should willingly passover in silence the reason of the flamen being forcedinto the office, laboring as he then did under a badcharacter, had he not afterwards acquired a very goodone. Caius Flaccus had spent his youth in idlenessand debauchery, and his vicious courses had drawn onhim the displeasure of his own brother Lucius Flaccus,and of his other relations; and Publius Licinius wasin hope of reclaiming him. Indeed, when his thoughtsbecame engaged in the care of the sacrifices and re­ligious performances, he quickly made such a completealteration in his conduct, from what it had hithertobeen, that, among all the young men of the time, noone was held in higher esteem, or more intirely ap­proved by the principal patricians, by his own family,and by all. This universal good character inspiringbim with a proper sense of his own worth, he asserteda privilege which had for many years been laid aside,on account of the unworthiness of former flamens, thatof having a seat in the senate. On his coming into thesenate-house, the pretor, Lucius Licinius, led bim out;on which he appealed to the tribunes of the commons,alleging that he only claimed an ancient privilege ofhis priesthood, which was conferred on the office offlamen, together with the purple-bordered robe and thecurule chair.

out from the city they should expiate several prodigieswhich had happened. On the Alban mount a statueof Jupiter, and a tree, standing near the temple; atOstia, a grove; at Capua, a wall, and the temple ofFortune; and at Sinuessa, a wall and gate, were struckby lightning. Farther, it was reported that the Albanwater flowed in a bloody stream; that, at Rome, in thecell of the temple of Fors Fortuna, an image, whichwas in the crown of the goddess, fell from her headinto her hands; that an ox spoke at Privernum; thata vulture, while the forum was crowded, flew downinto one of the shops; and that, at Sinuessa, an infantwas born whose sex was doubtful, such as are com­monly called in Greek (a language more manageablethan ours, particularly in the compounding of words,)Androgynes; that a shower of milk fell; and that aboy was born with the head of an elephant. Theseprodigies were expiated with the larger kind of vic­tims. Orders were given for a supplication to be per­formed at all the shrines, and prayers to be offeredduring one day, for the averting of misfortunes; anda decree passed that the pretor, Caius Hostilius, shouldvow and celebrate the games of Apollo, in like manneras they had of late years been vowed and celebrated.At the same time, the consul Quintus Fulvius held anassembly for the election of censors. The censorschosen were men who had never yet been consuls,Marcus Cornelius Cethegus and Publius SemproniusTuditanus. By direction of the senate the questionwas proposed to the people; and the people orderedthat these, by their censorial authority, should let tofarm the lands of Campania. The choosing of the se­nate was delayed by a dispute between the censorsabout the nomination of the prince of it: the makingthe choice had fallen, by lot, to Sempronius; but Cor­nelius alleged that he ought to observe the practicehanded down from their ancestors, which was to ap­point as prince the person who in the list of censorsstood the first of any then living, and this was TitusManlius Torquatus.

To this speech he added a re­solution equally harsh: that 'they should pass a votethat Quintus Pieminius, lieutenant-general, be broughtto Rome, and stand his trial in chains; and that, ifthe complaints of the Locrensians should appear to bewell founded, he should be put to death in prison, andhis effects confiscated: that Publius Scipio, on accountof his having gone out of his province without an orderof the senate, should be recalled; and that applicationshould be made to the tribunes of the commons to takethe sense of the people of the abrogating of his com­mission: that the Locrensians should be called in, andreceive this answer from the senate: that, as to theinjuries stated to have been done to them, neither thesenate nor the people of Rome approved of their beingdone: that they should be complimented with the ap­pellations of worthy men, allies, and friends: thattheir children, their wives, and whatever else hadbeen taken from them by violence, should be restored:that a search should be made for the intire moneywhich had been carried off from the temple of Proser­pine, and that double the sum should be replaced inthe treasury: that a solemn expiation should be per­formed, the college of pontiffs being first consulted onthis question: inasmuch as the sacred treasures hadbeen removed and violated, what atonements, to whatgods, and with what victims, should they be made?that the soldiers who were at Locri should be alltransported into Sicily; and that four cohorts of alliesof the Latine confederacy should be brought to Locrifor a garrison.' The collecting of the votes could notbe finished that day, the zeal of the parties for andagainst Scipio rising to a great degree of warmth; for,besides the crime of Pieminius, and the calamities ofthe Locrensians, the general's own manner of livingwas represented as so far from being Roman, that it

These ships were thus fitted up andprepared for the purpose of an attack on that side ofthe city which is washed by the open sea, which wasnow clear of the enemy; for the Carthaginian fleethad sailed over to Corcyra, at the time when Philipwas preparing to attack the jEtolians. Meanwhilethe party which carried on the siege of Caulon inBruttium, hearing of Hannibal's approach, and fearfulof being overpowered, retired to an eminence, which,though it secured them from an immediate attack, wasdestitute of every other convenience. In the prose­cution of the siege of Tarentum, Fabius received verygreat assistance towards the accomplishment of thatimportant business, from an incident trivial in appear­ance; the Tarentines had in the city a party of Brut-tians, given to them by Hannibal, and the commanderof this party was desperately in love with a young wo­man, whose brother was in the army of the consulFabius. This man, being informed by a letter frombis sister of her new acquaintance with a stranger ofso great wealth, and so highly honored among hiscountrymen, conceived hopes that by means of hissister her lover might be brought into any scheme;and this project he communicated to the consul: bisreasoning appeared not ill founded, and he was orderedto go as a deserter into Tarentum. Here being intro­duced by his sister to the notice of the commander, hebegan by artfully sounding his disposition, and havingsatisfied himself that his temper was as tickle as hecould wish, by the aid of female blandishments beprevailed on him to betray the post, of which he com­manded the guard. When both the method and thetime for the execution of this design were settled, thesoldier was let out of the town privately, through theintervals between the guards, and related to the con­sul what had been done, and what was farther in­tended.

At length he set out, with a number of recruits, tojoin the army, which he had left the year before atVenusia. Crispinus, observing the great degree offame which the taking of Tarentum had procured toMarcelhis, prepared to lay siege to Locri in Bruttium,sending to Sicily for engines and machines of all sorts,and calling over a fleet from thence, to attack thatquarter of the city which stretched down to the sea.But he laid aside his design of the siege, becauseHannibal had advanced to Licinium: he heard, too,that his colleague had led out his army from Venusia,which made him wish to unite their forces. Crispinustherefore withdrew from Bruttium into Apulia, andthe two consuls sat down in separate camps, distantfrom each other less than three miles, between Venu­sia and Bantia. Hannibal also returned into the samecountry, as soon as he had saved Locri from a siege.And now the consuls, being both impatient for action,offered battle almost every day; not doubting butthat, if the enemy would hazard an engagement withthe two consular armies united, they might effectuallyput an end to the war.
26. As Hannibal, of the two battles which he hadfought with Marcellus the year before, had gained oneand lost the other, he might now, in case of an en­gagement with the same antagonist, find reasonablegrounds both of hope and fear; but he could, by nomeans, believe himself equal to a contest with the twoconsuls together. Applying himself, therefore, whollyto his old artifices, he watched an opportunity for anambuscade. However, several skirmishes were foughtbetween the camps with various success, and the con­suls began to think that the summer might be spun outin this manner. They were of opinion, however, thatthe siege of Locri might, nevertheless, be prosecuted;and they wrote to Lucius Cincius to come over withthe fleet from Sicily to that place; and to carry on thesiege on the land side, they ordered half the troops ingarrison at Tarentum to march thither.

four horses, attended by the troops; Caius ClaudiusNero, on horseback, without troops.' As the unitingof their triumphs in this manner enhanced the glory ofboth the consuls, so it reflected peculiar honor on himwho condescended to appear in the procession, asmuch inferior to his colleague in magnificence, as hewas superior to him in merit. People said, that ' thecommander on horseback had, in the space of six days,traversed the extent of Italy, and had fought a pitchedbattle with Hasdrubal in Gaul, on the very day whenHannibal imagined he was lying in his camp oppositeto him in Apulia; that thus this single consul (equalto the defence of both extremities of Italy against twoarmies and two generals) had opposed against one, bisskill; against the other, his person. That the veryname of Nero had been sufficient to confine Hannibalto his camp; and as to Hasdrubal, by what othermeans than by the arrival of Nero had he been over­whelmed and cut off? The other consul, therefore,might proceed in his stately chariot: he was drawn,indeed, by a number of horses, but the real triumphbelonged to him who had only one; and that Nero,though he should go on foot, deserved to be for evercelebrated, both for having acquired so much glory inthe war, and shown so much indifference to the pomp­ous display of it in the present procession.' Withsuch encomiums did the spectators attend Nerothrough his whole progress to the capitol. The con­suls carried to the treasury three hundred thousandsesterces' in money, and eighty thousand asses2 ofbrass; to the soldiers, Marcus Livius distributed fifty-six asses3 each. Caius Claudius promised the samesum to his absent troops, as soon as he should returnto the army. It was remarked that the soldiers, onthat day, directed more of their military songs andverses to Caius Claudius than to their own com­mander; that the horsemen distinguished Lucius Ve-turius and Quintus Coecilius, lieutenants-general, byextraordinary praises, exhorting the commons to ap-

rounded on all sides, there was reason to think thatthe Roman might put an end to the war without stirringfrom his seat. Philip, however, considered, that afterhis cavalry had been defeated in two engagements, hecould with much less safety continue in the same post;accordingly, wishing to remove from thence, and atthe same time to keep the enemy in ignorance of hisdesign, he sent a herald to the consul a little beforesunset, to demand a truce for the purpose of buryingthe horsemen; and thus imposing on him, he beganhis march in silence, about the second watch, leavinga number of fires in all parts of his camp.
39. The consul had already retired to take refresh­ment, when he was told that the herald had arrived,and on what business: he gave him no other answerthan that he should be admitted to an audience earlythe next morning: by which means Philip gained whathe wanted, the length of that night and part of the fol­lowing day, during which he might march his troopsbeyond the enemy's reach. He directed his routetowards the mountains, a road which he knew the Ro­mans, with their heavy baggage, would not attempt.The consul, having at the first light dismissed the he­rald, with a grant of a truce, in a short time after dis­covered that the enemy had gone off; but not knowingwhat course to take in pursuit of them, he remained inthe same camp for several days, which he employed incollecting forage. He then marched to Stubera, andbrought thither, from Pelagonia, the corn that was inthe fields. From thence he advanced to Pellina, nothaving yet discovered to what quarter the Macedonianhad bent his course. Philip having at first fixed hiscamp at Bryanium, marched thence through cross­roads, and gave a sudden alarm to the enemy. TheRomans, on this, removed from Pellina, and pitchedtheir camp near the river Osphagus. The king alsosat down at a small distance, forming his intrenchmenton the bank of the river Erigonus. Having there re­ceived certain information that the Romans intendedto proceed to Eordaea, he marched away before them.

shouts of the soldiers: and that it might have been wellimagined that there was not a man left hehind either inItaly or in Sicily. Scipio took on himself the chargeof embarking the men in a regular manner. The sea­men were kept in order on board the ships by CaiusLaelius, who had the command of the fleet. The careof shipping the stores was allotted to Marcus Pompo-nius, the pretor. A quantity of food sufficient for forty-five days was put on board: as much of it ready-dressedas would serve for fifteen days. When all were em­barked, the general sent round boats to bring the pilotsand masters, with two soldiers out of each ship, to theforum, to receive orders. Being there assembled, hefirst inquired whether they had put water on board formen and cattle, and for as many days as they hadcorn: they answered that there was water on boardfor forty-five days. He then charged the soldiers that,attentive to their duty, they should behave themselvesquietly, so that the seamen might perform their busi­ness without interruption; informed them that he andLucius Scipio, with twenty ships of war, would protectthe transports on the right division ; and Caius Laalius,commander of the fleet, and Marcus Porcius Cato, thequest or, with the same number, those on the left: thatthe ships of war would carry each a single light, thetransports two; that the signal by night, on board theship of the commander-in-chief, would consist of threelights. The pilots had orders to steer to Emporium,where the land is remarkably fertile; consequentlythe country abounds with plenty of all things. Theinhabitants are unwarlike, as is generally the casewhere the soil is rich; and Scipio supposed that theymight be overpowered before succor could arrive fromCarthage. Having issued these orders, he commandedthem to return to their ships, and on the signal beinggiven next day, with the favor of the gods, to setsail.

in a close body. Thus Philip, having checked theproceedings of those two nations by these well-timedexpeditions, gained reparation for the damages sus­tained from the operations of the Romans; the enter­prise being as spirited as the issue was successful.An accidental occurrence lessened the number of hisenemies on the side of iEtolia. Scopas, a man ofconsiderable influence in his own country, having beensent from Alexandria by king Ptolemy, with a greatsum of gold, hired and carried away to Egypt, sixthousand foot and some horse; nor would he havesuffered one of the young jEtolians to remain at homehad not Damocritus, (it is not easy to say, whetherout of zeal for the good of the nation, or out of oppo­sition to Scopas, for not having secured his interestby presents,) by sometimes reminding them of the warwith which they were threatened, at other times, ofthe solitary state in which their country would be left,detained some of them. Such were the actions of theRomans and of Philip during that summer.
44. In the beginning of the same summer the fleetunder Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general, setting sailfrom Corcyra, and passing by Malea, formed a junc­tion with king Attalus, ofl" Scyllaeum, which lies in thedistrict of Hermione. The Athenian state, which hadfor a long time, through fear, restrained their animo­sity against Philip within some bounds, assuming con­fidence from the support now afforded them, gave fullscope to it without any reserve. There are neverwanting in that city orators, who are ready on everyoccasion to inflame the people; a kind of men, who,in all free states, and more particularly in that ofAthens, where eloquence florishes in the highest de­gree, are maintained by the favor of the multitude.These immediately proposed a decree, and the com­mons passed it, that 'all the statues and images ofPhilip, with their inscriptions, and likewise those ofall his ancestors of both sexes, should be removedand defaced; that the festival days, solemnities, andpriests, which had been instituted in honor of him or

The magistrates and prin­cipal inhabitants of the places in question being sum­moned to Rome, in pursuance of this decree of thesenate, and receiving the commands of the consuls re­specting the soldiers and the tax, they all declaredviolently against them, exclaiming, ' that it was im­possible for them to raise such a number of soldiers;they could scarcely accomplish it if their whole pro­perty were to be intreated by the regulation. Theybegged and intreated that they might be allowed toappear before the senate, and implore a mitigation oftheir sentence. They had been guilty of no crimethat deserved to be punished by their ruin; but, evenif they were to be ruined, neither their own guilt, northe resentment of the Roman people could make themfurnish a greater number of soldiers than they actuallyhad.' The consuls, unmoved, ordered the deputies toremain at Rome, and the magistrates to go home tomake the levies; assuring them, that ' they shouldhave no audience of the senate until they had strictlyfulfilled its orders. Their hopes of obtaining an au­dience being thus cut off, the levies were completedwithout difficulty; the number of young men in thosecolonies being much increased by their having been solong exempt from service.
16. Another affair also, and which had been almostas long passed over in silence, was proposed for con­sideration by Marcus Valerius Laevinus; who said,'it was highly reasonable that the several sums ofmoney which had been contributed by private persons,when Marcus Claudius and himself were consuls,should now be repaid.

28. The war commencing thus brilliantly with thissuccessful expedition, several petty kings and princes,whose dominions bordered on Macedonia, came to theRoman camp: Pleuratus, son of Scerdilsedus and Amy-nander, king of the Athamanians; and from the Dar-danians, Bato, son of Longarus. This Longarus hadin his own quarrel supported a war against Demetrius,father of Philip. To their offers of aid, the consulanswered that he would make use of the assistance ofthe Dardanians and of Pleuratus, when he should leadhis troops into Macedonia. To Amynander he allottedthe part of exciting the jEtolians to war. To the am­bassadors of Attalus (for they also had come at thesame time) he gave directions that the king shouldwait at jEgina, where he wintered, for the arrival ofthe Roman fleet; and when joined by that, he should,as before, harass Philip by such enterprises as hecould undertake by sea. To the Rhodians, also, anembassy was sent, to engage them to contribute theirshare towards carrying on the war. Nor was Philip,who had by this time arrived in Macedonia, remiss inbis preparations for the campaign. He sent his sonPerseus, then very young, with part of his forces toblock up the pass near Pelagonia, appointing personsout of the number of his friends to attend him, anddirect his unexperienced age. Sciathus and Pepare-thus, no inconsiderable cities, he demolished, fearingthey might fall a prey to the enemy's fleet; despatch­ing at the same time ambassadors to the jEtolians,lest that restless nation might change sides on thearrival of the Romans.
29. The assembly of the jEtolians, which they callPanaetolium, was to meet on a certain day. In orderto be present at this, the king's ambassadors hastenedtheir journey, and Lucius Furius Purpureo also ar­rived, being sent in like capacity by the consul.

medon appeared utterly inconsistent. He made lightof the war with the Romans; and asserted, that theissue of it would be similar to that of the former whichthey waged against Philip. If such be the case, whydoes he, at a distance, solicit our assistance, ratherthan come hither in person, and defend us, his old al­lies, both from Nabis and from the Romans? Us, doI say? Why, then, has he suffered Eretria and Ca-rystus to be taken? Why so many cities of Thessaly?Why Locris and Phocis? Why does he at presentsuffer Elatia to be besieged? Did he, either throughcompulsion, or fear, or choice, quit the straits of Epi-rus, and those impregnable fastnesses on the riverAous: and why, abandoning the possession of the pass,did he retire into his own kingdom? If, of his ownwill, he gave up so many allies to the ravages of theenemy, what objection can he make to these allies,after his example, taking care of themselves? Ifthrough fear, he ought to pardon the like fear in us:if his retreat was in consequence of a defeat, let meask you, Cleomedon, shall we, Achasans, be able towithstand the Roman arms, which you, Macedonians,have not withstood? Are we to give credit to yourassertion, that the Romans do not employ, in the pre­sent war, greater forces or greater strength than theydid in the former, or are we to regard the real facts?In the first instance, they aided the iEtolians with afleet; they sent not to the war either a consul as com­mander, or a consular army. The maritime cities ofPhilip's allies were in terror and confusion; but theinland places so secure against the Roman arms, thatPhilip ravaged the country of the JEtolians, while theyin vain implored succor from those arms. Whereas,in the present case, the Romans, after bringing to afinal conclusion the Punic war, which, raging for six­teen years in the bowels, as it were, of Italy, had giventhem abundance of trouble, sent not auxiliaries to thejEtolians in their quarrels, but, being themselves prin­cipals, made a hostile invasion on Macedonia with landand sea forces at once.

At the same time ashout was raised, and a prodigious tumult purposelymade, on every side where there was very little danger.Meanwhile the consul kept his men quiet and silent.Democrates therefore, who had formerly commandedthe fleet, and who happened now to command there,perceiving every thing near him quiet, while otherparts resounded with tumult and shouting like that ofa city stormed, fearful lest, while he hesitated, the.consul might force a passage and march in his troops,carried off his party to the citadel, because the mostalarming noise proceeded from that quarter. Fabius,from the length of time, and likewise from the silencewhich prevailed, (for where, a little before, there wasan uproar among the men rousing each other, and call­ing to arms, now not a word was heard.) imagined thatthe guard was withdrawn ; he therefore ordered theladders to be brought up to that part of the wallwhere, according to the information of the contriver ofthe plot, the cohort of Bruttians held the guard. In.this place, favored and assisted by the Bruttians, theRomans first gained possession of the wall, over whichthey climbed into the city; and then the nearest gatewas broken open, that the troops might march throughin a body. These entering the town a little before day,raised a shout, and without meeting any one in arms,proceeded to the forum, having drawn on themselvesthe attention of the combatants in every quarter, whe­ther at the citadel or the harbor.

in order to take possession of the defiles, and preventthe enemy from making their way, where the roads areconfined in narrow straits. There, with much labor,he fortified some places with a rampart, others with atrench, others with stones heaped up, instead of walls,others with trees laid across, according as the situationrequired, or as materials lay convenient; and thus aroad, in its own nature difficult, he rendered, as heimagined, impregnable by the works which he drewacross every pass. The adjoining ground, being mostlycovered with woods, was exceedingly incommodious tothe phalanx of the Macedonians, which is of no mannerof use except when they extend their very long spearsbefore their shields, forming as it were a pallisade; toperform which they require an open plain. The Thra-cians, too, were embarrassed by their lances, whichalso are of a great length, and were entangled amongthe branches that stood in their way on every side.The body of Cretans alone was not unserviceable; andyet even these, though in case of an attack made onthem, they could to good purpose discharge their ar­rows against the horses or riders, where they wereopen to a wound, yet against the Roman shields theycould do nothing, because they had neither strengthsufficient to pierce through them, nor was there anypart exposed at which they could aim. Perceiving,therefore, that kind of weapon to be useless, they an­noyed the enemy with stones, which lay in plenty inall parts of the valley: the strokes made by these ontheir shields, with greater noise than injury, for a shorttime retarded the advance of the Romans ; but quicklylearning to despise these weapons also, some closingtheir shields in form of a tortoise, forced their waythrough the enemy in front; others having, by a shortcircuit, gained the summit of the hill, dislodged thedismayed Macedonians from their guards and posts,and even slew the greater part of them, the difficultiesof the ground preventing their escape.

consul who was the nearest home, should be sent for,to be present at the proceedings; for as no subject ofgreater importance than the present could ever comeunder their consideration, so he did not think it con­sistent with the dignity of the Roman people, that anaffair of such magnitude should be transacted in theabsence of both the consuls.' Quintus Metellus, whothree years before had been consul, and had also beendictator, proposed, that 'whereas Publius Scipio, bydestroying the armies of the enemy, and wasting theircountry, had reduced them to such necessity, that theysued for peace. No person whatever could be a morecompetent judge of their intention in making the ap­plication, and therefore they should be wholly directedby the advice of that general, who was carrying onthe war under the walls of Carthage.' Marcus Vale­rius Laeviuus, who had been twice consul, chargedthose men with being come as spies, and not as ambas­sadors; and advised, that ' they should be ordered todepart from Italy; that guards should he sent withthem to their ships; and that orders should be sent toScipio, not to intermit his operations.' Laelius andFulvius added, that ' Scipio had grounded his hopes ofsuccess on Hannibal and Mago not being recalled fromItaly. That the Carthaginians would feign a compli­ance with any measures, while they waited for the ar­rival of those generals and their armies; and wouldafterwards, forgetting all gods and all treaties, how­ever recent, pursue the war.' This observation madethem more readily concur in the opinion of Laevinus.The ambassadors were therefore dismissed, and almostwithout an answer.
24. About the same time the consul, Cneius Servi-lius, not doubting bat that he should enjoy the gloryof having restored peace to Italy, passed over intoSicily in pursuit of Hannibal, (as if he himself hadcompelled him to retreat,) intending to proceed fromthence to Africa. As soon as this became known atRome, the senate at first voted that the pretor shouldwrite to the consul that they required him to return to

also got into his hands some towns of the Dassare-tians, and was besides endeavoring to persuade theDardanians to take arms. In consequence of this in­telligence, dropping the prosecution of the war be­tween the Achaeans and iEtolians, but leaving how­ever two thousand five hundred soldiers, of one sort orother, under the command of Menippus and Polyphan-tas, to assist his allies, he marched away from Dymae,through Achaia, Boeotia, and Euboea, and on the tenthday arrived at Demetrias in Thessaly. Here he wasmet by other couriers, with accounts of still more dan­gerous commotions; that the Dardanians, pouring intoMacedonia, had already seized on Orestis, and marcheddown into the plain of Argestee, and that a report pre­vailed among the barbarians that Philip had beenslain. This rumor was occasioned by the followingcircumstance:—In his expedition against the plunder­ing parties near Sicyon, being carried by the impetu­osity of his horse against a tree, a projecting branchbroke off one of the side ornaments of his helmet,which being found by an iEtolian, and carried intojEtolia to Scerdilaedus, who knew it to be the cogni­sance of the king, it was supposed that he was killed.After Philip's departure from Achaia, Sulpicius, sail­ing to jEgina, joined his fleet to that of Attalus. TheAchasans gained the victory in a battle with the JEto-lians and Eleans, fought near Messene. King Attalusand Publius Sulpicius wintered at jEgina.
33. Towards the close of this year the consul TitusQuinttus Crispinus, after having nominated Titus JVIan-lius Torquatus dictator, to preside at the elections, andsolemnise the games, died of his wounds, according tosome writers, atTarentum, according to others in Cam­pania. Thus was there a concurrence of events, suchas had never been experienced in any former war,while the two consuls being slain, without havingfought any memorable battle, left the commonwealth,as it were, fatherless.

Roman foragers, roving through the country, and con­ducted to the propretor, Quintus Claudius. At first,they eluded his inquiries by evasive answers; but, onbeing threatened with torture, fear compelled them toown the truth, and they confessed that they werecharged with a letter to Hannibal, With this letter,sealed as it was, the prisoners were given in charge toLucius Virginius, military tribune, to be conducted tothe consul, Claudius, and two troops of Samnite horsewere sent to escort, them. Claudius caused the letterto be read to him by an interpreter, and having ex­amined the prisoners, he concluded that the presentconjuncture of affairs was not of such a nature as torequire that the consuls should carry on the war ac­cording to regular plans, each within the limits of hisown province, by means of his own troops, and againstan antagonist pointed out by the senate; but that someextraordinary and daring stroke should be struck, suchas could not be foreseen or thought of, which at itscommencement might cause no less dread among theircountrymen than among the enemy; but, when accom­plished, would convert their great fears into as greatexultation. Wherefore, sending Hasdrubal's letter toRome, to the senate, he at the same time acquaintedthe conscript fathers with his intentions, advising that,as Hasdrubal had written to his brother that he wouldmeet him in Umbria, they should immediately callhome the legion then at Capua, raise new levies, andpost the city army at Narnia, to intercept the enemy.Such were the contents of his letter to the senate: forhimself, he sent on messengers, through the districtsof Larina, Marrucia, Frentana, and Pra?tntia, alongthe road which he intended to take with his army;giving directions that all the inhabitants should bringdown from their towns and farms victuals readydressed for the soldiers, and that they should furnishhorses and other beasts of burden, so that the wearymight be accommodated with easy transports.

yours resembles that of your father. He, in his con­sulship, after having gone to Spain, came back fromhis province to Italy, in order to meet Hannibal as hewas descending from the Alps: you, when Hannibalis in Italy, intend to quit the country, not because youjudge that measure useful to the state, but because youexpect from it splendor and glory to yourself. Just aswhen, without an order of the commons, without a de­cree of the senate, you left your province and yourarmy ;—yes, you, a commander employed by the Ro­man people, intrusted to two ships the fortune of thepublic, and the majesty of the empire, which werethen exposed to hazard in your person. In my judg­ment, conscript fathers, Publius Cornelius Scipio waselected consul for the purpose of serving us and thepeople, not for his own private schemes of ambition.In my opinion, the armies were enlisted for the pro­tection of the city and of Italy, and not to be carriedabout by the consuls with king-like ostentation, ingratification of their own vanity, and to any part ofthe world they may think proper.'
43. By this speech, formed for the occasion, by hisauthority and his established character for prudence,Fabius influenced a great part of the senate, especiallythose advanced in years; and a greater number ap­proving of the wariness of the sage than of the spiritof the youth, Scipio is said to have spoken thus:'Conscript fathers, even Quintus Fabius himself, in thebeginning of his speech, has acknowleged that, in thedeclaration which he has made of his sentiments, hemight possibly be suspected of detraction; and al­though I will not presume to bring a charge of such anature against so great a man, yet certainly, whetherthrough a defect in his discourse, or in the subject,the suspicion has not been removed. For, in order toavoid the imputation of envy, he has extolled his ownhonors, and the fame of his exploits, in very magnifi­cent terms; tending to show that whatever competitionI may enter into with others, however I may fearthat some person, now in obscurity, may one day be

The pretor and deputies proceed­ing to Locri, applied their first care, as they had beendirected, to the business respecting religion; andcausing search to be made for all the sacred money,appropriated both by Pleminius and the soldiers, theyreplaced it in the treasury together with the sum whichthey had brought with them, performing a solemn ex­piation. This done, the pretor calling the soldiers to­gether, ordered them to carry the standards out of thecity, and to form a camp in the plain; denouncing, byproclamation, severe penalties against any one whoshould either stay behind, or carry out with him anything that was not his own property; at the same timeauthorising the Locrensians to seize whatever belongedto themselves, and to search for such of their effects aswere concealed; above all, insisting that the freedom oftheir persons should be instantly admitted, with threatsof heavy punishment against any one who should disobeythis injunction. He then held an assembly of the Lo­crensians, and told them that 'the Roman people, andthe senate, restored to them their liberty and their laws.That if any one meant to bring a charge against Ple­minius, or any other person, he must follow them toRhegium: or if their state had to prefer a complaintagainst Publius Scipio, as being the author of thosecrimes which had been perpetrated at Locri againstgods and men, that they should then send deputies toRhegium also, and that he, with the council, wouldthere hear their cause.' The Locrensians returnedthanks to the pretor, to the deputies, and to the senateand people of Rome; declaring ' that they would pro­secute Pleminius: that, as to Scipio, although he hadshown but little feeling for the injuries done them, yethe was such a man as they would much rather have fortheir friend than their enemy: that they firmly berlieved the many shocking cruelties which had beenpractised were neither by the orders or with the ap­probation of Publius Scipio, who had only given toomuch credit to Pleminius, too little to them: that some

son, sent by Philocles to inquire what he meant, heonly answered, standing with his shield held out be­fore him, that he meant to die in arms in defence ofthe city intrusted to his charge. Philocles then or­dered some Thracians to throw their javelins at himand his attendants; and they were, every man of them,slain. Thus notwithstanding the alliance concludedby the Achaeans with the Romans, two of their cities,and those of the greatest consequence, Argos and Co­rinth, were still in the hands of Philip. Such werethe services performed in that campaign by the landand sea forces of Rome employed in Greece.
20. In Gaul, the consul Sextus jElius did nothingworth mention, though he had two armies in the pro­vince; one, which he had retained under their stand­ards, although it ought to have been disbanded; andof this, which had served under Lucius Cornelius, pro­consul, he had given the command to Caius Helvius,the pretor: the other he had brought with him. Hespent nearly the whole summer in compelling the peo­ple of Cremona and Placentia to return to their colo­nies, from whence they had been driven to variousplaces by the calamities of war. While Gaul, beyondexpectation, remained quiet through the whole year,an insurrection of the slaves was very near takingplace in the neighborhood of the city. The hostages,given by the Carthaginians, were kept in custody atSetia: as they were the children of the principal fa­milies, they were attended by a great multitude ofslaves; to this number many were added, in conse­quence of the late African war, and by the Setiansthemselves having bought, from among the spoil, se­veral of those which had been captured. Having con­spired together, they sent some of their number to en­gage in the cause their fellows of the country roundSetia, with those at Norba and Circeii. When everything was fully prepared, they determined, during thegames which were soon to be solemnised at the first-mentioned place, to attack the people while intent onthe show, and, putting them to death, to make them-

town, should put to the sword every one they metwithout distinction, whether Carthaginian or Spaniard.They instantly, therefore, threw open one of the gates,and rushed out of the town in crowds, holding theirshields before them, lest any weapons should be castat them, and stretching out their right hands expanded,to show that they had thrown away their swords.Whether this latter circumstance was unobserved on.account of the distance, or whether some stratagemwas suspected, is uncertain; but the deserters wereattacked as enemies, and put to death. Through thisgate the troops marched into the city in hostile array.The other gates were broken open with axes andsledges, and as soon as the horsemen entered, theygallopped forward to secure the forum, for such werethe orders; the veterans also were joined to the horseto support them. The legionary soldiers spread them­selves all over the city, but neither slew nor plunderedany, except those who stood on their defence. All theCarthaginians were put into confinement, with abovethree hundred of the inhabitants who had shut thegates; the rest had the town delivered up to them,and their effects restored. There fell in the assault,of the enemy, about two thousand; of the Romans,not more than ninety.
4. As the capture of this city afforded matter ofmuch exultation to those engaged in it, so it renderedtheir approach to the camp a magnificent spectacle tothe general and the rest of the army, on account of theimmense crowd of prisoners which they drove beforethem. Scipio having declared his approbation of hisbrother's conduct, and in the highest strains extolledhis taking of Orinx as equal to his own taking of Car­thage, led back his forces into Hither Spain. Theapproach of winter put it out of his power either tomake an attempt on Gades, or to pursue the army ofHasdrubal, now dispersed in all parts of the province.Dismissing therefore the legions to their winter quar­ters, and sending his brother Lucius Scipio with Hanno,the enemy's general, and other prisoners of distinction,

those colonies; and then, in the beginning of the spring,they set out to carry on the war. Quintus Ciecilius,consul, received his army from Caius Nero; LuciusVeturius, his from Quintus Claudius, propretor, hefilling it up with the new levies which himself hadraised. They led their forces into the territory ofConsentia. Here, having made great ravages, thetroops, now loaded with spoil, were thrown into suchconfusion, in a narrow pass, by some Bruttians andNumidian spearmen, that not only that spoil but them­selves were in extreme danger. However, there wasmore tumult than fighting; the booty was sent for­ward, and the legions without loss made their way toplaces of safety. From thence they advanced againstthe Lucanians, which whole nation returned without acontest into subjection to the Roman people.
12. No action took place during that year betweenthem and Hannibal; for the Carthaginian, after thedeep wound so lately given both to his own privateand to the public welfare, cautiously avoided throwinghimself in their way; and the Romans did not chooseto rouse him from his inactivity: such powers did theysuppose that leader possessed of, in his single person,though all things round him were falling into ruin.In truth, I know not whether he was more deservingof admiration in adversity or in prosperity; consider­ing that, though he carried on war for thirteen years,and that in an enemy's territory so far from home,with various success, with an army not composed ofhis own countrymen, but made up of the refuse of allnations, who had neither law, nor custom, nor languagein common; who were of different stature, had dif­ferent garb, different arms, different rites, and almostdifferent gods; yet he so bound them together by somecommon tie, that neither among themselves nor againsttheir commander did any sedition ever appear, al­though, in a hostile country, he often wanted both mo­ney to pay them and provisions also,—wants which, inthe former Punic war, had occasioned many distress­ful scenes between the generals and their men.

42. The next business attended to was that of theenvoys of Philip and the Carthaginians. It wasthought proper that the Macedonians should be firstintroduced. Their discourse comprehended a varietyof subjects: they first endeavored to clear themselvesof those matters, of which the ambassadors sent fromRome to the king had complained, relative to the de­predations committed on the allies. Then, on theirpart, they remonstrated on the conduct of the alliesof the Romans, and particularly on that of MarcusAurelius, who, they said, being one of the three am­bassadors sent to them, had stayed behind the rest,levied soldiers, committed hostilities against them, andfought several pitched battles with their commanders.They afterwards demanded that the Macedonians, andtheir captain, Sopater, who had served for pay underHannibal, and having been made prisoners were stilldetained, might be restored to them. In opposition tothis, Marcus Furius, who had been sent from Macedo­nia to Aurelius for the purpose, asserted, that ' Aure­lius had been directed to take care, lest the allies,wearied out by insults and depredations, should goover to the king: that he had not gone beyond theboundaries of the confederated states, but had endea­vored to prevent devastations being committed withimpunity within their territories : that Sopater was oneof the king's particular favorites, one of those distin­guished with the purple: and that he had been latelysent with four thousand men and a sum of money intoAfrica to the assistance of Hannibal and the Carthagi­nians.' The Macedonians being interrogated on thesepoints, and not giving any clear answers, the senate,without farther discussion, told them that 'the kingwas seeking war; and, if he persisted, would quicklyfind it. That the treaty had been doubly violated byhim: first, in offering injury to the allies of the Ro­man people, assaulting them in open hostilities; se-

to set out. A little before day the troops moved also,but stopped in a body at the gate, whence guards weresent round to all the other avenues, to prevent any onegoing out of the city. Those who had arrived the daybefore were then summoned to an assembly, and theyran together into the forum to the general's tribunal inthe most turbulent manner, intending to excite terrorby their tumultuous shouts. Just as the general wastaking his seat the troops, who had been recalled fromthe gates, spread themselves round, under arms, be­hind the unarmed assembly. On this all the arroganceof the latter sunk at once; and, as they afterwardsconfessed, nothing terrified them so much as the unex­pected vigor and complexion of the general, whomthey ha.d expected to see in a sickly state—his counte­nance showing more sternness, they said, than theyhad ever remembered to have seen even in battle. Hesat silent for a short time, until he was told that theauthors of the mutiny were brought into the forum,and that all things were prepared.
27. Then, a herald having commanded silence, hebegan thus: 'Never did I imagine that I should be inwant of language to address my own army: not that Iever gave more attention to words than to business;for, having lived in camps almost from my childhood, Iwas ever well acquainted with the soldier's way of think­ing. But, with what sentiments, or in what terms, Ishould speak to you, I am intirely at a loss. I knownot even what appellation I ought to give you.

The next day the ambassadors being againcalled, and, with severe rebukes for their perfidy,admonished, that, instructed by so many calamities,they should at length be convinced of the regard dueto the gods, and to an oath, these terms of peace wereprescribed to them:—' That they should live freeunder their own laws, should enjoy the possession ofwhatever cities, whatever territories, and whateverboundaries they possessed before the war; and thatthe Roman general would, on that day, put an end tothe devastation of their country. That they shoulddeliver up to the Romans all deserters, fugitives, andprisoners; and should surrender their ships of war,except ten, together with all their trained elephants,and should not train any more. That they shouldwage no war, either in, or out of Africa, without thepermission of the Roman people; should make resti­tution to Masinissa, and conclude a treaty with him;should supply corn and pay to the auxiliaries, untiltheir ambassadors should return from Rome. Thatthey should pay, within fifty years, ten thousand ta­lents of silver,i by equal payments, according to amode laid down in writing, and should give a hundredhostages to be approved of by Scipio, none youngerthan fourteen years or older than thirty. That hewould grant them a truce on this condition: that thetransports which had been captured during the formertruce, together with their cargoes, be restored: if thiswere not complied with, they were not to expect eithertruce or peace.' When the ambassadors, who weresent home with these conditions, reported them in anassembly of the people, Gisgo having stood forth todissuade them from accepting the terms, and beinglistened to by the multitude, who were as impatient ofquiet, as unfit for war, Hannibal, filled with indigna­tion on finding objections made and listened to at sucha juncture, laid hold of Gisgo with his hand, andpulled him down from the place on which he stood.

they proceeded, Hasdrubal first, then Scipio and Las-lius, on their way to the king.
18. Syphax considered this as a very honorable cir­cumstance, as it really was, that the generals of thetwo most powerful states of the age should come onthe same day to solicit peace and friendship with him.He invited them both to his palace, and as chance hadso ordered that they were under the same roof, and inthe protection of the same household gods, he en­deavored to bring them to a conference, for the pur­pose of putting an end to the enmity subsisting be­tween them. Scipio declared that in his private ca­pacity he had not the least ill-will to the Carthaginian,which might require a conference to remove it; andwith regard to public affairs, he could not enter intoany negotiation with an enemy without orders fromthe senate. However, the king showing an earnestdesire that he should come to the same table, so thatneither of his guests might seem to be excluded, hedid not refuse ; and they there supped together. Scipioand Hasdrubal, perceiving that it would be agreeableto their entertainer, even reclined on the same couchduring the repast; and so pleasing were the mannersof the former, such his pliability on every occasion, andsuch his engaging conversation, that he acquired theesteem not only of Syphax, a barbarian unacquaintedwith Roman habits, but even of his inveterate enemy,who declared publicly, that ' he appeared, on acquaint­ance, more worthy of admiration for his powers inconversation, than for his exploits in war; that hemade no doubt but Syphax and his kingdom wouldsoon be under the direction of the Romans.

was judged more suitable to his dignity to explain hissentiments in writing than, being present, to be forcedto blush, either at the recital of his extraordinary fa­vors to the state, or at the immoderate applause of themultitude, which would overwhelm his modesty withacclamations and other signs of approbation. In theletter which he sent, and which was read to the assem­bly, was contained, first, a recapitulation of the seve­ral acts of kindness which he had shown to the Athe­nian state, as his ally; then, of the actions which hehad performed against Philip; and lastly, an exhorta­tion to 'enter immediately on the war, while they hadhim, (Attalus,) the Rhodians, and the Romans also, toassist them:' not omitting to warn them, that 'if theywere backward now, they would hereafter wish in vainfor the opportunity which they neglected.' They thengave audience to the ambassadors of the Rhodians, towhom they were under a recent obligation for havingretaken and sent home four of their ships of War,which had been lately seized by the Macedonians.War was determined on against Philip with universalconsent. Unbounded honors were conferred on kingAttalus, and then on the Rhodians. At that time men­tion was made of adding a tribe, which they were tocall Attalis, to the ten ancient tribes; the Rhodianstate was presented with a golden crown, as an ac-knowlegement of its bravery, and the inhabitants withthe freedom of Athens, in like manner as Rhodes hadformerly honored that people. After this, king Atta­lus returned to jEgina, where his fleet lay. FromjEgina the Rhodians sailed to Cia, and thence toRhodes, steering their course among the islands, allof which they brought to join in the alliance, exceptAndros, Paros, and Cythnus, which were held by Ma­cedonian garrisons.

spoil which was landed from the ships, were inflamedwith a desire of passing over immediately; yet thismore important business was interrupted by one ofsmaller consideration, the recovery of Locri; which,at the time of the general defection of Italy, had re­volted to the Carthaginians. The hope of accomplish­ing this was kindled by a very trifling circumstance: theoperations in Bruttium were rather predatory excur­sions than a regular war; the Numidians having begunthe practice, and the Bruttians readily joining in it,not more from their connexion with the Carthaginians,than from their own natural disposition. At lengththe Romans themselves, by a kind of contagion, be­came equally fond of plunder; and, when not pre­vented by their officers, made excursions into the ene­my's country. By these, some Locrensians, who hadcome out of the city, had been surrounded, and carriedoff to Rhegium; and among whom were some artizans,who happened to have been often hired by the Cartha­ginians to work in the citadel of Locri. They wereknown by the chiefs of the Locrensians, who, havingbeen banished by the opposite faction which had givenup the city to Hannibal, had retired to Rhegium. Theprisoners, after answering many of their inquiries con­cerning affairs at home, gave them hopes that if theywere ransomed and sent back, they might be able toput the citadel into their hands; telling them that theyhad their residence in it, and were intirely trusted bythe Carthaginians. In consequence of this, the saidchiefs, who anxiously longed to return to Locri, in­flamed at the same time with a desire of revenge, im­mediately ransomed and sent home these men; havingfirst settled the plan for the execution of their project,with the signals which were to be given and observedbetween them at a distance. They then went them­selves to Scipio, to Syracuse, where some of the exileswere, and informing him of the promises made by theprisoners, inspired probable hopes of success.

engines placed along the walls, not only prevented theapproaches by land, but annoyed the enemy's ships intheir station. Afterwards a part of the wall beingthrown down, and the assailants having penetrated bymines to an inner wall, which had been hastily raisedto oppose their entrance, the besieged sent ambassa­dors to the king to treat of terms of capitulation. Theydemanded permission to send away the Rhodian qua-drireme, with the crew and the troops of Attalus inthe garrison; and that they themselves might departfrom the city, each with one suit of apparel; butPhilip's answer afforded no hopes of accommodation,unless they surrendered at discretion. When this wasreported by their ambassadors, it so exasperated them,rousing at the same time their indignation and despair,that, seized with the same kind of fury which had pos­sessed the Saguntines, they ordered all the matrons tobe shut up in the temple of Diana, and the free-bornyouths and virgins, and even the infants with theirnurses, in the place of exercise; the gold and silverto be carried into the forum; their valuable garmentsto be put on board the Rhodian ship, and anotherfrom Cyzicum, which lay in the harbor; the priestsand victims to be brought, and altars to be erected inthe midst. There they appointed a select number,who, as soon as they should see the army of theirfriends cut off in defending the breach, were in­stantly to slay their wives and children; to throw intothe sea the gold, silver, and apparel that was on boardthe ships, and to set fire to the buildings, public andprivate: and to the performance of this deed theywere bound by an oath, the priests repeating beforethem the verses of execration. Those who were of anage capable of fighting then swore to continue thebattle till they fell, unless victorious.

pio, well practised in wars, but utterly unacquaintedwith the storms of intestine commotions, was filled withanxiety on the occasion, fearing lest the army shouldexceed all bounds in transgressing, or himself in pu­nishing. For the present, he resolved to proceed ashe had begun, by gentle measures: having thereforedespatched collectors through the tributary states, hereceived reason to hope to be soon able to dischargethe arrears. An order was then published, that thetroops should come to Carthage to receive their pay,either in separate divisions or in one body, as theyshould choose. The mutiny, of itself abating in vio­lence among the Romans, was reduced to a state ofperfect tranquillity by the measures which the rebel­lious Spaniards suddenly adopted. Mandonius andIndibilis, on receiving information that Scipio wasalive, desisted from their undertaking, and returnedinto their own country, as there was now remainingneither countrymen nor foreigner to whom they couldlook, up for a concurrence in their desperate scheme.The soldiers, after revolving every plan, were of opi­nion that they had nothing left, except (what is notalways the safest retreat from bad counsels) the sub­mitting themselves either to the just anger of the ge­neral, or to his clemency, of which it was thought theyneed not despair. 'He had pardoned even enemies,with whom he had been engaged in battle: their mu­tiny had not been attended with any serious conse­quences; no lives had been lost, nor had any bloodbeen shed: therefore, as it had not in itself been vio­lent, it merited not a violent punishment.' Men'sminds are generally ingenious in palliating guilt inthemselves. They only hesitated, then, whether theyshould go and demand their pay in single cohorts or ina body. The majority voted that, as the safer way,they should proceed in a body.

exhibit a show of gladiators, which he had prepared incommemoration of the death of his father and uncle.The combatants exhibited on this occasion were not ofthat sort which the lanistae are wont to procure, a col­lection of slaves, or such free men as are base enoughto set their blood to sale. Every champion here gavehis service voluntarily, and without reward; for somewere sent by the princes of the country to show a spe­cimen of the bravery natural to their nation; somedeclared that they would fight to oblige the general;some were led by emulation and a desire of supe­riority to send challenges; and those who were chal­lenged, from the same motive, did not decline them;some decided by the sword controversies which theycould not, or would not, determine by arbitration,having agreed between themselves that the matter indispute should be the property of the conqueror. Notonly people of obscure condition, but men of charac­ter and distinction; Corbis and Orsua, for instance,cousins-german, having a dispute about the sove­reignty of a city called Ibis, determined to decide itwith the sword. Corbis had the advantage in regardto years. The father of Orsua, however, had been laston the throne, having succeeded to it on the death ofhis elder brother. Scipio endeavored to accommodatethe matter by calm discussion, and to assuage theirresentment; but they both affirmed that they had re­fused to submit it to their common relations, and thatthey would have no other judge, neither god nor man,but Mars. They severally preferred death in fight toa submission to the other's authority, the elder confi­dent in his strength, the younger in his activity; andso determined was their rage, that it was impossible toreconcile them. They afforded an extraordinary spec­tacle to the army, and a striking example of the evils oc­casioned by ambition. The elder, by experience in armsand superior skill, easily vanquished the ill-managedvalor of the younger. To this exhibition of gladiatorswere added funeral games, conducted with as much mag­nificence as the province and the camp could supply.

he entertained confident hopes that they would supporthis claim to the consulship, as if they were every oneof them to share the honor of it. That as to the expe­dition before them, that man must have forgotten hisown exploits who could consider it as a war: for hispart, he was really more concerned about Mago, whohad fled with a few ships, beyond the limits of theworld, into a spot surrounded by the ocean, than aboutthe Illergetians; for on that spot there was a Cartha­ginian general; and whatever forces might be there,they were Carthaginians. Here was only a band ofrobbers, and leaders of robbers; who, though theymight have courage sufficient for ravaging their neigh­bors' grounds, burning their houses, and seizing theircattle, would show none in the field, or in regular bat­tle; and who, whenever they should see an enemy,would rely more on their activity for flight, than ontheir arms. It was not, therefore, because he appre­hended any danger from thence that he had determinedto suppress the Illergetians before he left the province,but principally that such a heinous revolt should notescape without punishment: and also, that it mightnot be said that there was one enemy left in a countrywhich had been overrun with such bravery and suc­cess. He desired them, therefore, with the favor ofthe gods, to follow him, not to what could properly becalled a war, for the contest was not with a people onan equality wijh them, but to inflict punishment on aset of criminals.'
33. After this discourse he dismissed them, withorders to prepare for a decampment on the followingmorning. After a march of ten days, he arrived at theriver Iberus, which he passed, and on the fourth dayhe pitched his camp within sight of the enemy. Therewas a plain before him, encircled by mountains; intothis valley Scipio ordered,some cattle, taken mostlyfrom the surrounding lands, to be driven forward, inorder to provoke the savage greediness of the bar­barians; sending with them some light-armed troopsas a guard, and giving orders to Laelius, that as soon

In this year ambassadors from king Attalusmade an offering, in the capitol, of a golden crown oftwo hundred and fifty-six pounds weight, and returnedthanks to the senate, because Antiochus, complyingwith the requisitions of the Romans, had withdrawnhis troops out of Attalus' territories. During thissummer two hundred horsemen, ten elephants, andtwo hundred thousand pecks of wheat, were furnishedby king Masinissa to the army in Greece. From Sicilyalso, and Sardinia, large supplies of provisions weresent, with clothing for the troops. Sicily was thengoverned by Marcus Marcellus, Sardinia by MarcusPorcius Cato, a man of acknowleged integrity and pu­rity of conduct, but deemed too severe in punishingusury. He drove the usurers intirely out of theisland; and restricted or abolished the contributions,usually paid by the allies, for maintaining the dignityof the pretors. The consul, Sextus jElins, cominghome from Gaul to Rome to hold the elections, electedconsuls, Caius Cornelius Cethegus and Quintus Minu-cius Rufus. Two days after was held the election ofpretors; and this year, for the first time, six pretorswere appointed, in consequence of the increase of theprovinces, and the extension of the bounds of the em­pire. The persons elected were Lucius Manlius Vulso,Caius Sempronius Tuditanus, Marcus Sergius Silus,Marcus Helvius, Marcus Minucius Rufus, and LuciusAtilius. Of these Sempronius and Helvius were atthe time plebeian ediles. The curule ediles wereQuintus Minucius Thermus, and Tiberius SemproniusLongus.

But when the punishment of the of­fenders came to be known, supposing that their owncrime would be thought to demand an equal atone­ment, they called their countrymen to arms, and re­assembling the auxiliaries which had joined them be­fore, they marched out with twenty thousand footand two thousand five hundred horse into the territoryof Sedeta, where, at the beginning of the revolt, theyhad established a camp.
32. Scipio quickly conciliated the affections of hismen by his punctuality in discharging all arrears tothe guilty as well as to the innocent, and which wasstrengthened by the mildness of his discourse, and thebenignity of his countenance towards all without dis­tinction. Summoning an assembly on his departurefrom Carthage, after copious invectives against theperfidy of the petty princes then in rebellion, he de­clared that ' he was setting out to take vengeance fortheir crimes, with feelings very different from thosewhich he had lately experienced, while he was apply­ing a remedy to the error of his countrymen; thatthen he had, with grief and tears, as if cutting his ownbowels, expiated either the imprudence or the guilt ofeight thousand men by the death of thirty ; but now hewas proceeding with cheerfulness and confidence to thedestruction of the Illergetians: for these were neitherborn in the same land, nor connected with him by anybond of society ; and for the only connexion which hadsubsisted, that of good faith and friendship, they hadwickedly rent it asunder. That there was one circum­stance respecting his army which gave him great satis­faction, which was, their being all either of his owncountry, allies, or of the Latine confederacy: that therewas scarcely a single soldier in it who had not beenbrought thither from Italy, either by his uncle, CneiusScipio, the first of the Roman name who entered thatprovince, or by his father in his consulate, or by him­self: that they were all accustomed to the name andauthority of the Scipios: that he wished to carry themhome with him to a well-deserved triumph; and that

31. The Roman ambassador then addressed them tothis purport: 'The Macedonians first, and afterwardsthe Athenians, have obliged me to change intirely themethod of my discourse: for, on the one hand, theMacedonians, by introducing charges against the Ro­mans, when I had come prepared to make complaintof the injuries committed by Philip against so manycities in alliance with us, have obliged me to think ofdefence rather than accusation; and, on the otherhand, after the relation given by the Athenians of hisinhuman and impious crimes against the gods bothcelestial and infernal, what room is there left for meor any other to make any addition to the charge?You are to suppose that the same complaints are madeby the Cianians, Abydenians, JEneans, Maronites,Thasians, Parians, Samians, Larissenians, Messenians,on the side of Achaia; and complaints, still heavierand more grievous, by those whom he had it more inhis power to injure: for as to those proceedings whichhe censures in us, if they are not found highly meri­torious, let them not be defended. He has objectedto us, Rhegium, and Capua, and Syracuse. As toRhegium, during the war with Pyrrhus, a legionwhich, at the earnest request of the Rhegians them­selves, we had sent thither as a garrison, wickedlypossessed themselves of the city which they had beensent to defend. Did we then approve of that deed?or did we exert the force of our arms against thatguilty legion, until we reduced them under our power,and then, after making them give satisfaction to theallies, by their stripes and the loss of their heads, re­store to the Rhegians their city, their lands, and alltheir effects, together with their liberty and laws?

assured that every one whom they saw going out tobattle would meet death in the engagement. Theythen besought them, by the deities celestial and infer­nal, that mindful of their liberty, which must termi­nate on that day either in an honorable death or dis­graceful slavery, they would leave no object on whichthe enraged enemy could vent their fury. That theyhad fire and swords at their command; and that itwere better that their friendly and faithful handsshould consume those things which must necessarilyperish, than that the foe should insult over them withhaughty scorn.' To these exhortations they addeddreadful imprecations against any who should be di­verted from their purpose, either by hope or tender­ness; and then with rapid speed and violent impe­tuosity they rushed out through the open gates. Therewas none of the outposts strong enough to withstandthem, because nothing could have been less appre­hended than that they should dare to come out of thefortifications; a very few troops of horse, and thelight infantry, despatched in haste from the camp,threw themselves in their way. The encounter wasfurious, owing more to their impetuosity and resolu­tion than to any regular disposition. The horse, there­fore, which had first engaged, being discomfited, com­municated the terror to the light infantry; and thebattle would have reached to the very rampart, hadnot the main body of the legions drawn out their line,though there was very little time allowed them forforming. Even among their battalions there was someconfusion; while the Astapans, blinded with fury,rushed on against men and weapons with the mostdaring insensibility of danger. But in a short timethe veteran soldiers, too steady to be disturbed bysuch rash attacks, by killing the foremost, stopped theadvance of the next.

Syphax, seeing all his commanders and garri­sons expelled from thence, retired within his own ori­ginal dominions, but in no disposition to remain quiet.In his ambitious views he was spurred on by his queenand father-in-law; and indeed he possessed such abun­dance of men and horses, that a mind less barbarousand violent than his might well assume confidence;and when reflecting on the great strength of a king­dom, which had enjoyed prosperity for a long courseof years. Wherefore, collecting together all who wereable to bear arms, he distributed among them horsesand weapons: he divided the horsemen into troops,and the footmen into cohorts, as he had formerlylearned from the Roman centurions; and thus, withan army not less numerous than that which he hadbefore, but composed almost intirely of raw undisci­plined men, he advanced towards the enemy, andpitched his camp at a small distance from theirs. Atfirst a few horsemen advanced from the outposts tomake observations; these, being attacked with jave­lins, retreated to their friends. Skirmishing partiesthen came forth from both sides; and whichever ofthese were repulsed, their fellows, being inflamed withindignation, came up in greater numbers to their sup­port. This is generally the prelude to engagementsbetween the cavalry; hope encouraging the party whichprevails, and rage exasperating that which is worsted.Thus, on the present occasion, the fight having com­menced between small divisions, the eagerness of thedispute drew out at length the whole force of cavalryon both sides. While the contest lay intirely betweenthese, the Massesylians, whom Syphax sent out in im­mense bodies, could hardly be withstood.

ple, were introduced to the senate; who, to fulfil theengagements of the consul, bestowed rewards on themall. Mutines was even made a Roman citizen, anorder for that purpose being proposed to the commonsby a plebeian tribune, in pursuance of directions fromthe senate. While these matters passed at Rome,Marcus Valerius Messala, with fifty ships, arriving onthe coast of Africa before day, made an unexpecteddescent on the lands of Utica, which he ravaged to agreat extent; and, after taking many prisoners andother booty of every kind, reimbarked, set sail forSicily, and returned to Lilybasum, on the thirteenthday after he had left it. On examining the prisoners,the following particulars were discovered, and all, inorder, communicated by letter to the consul Laevinus,that he might know the real state of affairs in Africa.That 'there were at Carthage five thousand Numi-dians, commanded by Massinissa, son of Gala, a youngman of a very enterprising spirit; and that peoplewere employed in all parts of Africa, in hiring othertroops, which were to be sent to Spain, to Hasdrubal,in order that, with the most numerous army which he^could muster, and with all possible expedition, hemight pass over into Italy and join Hannibal. Thaton this measure the Carthaginians placed all theirhopes of success. That, besides this, they were fittingout a very great fleet for the recovery of Sicily, andthat the prisoners believed it would sail thither in avery short time.' When the letter containing this in­formation was read, it made so great an impression onthe senate, that they all concurred in opinion that theconsul ought not to wait for the elections, but to nomi­nate a dictator to hold them, and return without delayto his province. This plan was obstructed by a dis­pute which arose; for the consul declared that hewould nominate dictator Marcus Valerius Messala,who was then in Sicily commanding the fleet; but thesenate insisted that a dictator could not be nominatedwho was in any place out of the Roman territory,which extended not beyond the limits of Italy.

rather than to trust to us,) yet, becoming masters ofthe place, and by exertion of the same force setting itat liberty, we restored it to the inhabitants. At thesame time, we do not deny that Sicily is our province,and that the states which sided with the Carthaginians,and, in conjunction with them, waged war against us,pay us tribute and taxes; on the contrary, we wishthat you and all nations should know, that the condi­tion of each is such as it has deserved at our hands:and ought we to repent of the punishment inflicted onthe Campanians, of which even they themselves can­not complain? These men, after we had on their ac­count carried on war against the Samnites for nearseventy years, with great loss on our side; had unitedthem to ourselves, first by treaty, and then by inter­marriages, and the consequent affinities; and lastly,by admitting them to a participation of the rights ofour state, yet, in the time of our adversity, were thefirst of all the states of Italy which revolted to Han­nibal, after basely putting our garrison to death, andafterwards, through resentment at being besieged byus, sent Hannibal to attack Rome. If neither theircity nor one man of them had been left remaining, whocould take offence, or consider them as treated withmore severity than they had deserved? From con­sciousness of guilt, greater numbers of them perishedby their own hands than by the punishments inflictedby us. And while from the rest we took away thetown and the lands, still we left them a place to dwellin, we suffered the city which partook not of the guiltto stand uninjured; so that there is not visible thisday any trace of its having been besieged or taken.But why do I speak of Capua, when even to van­quished Carthage we granted peace and liberty? Thegreatest danger is, that by our too great readiness topardon such, we may encourage others to try the for­tune of war against us.

the coast of that state; and, intending from thence todouble the promontory, and bring round the fleet tothe very walls of the city, they were near being buriedin the waves by a furious storm. However, after beingdispersed, and a great part of the ships having losttheir rigging, they escaped on shore. This storm atsea was an omen of the kind of success which theywere to meet on land; for, after collecting their ves­sels together, and landing their forces, having madean assault on the city, they were repulsed with con­siderable loss, there being a strong garrison of theking's troops in the place. Being thus obliged to re­treat without accomplishing their design, they passedover to Canastrum in Pallene, and from thence, dou­bling the promontory of Torona, conducted the fleet toAcanthus. There they first laid waste the country,then stormed the city itself, and plundered it. Theyproceeded no farther, for their ships were now heavilyladen with booty, but went back to Sciathus, andfrom Sciathus to Euboea, whence they had first setout.
46. Leaving the fleet there, they entered the Malianbay with ten light ships, in order to confer with thejEtolians on the method of conducting the war. Si-pyrrhicas, the jEtolian, was at the head of the embassythat came to Heraclea, to hold a consultation with theking and the Roman lieutenant-general. They de­manded of Attalus that, in pursuance of the treaty, heshould supply them with one thousand soldiers, whichnumber he had engaged for on condition of their takingpart in the war against Philip. This was refused tothe yEtolians, because on their part they had formerlyshowed themselves unwilling to march out to ravageMacedonia, at a time when Philip, being employednear Pergamus in destroying by fire every thing sacredand profane, they might have compelled him to retirefrom thence, in order to preserve his own territories.Thus, instead of aid, the jfitolians were dismissed withhopes, the Romans making them large promises.

a regular battle. Wherefore, recalling his son, andthe guard posted at the pass of Pelagonia, in order tostrengthen his army by the addition of those troops, hethereby opened a passage into Macedonia for Pleura-tus and the Dardanians. Then, taking deserters forguides, he marched towards the enemy with twentythousand foot, and four thousand horse, and, at thedistance of somewhat more than two hundred pacesfrom the Roman camp, and near Ithacus, he fortifieda hill with a trench and rampart. From this place,taking a view of the Roman station in the valley be­neath, he is said to have been struck with admiration,both at the general appearance of the camp, and theregular disposition of each particular part, distin­guished by the order of the tents, and the intervalsof the passages, and to have declared, that, certainly,that was not a camp of barbarians. For two days, theconsul and the king, each waiting for the other's mak­ing some attempt, kept their troops within the ram­parts. On the third day the Roman led out all hisforces and offered battle.
35. But the king, not daring to risk so hastily a ge­neral engagement, sent four hundred Trallians, whoare a tribe of the Illyrians, as we have said in anotherplace, and three hundred Cretans; adding to this bodyof infantry an equal number of horse, under the com­mand of Athenagoras, one of his nobles honored withthe purple, to make an attack on the enemy's cavalry.When these troops arrived within a little more thanfive hundred paces, the Romans sent out the light in­fantry, and two cohorts of horse, that both cavalry andinfantry might be equal in number to the Macedonians.The king's troops expected that the method of fightingwould be such as they had been accustomed to; thatthe horsemen, pursuing and retreating alternately,would at one time use their weapons, at another timeturn their backs; that the agility of the Illyrians wouldbe serviceable for excursions and sudden attacks, andthat the Cretans might discharge their arrows as theyadvanced eagerly to the charge: but this plan of fight-

But as the twoconsular armies, without commanders, were so nearthe enemy, both the senate and people, laying asideall other concerns, made it their chief and only care tohave consuls elected as soon as possible, and especiallythat they should be men whose courage was so tem­pered by prudence as to guard them sufficiently againstCarthaginian wiles: for it was considered that, asthrough the whole course of the present war, the toowarm and precipitate tempers of their generals hadbeen productive of great losses, so, in that very year,the consuls, through excessive eagerness to engage theenemy, had fallen unguardedly into their snares; thatthe gods, however, compassionating the Roman nation,had spared the troops, who were guiltless of the fault,and had decreed that the penalty incurred by the rash­ness of the commanders should fall on their own heads.When the senate looked round for proper persons tobe appointed to the consulship, Caius Claudius Neroat once met their view as eminently qualified beyondall others. They then sought a colleague for him.They well knew him to be a man of extraordinaryabilities, but, at the same time, of a temper more san­guine and enterprising than was expedient in the pre­sent exigences of the war, or against such an opponentas Hannibal; and therefore they thought it necessaryto qualify his disposition by joining with him a man ofmoderation and prudence.

He fixed a beaconon Tisaeum, a mountain whose summit is of an immenseheight, that, by means of lights on these eminences,whenever the enemy made any attempt, he might,though distant, receive instant intelligence of it. TheRoman general and king Attalus passed over from Pe-parethus to Nicaea, and from thence sailed to the cityof Orcus, which is the first city of Euboea on the left,on the way from the bay of Demetrias to Chalcis andthe Euripus.
6. It was concerted between Attalus and Sulpiciusthat the Romans should assault the town on the sidenext the sea, and at the same time make an attack onthe king's forces on the land side. Four days afterthe arrival of the fleet the operations began. The in­termediate time had been spent in private conferenceswith Plator, who had been appointed by Philip to thecommand of the place. There are two citadels, onehanging over the coast, the other in the middle of thetown, and from this there is a subterraneous passageto the ocean, the entrance of which, next to the sea, iscovered with a strong fortification, a tower five storiesin height. Here the contest first commenced, and thatwith the utmost violence, the tower being well storedwith all kinds of weapons; these, with engines andmachines for the assault, having been landed from theships. While the attention and eyes of all were drawnto that side, Plator, opening one of the gates, receivedthe Romans into the citadel next the sea, of whichthey became masters in a moment. The inhabitants,driven thence, fled to the other citadel in the middleof the city; but troops had been posted there to keepthe gates shut against them; so that, being thus ex­cluded and surrounded, they were all either slain ortaken prisoners. In the mean time, the Macedoniangarrison making no resistance, stood in a compact bodyunder the walls. These men Plator (having obtainedleave from Sulpicius) embarked in some ships, andlanded them at Demetrias in Phthiotis; he himselfwithdrew to Attalus. Sulpicius, elated by his success

and, arriving unexpectedly, made himself master ofLarissa, except the citadel,—not that celebrated cityin Thessaly, but another, which they call Cremaste.Attalus also surprised jEgeleos, where nothing wasless apprehended than such an enterprise during thesiege of another city. The works at Oreus had nowbegun to take effect, while the garrison within werealmost spent with unremitted toil (keeping watch bothby day and night), and also with wounds. Part of thewall being loosened by the strokes of the ram, hadfallen down in many places; and the Romans, duringthe night, broke into the citadel through the breachwhich lay over the harbor. Attalus, likewise, at thefirst light, on a signal given from the citadel by theRomans, assaulted the city on his side, where greatpart of the walls had been levelled; on which the gar­rison and townsmen fled into the other citadel, andeven that they surrendered in two days after. Thecity fell to the king, the prisoners to the Romans.
47. The autumnal equinox now approached, and theEuboean. gulf, called Coela, is reckoned dangerous bymariners. Choosing therefore to remove thence beforethe winter storms came on, they returned to Piraeus,from whence they had set out for the campaign. Apus-tius, leaving there thirty ships, sailed by Malea toCorcyra. The king was delayed during the celebrationof the mysteries of Ceres, immediately after which healso retired into Asia, sending home Agesimbrotus andthe Rbodians. Such, during that summer, were theproceedings by sea and land of the Roman consul andlieutenant-general, aided by Attalns and the Rhodians,against Philip and his allies.

Then, again, when he was in possession of thestrait of Epirus, where, from the nature of the ground,his fortifications, and the strength of his army, hethought himself secure, Quintius drove him out of hiscamp; pursued him, as he fled into Thessaly; and,almost in the view of Philip himself, stormed the royalgarrisons and the cities of his allies.

Let us imaginethat we are treating with Antigonus, a prince of thegreatest mildness and equity, to whose kindness wehave all been highly indebted; would he require us toperform what at the time was impossible?

Eordaea; then, having laid waste the whole country,the consul withdrew into Elimea. From thence hemade an irruption into Orestis, and laid siege to thecity Celetrum, situated in a peninsula: a lake sur­rounds the walls; and there is but one entrance fromthe main land along a narrow isthmus. Relying ontheir situation, the townsmen at first shut the gates,and refused to submit; but afterwards, when they sawthe troops in motion, and advancing under cover oftheir closed shields, and the isthmus, covered by theenemy marching in, their courage failed them, andthey surrendered without hazarding a struggle. FromCeletrum be advanced into the country of the Dassa-retians, took the city Pelium by storm, carried off theslaves with the rest of the spoil, and discharging thefreemen without ransom, restored the city to them,after placing a strong garrison in it, for it lay veryconveniently for making inroads into Macedonia. Hav­ing thus carried devastation through the enemy's coun­try, the consul led back his forces into those partswhich were already reduced to obedience near Apol-lonia, from whence, at the beginning of the campaign,he had set out to begin his operations. Philip's atten­tion had been drawn to other quarters by the JElo-lians, Athamanians, and Dardanians: so many werethe wars that started up on different sides of him.Against the Dardanians, who were now retiring out ofMacedonia, he sent Athenagoras with the light infantryand the greater part of the cavalry, and ordered himto hang on their rear as they retreated; and, by cut­ting off their hindmost troops, make them more cau­tious for the future of leading out their armies fromhome. As to the jEtolians, Damocritus, their pretor,the same who at Naupactum had persuaded them todefer passing a decree concerning the war, had in thenext meeting roused them to arms, after hearing of thebattle between the cavalry at Octoloplms; the irrup­tion of the Dardanians and of Pleuratus, with the Illy-rians, into Macedonia; of the arrival of the Romanfleet, too, at Oreus; and that Macedonia, besides be-

was not even military; that ' he walked in the publicplace, having a cloak and slippers; that he gave muchof his time to books of entertainment, and the schoolsof exercise; and that his whole corps of officers, withequal indolence and effeminacy, indulged in all thepleasures of Syracuse; that Carthage was quite for­gotten among them; that the whole army, (debauchedand licentious, like that at Sucro in Spain, or that nowat Locri,) was more formidable to the allies than tothe enemy.'
20. These representations were compounded of amixture of truth and falsehood, yet carrying an ap­pearance of the former. The opinion of Quintus Me-tellus however prevailed; who, concurring with Maxi­mums in the other points, dissented from him in thatconcerning Scipio; affirming that 'it would be theheight of inconsistency, if the person whom, when buta youth, the state had some time since made choice ofas the only commander capable of recovering Spain;whom, after he had actually recovered it, they hadelected consul for the purpose of putting an end to thePunic war, and whom they conceived able to drawaway Hannibal from Italy, and even to subdue Africa!—that this man, as if he were Quintus Pleminius, shouldbe in a manner condemned without a trial, and sud­denly recalled from his province, he repeated, werehighly inconsistent. The abominable facts which theLocrensians complain of are not alleged to have beencommitted when Scipio was present; nor can any thingelse be laid to his charge than the having been tenderof the lieutenant-general, either through good natureor respect: that it was his opinion that Marcus Pom-ponius, the pretor, to whose lot Sicily had fallen,should, within the next three days, repair to his pro­vince: that the consuls should choose out of the senateten deputies, whom they should send along with thepretor, together with two tribunes of the people and anedile; and that, with the assistance of this council,the pretor should make an inquiry into the affair.

Heve them from all anxiety, as far as concerned Nabisand the Lacedasmonians; and that he would not onlysecure the lands of their allies from devastation, buttransfer the whole terror of the war on Laconia itself,by leading his army thither instantly. This discoursebeing received with general approbation, he added:'It is but reasonable, however, that while I am em­ployed in protecting your property by my arms, myown should not be exposed without defence; there­fore, if you think proper, provide such a number oftroops as will be sufficient to secure Orcus, Chalcis,and Corinth; that my affairs, being in a state of safetybehind me, I may proceed, without distraction, toattack Nabis and the Lacedasmonians.' The Achaeanswere not ignorant of the tendency of these kind pro­mises, and his offer of assistance against the Lacedae­monians, and that his view was to draw the Achaeanyouth out of Peloponnesus as hostages, that he mighthave it in his power to embroil the nation in a warwith the Romans. Cycliades, pretor, thinking that itwould answer no purpose to expose his scheme byargument, said nothing more than that it was notallowable, according to the laws of the Achaeans, totake any matter into consideration except that onwhich they had been called together; and the decreefor levying an army against Nabis being passed, hedismissed the assembly, after having presided in itwith much resolution and public spirit, although, untilthat day, he had been reckoned a partizan of the king.Philip, grievously disappointed, after having collecteda few voluntary soldiers, returned to Corinth, andfrom thence into the territories of Athens.

While Philip was in Achaia, Philocles, one ofthe generals, marching from Euboea with two thousandThracians and Macedonians, intending to lay wastethe territories of the Athenians, crossed the forest ofCithaeron opposite to Eleusis.

used and in the manner of fighting. When the Mace­donians, in close array, stretched out before them theirlong spears against the target fence which was formedby the close position of their antagonists' shields, andwhen the Romans, after discharging their javelinswithout effect, drew their swords, these could neitherpress on to a closer combat, nor cut off the heads ofthe spears; and if they did cut or break off any, theshaft being sharp at the part where it was broken,filled up its place among the points of those whichwere unbroken, in a kind of palisade. Besides this,the parts of the wall still standing, covered safely theflanks of the Macedonians, who were not obliged, eitherin retreating or in advancing to an attack, to passthrough a long space, which generally occasions dis­order in the ranks. An accidental circumstance alsohelped to confirm their courage; for as the tower wasmoved along a bank not sufficiently compacted, one ofthe wheels sinking into a rut, made the tower lean insuch a manner that it appeared to the enemy as if fall­ing, and threw the soldiers posted on it into consterna­tion and affright.
18. As none of his attempts met any sucoess, theconsul was very unwilling to allow the difference be­tween the two kinds of soldiery and their weapons tobe manifested in such trials; at the same time, hecould neither see any prospect of reducing the placespeedily, nor any means of subsisting in winter, atsuch a distance from the sea, and in a country deso­lated by the calamities of war. He therefore raisedthe siege; and as, along the whole coast of Acarnaniaand iEtolia, there was no port capable of containingall the transports that brought supplies to the army,nor any place which afforded lodgings to the legions,he pitched on Anticyra, in Phocis, on the Corinthiangulf, as most commodiously situated for his purpose.There the legions would be at no great distance fromThessaly, and the places belonging to the enemy;while they would have in front Peloponnesus, sepa­rated from them by a narrow sea; on their rear,

Theyhave already, more than once, engaged each other iupitched battles. Pleminius was leader of one party,the two military tribunes of the other; never did theyuse their weapons with more eagerness against theCarthaginians than on this occasion ; and, by their madproceedings, they would have afforded Hannibal anopportunity of recovering the possession of Locri, hadnot Scipio, whom we sent for, arrived in time to pre­vent it. It may be said, perhaps, that the subalternswho had been polluted by the sacrilege, were aloneagitated with frensy, and that no influence of the god­dess appeared in punishing the officers; whereas, infact, it has been here most conspicuous. The tribuneswere scourged with rods by the lieutenant-general;afterwards, the lieutenant-general was treacherouslyseized by the tribunes, and, his whole body beingmangled, and his nose and ears cut off, he was leftapparently lifeless. Recovering from his wounds, hethrew the military tribunes into chains, scourged them,made them suffer every kind of torture usually inflictedonly on slaves, put them to a cruel death, and thenprohibited them the rites of burial. Such penaltieshas the goddess exacted from the plunderers of hertemple; nor will she desist from harassing them withevery kind of frensy until the sacred money shall bereplaced in the treasury. Our ancestors, being en­gaged in a grievous war with the Crotonians, intended,because this temple lies without the walls, to removethe money therein deposited into the city; when avoice was heard by night, from the shrine, command­ing them to desist; for that the goddess would defendher own treasures.

was ordered to be sent into Macedonia to Quintius,together with three thousand seamen. Lucius QuintiusFlamininus was continued in the command of the fleet.To each of the pretors, for the two Spains, weregranted eight thousand foot, of the allies and Latines,and four hundred horse; and they were ordered todischarge the veteran troops in their provinces, andalso to fix the bounds which should divide the hitherfrom the farther province. Two additional lieutenants-general were sent to the army in Macedonia, PubliusSulpicius and Publius Villius, who had been consulsin that province.
29. It was thought necessary that before the con­suls and pretors went abroad some prodigies should beexpiated: for the temples of Vulcan and Summanus,'at Rome, and a wall and a gate at Fregellas, had beenstruck by lightning. At Frusino, during the night, alight like day shone out. At Asculum, a lamb wasborn with two heads and five feet. At Formiae, twowolves entering the town tore several persons who fellin their way; and, at Rome, a wolf made its way, notonly into the city, but into the capitol. Caius Acilius,plebeian tribune, caused an order to be passed thatfive colonies should be led out to the sea-coast; two tothe mouths of the rivers Vulturnus and Liternus; oneto Puteoli, and one to the fort of Salernum. To thesewas added Buxentum. To each colony three hundredfamilies were ordered to be sent. The commissionersappointed to make the settlements, who were to holdthe office for three years, were Marcus Servilius Ge-minus, Quintus Minucius Thermus, and Tiberius Sem-pronius Longus. As soon as the levies, and such otherbusiness, religious and civil, as required their personalattendance, was finished, the consuls set out for Gaul.Cornelius took the direct road towards the Insubrians,who were then in arms, and had been joined by theCaenomanians.

peaceable country round: and at length they used toquit their standards without leave, openly, and in theday-time. In a word, every thing was directed by thelicentious humor of the soldiery, nothing by the rulesand discipline of war, or the commands of the officers.The form however of a Roman camp was preserved,merely on account of the hope which they entertainedthat the tribunes would be infected with their madness,and become sharers in their mutiny and revolt. Theytherefore permitted them to hold their courts at thetribunals; they applied to them for the watchword,and mounted guards and watches in their turn ; and asthey had taken away all the power of command, so, bysubmitting from choice to the usual duties, they keptup the appearance of obedience to orders. But whenthey found that the tribunes disapproved and blamedtheir proceedings, that they endeavored to put a stopto them, and openly refused to assist in their designs,the mutiny then burst out; and having, by violence,driven the tribunes from their stands, and soon afterfrom the camp, with the unanimous approbation of thewhole body, they bestowed the supreme command onCaius Albius of Cales, and Caius Atrius of Umbria,common soldiers, who were the principal movers ofthe sedition. These men, not satisfied with the orna­ments used by tribunes, had the assurance to lay holdof the badges of supreme command, the rods and axes;never considering that their own backs and necks werein danger from those very rods and axes which theycarried before them to strike terror into others. Theirgroundless belief of Scipio's death blinded their under­standings; and they entertained not a doubt that, onthe news of that event, which would soon be generallyknown, the ffames of war would break out in everypart of Spain : that during this confusion money mightbe exacted from the allies, and the neighboring citiesplundered; and that the disturbances being general,and all men acting without restraint, their own beha­vior would be the less liable to observation.■ 2d.

from Sicily, and pass over to Macedonia. Accord­ingly, Marcus Valerius Laevinus, propretor, was sent;and, receiving thirty-eight ships from Cneius Octa-vius, near Vibo, he sailed to Macedonia, where, beingmet by Marcus Aurelius, the ambassador, and in­formed what numerous forces and what large fleetsthe king had prepared, and how busily he was em­ployed in prevailing on divers states to join him,applying to some in person, to others by agents, notonly through all the cities of the continent, but even inthe islands. Laevinus was convinced from this thatthe war required vigorous exertions on the side of theRomans; for, should they be dilatory, Philip mightbe encouraged to attempt an enterprise like to thatwhich had been formerly undertaken by Pyrrhus, whopossessed not such large dominions. He therefore de­sired Aurelius to convey this intelligence, by letter,to the consuls and to the senate.
4. Towards the end of this year the senate, takinginto consideration the lands to be given to the veteransoldiers, who under the conduct and auspices of Pub-lius Scipio had finished the war in Africa, decreedthat Marcus Tunius, pretor of the city, should, if hethought proper, appoint ten commissioners to surveyand distribute among them that part of the Samniteand Apulian lands which was the property of the Ro­man people. For this purpose were appointed, Pub-lius Servilius, Quintus Caecilius Metellus, Caius andMarcus Servilius, both surnamed Geminus, Luciusand Aulus Hosfilins Cato, Publius Villius Tappulus,Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, Publius JElius Partus, andQuintus Flaminius.

mountaineers. His army increased daily, the Gauls,induced by the greatness of his character, pouring infrom all sides. When the senate were informed ofthese proceedings by letters from Spurius Lucretius,they were filled with much anxiety, apprehending thatthe joy which they had conceived on the destructionof Hasdrubal and his army, two years before, wouldprove ill-founded, if another war, equal to the former,only under a different general, were to arise from thesame quarter. They therefore commanded MarcusLivius, proconsul, to march an army of volunteerslaves from Etruria to Ariminum, at the same timecharging the pretor, Cneins Servilius, if he judged itadvantageous to the state, to order the city legions tobe led into the field, by such commander as he shouldthink proper. Marcus Valerius Laevinus conductedthose legions to Arretium. About this time eightytransport ships of the Carthaginians were taken on thecoast of Sardinia by Cneius Octavius, who held thegovernment of that province. Caalius relates that thesewere laden with corn and provisions for Hannibal;Valerius, that they were carrying to Carthage theplunder of Etruria, and the Ligurian mountaineers,who had been made prisoners. In Bruttium, hardlyany thing memorable happened during that year. Apestilence had attacked both Romans and Carthagi­nians with equal violence, except that the Carthagi­nians, besides the disorder, were distressed by famine.Hannibal spent the summer near the temple of JunoLacinea, where he built and dedicated an altar, withan inscription in the Carthaginian and Greek charac­ters, containing a pompous recital of his exploits.

Thuswere Roman horsemen substituted in the place of thethree hundred Sicilians, without any expense to thepublic. The Sicilians had the trouble of instructingand exercising them; the general having ordered, thatany who did not perform this should continue in theservice. We are told that this proved an excellentbody of horse, and did good service to the state inmany battles. Afterwards, reviewing the legions, hechose out of them those soldiers who had been thelongest time in the army, especially those who hadserved with Marcellus; believing that they were notonly formed under the best discipline, but, in conse­quence of the long siege of Syracuse, were best skilledin the method of attacking towns; for the object towhich his views were now directed was no small mat­ter, being nothing less than the utter destruction ofCarthage. He then cantoned his army in the differenttowns; ordered in a supply of corn from the Sicilianstates, sparing what he had brought from Italy; re­paired the old ships, and sent Caius Laelius with themto Africa, to plunder the country; then hauled up thenew ones on land at Panormus, that they might lie dryduring the winter, because they had been hastily builtof green timber; and having completed the prepara­tions for the war, he came to Syracuse, where tran­quillity was not yet intirely re-established after thelate violent commotion. The Greeks, in pursuance ofa grant of the senate, demanding a restoration of theireffects from some Italians, who kept possession of themwith the same force with which they had seized them,Scipio, reckoning it essentially requisite to support thepublic faith, procured a restitution of the same; partlyby a proclamation issued, and partly by sentencespassed against those who persisted in retaining theirunjust acquisitions.

pus, commander of a cohort of mercenary auxiliaries,called the soldiers together in the forum, and orderedthe trumpets to sound an alarm from the citadel, thatall might be informed of the approach of the enemy.On which the people ran from all quarters to the gates,and afterwards to the walls. In a few hours after, andstill some time before day, Philip approached the city;and observing a great number of lights, and hearingthe noise of the men hurrying to and fro, as usual onsuch an alarm, he halted his troops, and ordered themto sit down and take some rest; resolving to use openforce, since his design of surprise had not succeeded.Accordingly he advanced on the side of Dipylos, orthe double gate, which being the principal entrance ofthe city, is somewhat larger and wider than the rest.Both within and without the streets are wide, so thatthe townsmen could form their troops from the forumto the gate, while on the outside, a road of about amile in length, leading to the school of the academy,afforded open room to the foot and horse of the enemy.The Athenians, who had formed their troops withinthe gate, marched out with Attalus' garrison, and thecohort of Dioxippus, along that road. This Philip ob­served, and thinking that he had the enemy in hispower, and might now satisfy his revenge in their de­struction, and which he had long wished for, (beingmore incensed against them than any of the Grecianstates,) he exhorted his men to keep their eyes on himduring the fight, and to take notice, that wherever theking was, there the standards and the army ought tobe. He then spurred on his horse, animated not onlywith resentment, but with a desire of gaining honor,reckoning it a glorious opportunity of displaying hisprowess in the view of an immense crowd whichcovered the walls, many of them for the purpose ofbeholding the engagement. Advancing far before theline, and with a small body of horse, rushing into themidst of the enemy, he inspired his men with greatardor, and the Athenians with terror.

Youhave long wished to deliver yourselves out of the handsof Philip, although you have not dared to make theattempt. Those have now crossed the sea, with largefleets and armies, who are able to set you at liberty,without any trouble or danger to yourselves. If youreject such allies, the soundness of your understand­ings may be called in question; but you must, unavoid­ably, have to deal with them, either as friends or foes.'22. This speech of the pretor was followed by ageneral murmur; some declaring their approbation,and others sharply rebuking those who did so. Andnow, not only individuals, but whole states engaged inaltercation; and at length the magistrates, called de-miurguses, who are ten in number, took up the disputewith as much warmth as the multitude. Five of themdeclared that they would propose the question concern­ing an alliance with Rome, and would take the voteson it; while five insisted that there was a law, bywhich the magistrates were prohibited from proposing,and the council from decreeing, any thing injurious tothe alliance with Philip. This day, also, was spent incontention, and there remained now but one day more'of the regular time of sitting; for, according to therule, the decree must be passed on the third day; andas that approached, the zeal of the parties was kindledinto such a flame, that scarcely did parents refrain fromoffering violence to their own sons. There was presenta man of Pallene, named Rhisiasus, whose son Mem-non was a demiurgus, and was of that party which op­posed the reading of the decree and taking the votes.This man, for a long time, intreated his son to allowthe Achaeans to take proper measures for their commonsafety, and not, by his obstinacy, to bring ruin on thewhole nation; but, finding that his intreaties had noeffect, he swore that he would treat him, not as a son,but as an enemy, and would put him to death with hisown hand.

in the Flaminian circus; and also, that the temples ofCeres, Safety, and Romulus, were struck by lightning.These prodigies the consuls were ordered to expiatewith the greater victims, and to perform a solemn sup­plication to the gods during one day; all which wasstrictly observed, in pursuance of a decree of the se­nate. But what struck more terror into men's mindsthan all these ominous and preternatural appearances,at home or abroad, was the extinction of the fire in thetemple of Vesta, and for which the vestal who had thewatch for that night was whipped to death by order ofthe pontiff Publius Licinius. Although this extinctionwas occasioned, not by the gods directing it as a por­tent, but by the negligence of a human being, yet itwas thought proper that it should be expiated by thegreater victims, and that a supplication should be so­lemnised at the temple of Vesta. Before the consulsset out to the campaign they received directions fromthe senate to 'take measures to make the commonpeople return to their lands in the country, where theymight now reside in safety, as, by the favor of thegods, the war had been removed to a distance from thecity of Rome, and from Latium; for it was quite in­consistent to pay more attention to the cultivation ofSicily than to that of Italy.' It was however no easymatter to obtain a compliance with this injunction:the laborers of free condition were most of them lostin the war, slaves were searce, the cattle had beencarried off in booty, and their dwellings thrown downand burnt. Nevertheless a great number, compelledby the authority of the consuls, returned as directed.The mention of this affair had been occasioned by de­puties from Placentia and Cremona, who complainedthat incursions were made on them by the neighboringGauls; that a great part of their settlers had dispersed;that their cities were thinly inhabited, and their terri­tory waste and deserted. A charge was given to thepretor Mamilius to protect the colonies from the ene­my.

The dictator and master ofthe horse, in pursuance of a decree of the senate, cele­brated the games of Ceres.
40. When the Roman deputies, together with theCarthaginian ambassadors, were come to Rome fromAfrica, the senate assembled in the temple of Bellona.Lucius Veturius Philo acquainted them (to the greatjoy of the fathers), that a battle had been fought withHannibal, in which the Carthaginians were finallyoverpowered, and an end put at last to that disastrouswar; he added, as a small accession to that greatand happy event, that Vermina, son of Syphax, hadalso been vanquished. He was then ordered to go outto the general assembly, and to communicate the joy­ful news to the people. On this, after mutual congra­tulations, a public thanksgiving being ordered, all thetemples in the city were thrown open, and a supplica­tion for three days decreed. The ambassadors of theCarthaginians, and of king Philip, for they also hadarrived, requesting an audience of the senate, the dic­tator answered, by order of the fathers, that the newconsuls would procure them an audience. The elec­tions were then held. [A. U. C. 051. B.

I therefore callon you, tribunes, to support me in refusing to give myopinion, and for this reason, that, although a majorityshould concur with me, yet the consul would appealfrom their judgment.' On this an altercation arose,Scipio insisting that it was unfair for the tribunes tointerpose, so as to prevent any senator from giving hisopinion on being asked it in his place. The tribunesdetermined thus: 'If the consul submits the regula­tion of the provinces to the senate, we are satisfiedthat their decision shall be final, and we will not sufferthat matter to be carried before the people; if he doesnot so submit it, we will support such as shall refuseto give their opinion on the subject.' The consul de­sired time until the next day, that he might conferwith his colleague, and the affair was then submittedto the senate, who decreed the provinces in this man­ner: to one consul, Sicily, and the thirty ships of war,which Caius Servilius had commanded the precedingyear, with permission to pass over into Africa, if heshould judge it for the advantage of the state; to theother, Bruttium, and the war against Hannibal, withthe army which Lucius Veturius, or that which Quin-tus Caecilius commanded; that these latter should castlots, or settle between themselves, which of themshould command in Bruttium, with the two legionswhich would be left by the consul; and that he, towhose lot that province fell, should be continued in itfor another year. The others also who were to havethe charge of armies, besides the consuls and pretors,had their commission prolonged. It fell by lot toQuintus Cascilius, that, in conjunction with the consul,he should manage the war against Hannibal in Brut*tium.

bal a furious conflict began, and dreadful slaughterwas made on both sides; for here were both the gene­rals; here the greater part of the Roman infantry andcavalry; here the Spaniards, veteran troops, and ac­quainted with the Roman manner of fighting; and theLigurians, a race of hardy warriors. To the same partthe elephants were driven, which, at the first onset,disordered the van, and made even the battalions giveground; but afterwards, the contest growing hotter,and the shouts louder, they soon became disobedientto the directions of their riders, rambling up and downbetween the two lines, without distinguishing theirown party, and ranging to and fro, not unlike shipswithout rudders. Claudius in vain attempted to ad­vance up the hill, often calling out thus to his men :—'To what purpose then have we, with so much speed,marched over such a length of way V However, see­ing it impracticable to reach the enemy's line in thatquarter, he drew away some cohorts from his rightwing, where the troops would not be able to act, andled them round behind the line. Then, to the surprisenot only of the enemy but of his friends also, he madea brisk attack on their right flank; and so quick werehis motions, that almost at the same instant when hismen appeared on the flank they likewise attacked therear. Thus the Spaniards and Ligurians were cut topieces on all sides, in front, and flank, and rear; andthe havoc in a short time reached the Gauls. Thesemade very little opposition ; for great numbers of themwere absent from their posts, having slipped away inthe night, and lain down in the fields; while those whowere present, being exhausted by fatigue and want ofsleep, and being naturally ill qualified to endure toil,had scarcely strength remaining sufficient to supporttheir armor. By this time it was mid-day; and whilethey were panting with heat and thirst, they were slainor taken at the will of the Romans.

appointed time; but neither Philip, nor any messagefrom him, came for several hours. At length, whenthey began to despair of his coming, his ships sud­denly appeared. He said that 'the terms enjoinedwere so severe and humiliating that, not knowing whatto determine, he had spent the day in deliberation.'But the general opinion was, that he had purposelydelayed the business, that the Achseans and jEtoliansmight not have time to answer him: and this opinionhe- himself confirmed, by desiring, in order to avoidaltercation, and to bring the affair to some conclusion,that the others should retire, and leave him to conversewith the Roman general: for some time, this was notadmitted, lest the allies should appear to be excludedfrom the conference. Afterwards, on his persisting inhis desire, the Roman general, with the consent of all,taking with him Appius Claudius, a military tribune,advanced to the brink of the coast, and the rest retired.The king, with the two persons whom he had broughtthe day before, came on shore, where they conversed aconsiderable time in private. What account of theirproceedings Philip gave to his people is not wellknown: what Quintius told the allies was, that ' Philipwas willing to cede to the Romans the whole coast ofIllyricum, and to give up the deserters and prisoners,if there were any. That he consented to restore toAttalus his ships, and the seamen taken with them;and to the Rhodians the tract which they call Peraea.That be refused to evacuate Iassus and Bargylii. Tothe jUtolians he was ready to restore Pharsalus andLarissa; Thebes he would keep: and that he wouldgive back to the Achasans the possession, not only ofArgos, but of Corinth also.' This arrangement pleasednone of the parties; neither those to whom the conces­sions were to be made, nor those to whom they wererefused; 'for on that plan,' they said, ' more wouldbe lost than gained; nor could the grounds of con­tention ever be removed but by his utterly evacuatingevery part of Greece.'

They thenseparated; some hastening to the temples of the godsto return thanks, some to their own houses, to impartthe happy news to their wives and children. The se­nate, in consideration of the consuls, Marcus Liviusand Cains Claudius, having cut off the general and thelegions of the enemy, decreed a supplication for threedays; which supplication the pretor, Cains Hostilius,proclaimed in the assembly, and it was performed withgreat devotion by all, both men and women. Duringthe whole three days, all the temples were equallyfilled with crowds, whose numbers never diminished;whilst the matrons, dressed in the most splendid man­ner, and accompanied by their children, being nowdelivered from every apprehension, just as if the warwere at an end, offered thanksgivings to the immortalgods. This victory produced also a powerful effect onthe internal business of the state; insomuch, that peo­ple immediately took courage to hold commerce witheach other as in time of peace, buying, selling, lend­ing, and paying money due. The consul Claudius, onreturning to his camp, ordered the head of Hasdrubal,which he had carefully kept and brought with him, tobe thrown before the advanced guards of the enemy;and the African prisoners, chained as they were, to beexposed to their view. Two of these he also unboundand sent to Hannibal, with orders to inform him ofwhat had happened. We are told that Hannibal,deeply struck by a disaster so fatal to his country, andhis house, said that he felt now the fortune of Car­thage. He then decamped, and retired thence, de­signing to draw together into Bruttium, the remotestcorner of Italy, all those confederates whom, whilescattered at wide distances, he could not protect; andhe removed from their own habitations, and carriedaway into Bruttium, all the Metapontines, and such ofthe Lucanians as acknowleged his authority.

ment which they must all expect, with a disgracefuldeath, were before their eyes. Farther, their couragewas inflamed by mutual emulation in toil and danger,and even by the sight of each other. Thus animated,they opposed the enemy with such determined bravery,that the army which had subdued all Spain was oftenrepulsed from the walls, and began, in a contest withthe youth of a single town, not much to their honor,to abate of their ardor. Scipio perceiving this, anddreading lest by these unsuccessful attempts the cou­rage of the enemy should be raised, and his own mendispirited, thought it necessary to exert himself inperson, and take a share in the danger. Whereon,reprimanding the troops for their want of spirit, heordered ladders to be brought to him, threatening tomount the wall himself, since the rest were backward;and, accordingly, he had already advanced near it,and not without danger, when a shout was raised onall sides by the soldiers, alarmed at the situation ofthe general, and the scalade was attempted at once.Laslius, too, pressed on at the other side. The inha­bitants were then no longer able to make opposition,and those who defended the walls being beaten off, theRomans took possession of them.
20. The citadel, too, during the tumult, being at­tacked on that side where it was thought impregnable,was taken. While the inhabitants were engaged indefence of those places where the danger appeared,and the Romans, in making greater approaches wherethey found it practicable, some African deserters, whowere then among the Roman auxiliaries, observed,that the most elevated part of the town, though pro­tected by a very high rock, was neither secured byany works, nor provided with men for its defence. Asthey were light of body, and very active from constantexercise, carrying iron spears along with them, theyclimbed up, by means of the irregular prominences ofthe rock; and when they met with a cliff too high andsmooth, by driving in the spikes at moderate distances,they formed a kind of steps.

Accounts of thesetransactions being carried to Messana, Scipio, a fewdays after, sailed over to Locri in a ship of six banksof oars; and having brought Pleminius and the tri­bunes to trial before him, he acquitted Pleminius, andcontinued him in the command of the place; adjudgedthe tribunes guilty, and threw them into chains, thatthey might be sent to Rome to the senate: he then re­turned to Messana, and went from thence to Syracuse.Pleminius, giving a loose to his rage, because hethought that the injury done him had been treated toolightly by Scipio, and that no other person was quali­fied to rate the penalty in such a case but he who hadsuffered the wrong, ordered the tribunes to be draggedbefore him. After having made them undergo the ut­most degree of torture which the human body is ca­pable of enduring, he put them to death; and not sa­tisfied with the punishment thus inflicted, he cast themout without burial. The like cruelty he used towardsthe chiefs of the Locrensians, who, as he heard, hadcomplained to Scipio of the treatment they had re­ceived at his hands. But the extreme severities whichhe had formerly practised on those allies through lustand avarice, he now multiplied through rage and re­sentment, bringing infamy and detestation not only onhimself, but on the general also.
10. The time of the elections was now drawing near,when a letter was brought to Rome from Publius Lici-nius the consul, stating that 'he and his army wereafflicted with a grievous sickness, and that they couldnot have stood their ground had not the disorder at­tacked the enemy with the same or even greater vio­lence.

space of a few days, taken these two important citiesof Eubeea, sailed round Sunium, a promontory ofAttica, and steered their course to Cenchrea, thegrand mart of the Corinthians. In the mean time theconsul found the siege of Atrax more tedious than hehad imagined, the enemy making an unexpected re­sistance. He had supposed that the whole of thetrouble would be in demolishing the wall, and that ifhe could once open a passage for his soldiers into thecity, the consequence would then be, the flight andslaughter of the enemy, as usually happens on thecapture of towns. But when, on a breach being madein the wall by the rams, and when the soldiers, bymounting over the ruins, had entered the place, thisproved only the beginning, as it were, of an unusualand fresh labor: for the Macedonians in garrison, whowere both chosen men and many in number, supposingthat they would be intitled to extraordinary honor ifthey should maintain the defence of the city by meansof arms and courage, rather than by the help of walls,formed themselves in a compact body, strengtheningtheir line by an uncommon number of files in depth.These, when they saw the Romans entering by thebreaches, drove them back, so that they were en­tangled among the rubbish, and with difficulty couldeffect a retreat. This gave the consul great uneasi­ness; for he considered such a disgrace, not merely asit retarded the reduction of a single city, but as likelyto affect materially the whole process of the war, whichin general depends much on the influence of events inthemselves unimportant. Having therefore clearedthe ground about the half-ruined wall, he brought upa tower of extraordinary height, consisting of manystories, and which carried a great number of soldiers.He likewise sent up the cohorts in strong bodies oneafter another, to force their way if possible throughthe wedge of the Macedonians, which is called a pha­lanx. But in such a confined space (for the wall wasthrown down to no great extent), the enemy had theadvantage, both in the kind of weapons which they

After many wounds given and received on bothsides, and numbers being slain, as in a regular engage­ment, darkness put an end to the fight.
11. While matters were in this state a herdsman,sent by Charopus, prince of the Epirots, was broughtto the consul. He said, that' being accustomed to feedhis herd in the forest, then occupied by the king'scamp, he knew every winding and path in the neigh­boring mountains; and that if the consul thought properto send some troops with him, he would lead them by aroad, neither dangerous nor difficult, to a spot over theenemy's head.' Charopus sent a message to the Ro­man, to give just so much credit to this man's accountas should still leave every thing in his own power, andas little as possible in that of the other. Though theconsul rather wished than dared to give the intelligencefull belief, and though his emotions of joy were stronglychecked by fear, yet being moved by the confidencedue to Charopus, he resolved to put to trial the favor­able offer. In order to prevent all suspicion of thematter, during the two following days he carried onattacks against the enemy without intermission, draw­ing out troops against them in every quarter, andsending up fresh men to relieve the wearied. Then,selecting four thousand foot and three hundred horse,he put them under the command of a military tribune,with directions to advance the horse as far as the na­ture of the ground allowed; and when they came toplaces impassable to cavalry, then to post them in someplain; that the infantry should proceed by the roadwhich the guide would show; and that when, accord­ing to his promise, they arrived on the height over theenemy's head, then they should give a signal by smoke,but raise no shout, until the tribune should have rea­son to think that, in consequence of the signal receivedfrom him, the battle was begun.

8. The new consuls, Sextus JElius Pastus and TitusQuintius Flamininus, on assuming the administration,[A. U. C. 554. B. C. 198] convened the senate in thecapitol, and the fathers decreed, that 'the consulsshould settle between themselves, or cast lots, for theprovinces Macedonia and Italy. That he to whomMacedonia fell should enlist, as a supplement to thelegions, three thousand Roman footmen, and threehundred horse; and also five thousand footmen, andfive hundred horsemen, of the Latine confederates.'The army assigned to the other consul was to consistintirely of new-raised men. Lucius Lentulus, consulof the preceding year, was continued in command, andwas ordered not to depart from the province, nor toremove the old army, until the consul should arrivewith the new legions. The consuls cast lots for theprovinces, and Italy fell to JElim, Macedonia to Quin­tius. Of the pretors, the lots gave to Lucius CorneliusMerula the city jurisdiction; to Marcus Claudius, Si­cily; to Marcus Poroius, Sardinia; and to Caius Hel-vius, Gaul. The levying of troops was then begun;for besides the consular armies, they had been orderedalso to enlist men for the pretors: for Marcellus, inSicily, four thousand foot and three hundred horse ofthe Latine confederates; for Cato, in Sardinia, threethousand foot and two hundred horse of the samecountry; with directions that both these pretors, ontheir arrival in their provinces, should disband the ve­terans, both foot and horse. The consuls then intro­duced to the senate ambassadors from king Attalus.These, after representing that their king gave everyassistance to the Roman arms on land and sea, withhis fleet and all his forces, and had hitherto executedwith zeal and alacrity every order of the consuls,added, that 'they feared it would not be in his powerto continue so to do, as he was much embarrassed byAntiochus, who had invaded his kingdom when the seaand land forces, which might have defended it, wereremoved to a distance.

ing such departure, though they had received ordersto that purpose from the senate. They had also muchanxiety concerning the final issue of affairs, now thatthe whole weight of the war fell on one general andhis army. About the same time ambassadors arrivedfrom Saguntum, bringing with them some Carthagi­nians who had come over to Spain to hire auxiliaries,and whom they had seized, together with .their money.They laid down in the porch of the senate-house twohundred and fifty pounds weight of gold and eighty ofsilver. The agents were thrown into prison; the goldand silver were returned, and thanks given to the Sa-guntines; presents were made to them besides, andships provided to convey them home to Spain. Someof the older senators then observed, that ' Men hadless lively sensations of good than of evil. Did theyremember what terror and consternation Hannibal'scoming into Italy had excited? What losses they hadsustained, and what lamentations had followed? Whenthe Carthaginian camp was seen from the walls of thecity, what vows were then offered up by each particu­lar person and by the whole body of the people!How often, in their assemblies, were their handsstretched out towards heaven, and exclamations heard—O! will that day ever arrive, when we shall seeItaly cleared of the enemy, and blessed once morewith the enjoyment of peace? That now, at length, inthe sixteenth year, the gods had granted their wish,and yet not the slightest proposal had been made ofreturning thanks to the gods. So deficient are men ingratitude, even at the time when a favor is received;and much less are they apt to retain a proper sense ofit afterwards.' Immediately, a general exclamationbroke forth from every part of the senate-house, thatPublius jElius the pretor, should take the sense of thesenate on the subject; and a decree passed, that a sup­plication should be solemnised in all the temples forfive days, and a hundred and twenty of the greatervictims offered in sacrifice.• 22.

Various stores were imported from Sicily andItaly; and besides the corn collected from all quartersof the adjacent country, Cneius Octavius, propretor,brought a vast quantity out of Sardinia from TiberiusClaudius, the pretor: in consequence of which, notonly the granaries already built were filled, but new oneswere erected. Clothing was wanted for the troops:that matter was given in charge to Octavius, with di­rections to apply to the pretor, and to try if any couldbe procured by him; a business which he carefullyattended to, for in a short time twelve hundred gownsand twelve thousand jackets were sent. During thesame summer in which these things passed in Africa,Publius Sempronius, consul, who had the province ofBruttium, on his march in the district of Croton,engaged Hannibal in a tumultuary battle, or rathera kind of skirmishing. The Romans were worsted;and one thousand two hundred of the consul's armyslain. The rest returned in confusion to the camp,which however the enemy did not dare to assault.During the silence of the following night Semproniusmarched away; and, having sent directions to Pub­lius Licinius, proconsul, to bring up his legions, hemade a junction of their forces: thus two commandersand two armies returned on Hannibal. Neither partydeclined an engagement; the consul deriving confi­dence from his forces being doubled; the Carthagi­nian, from his late victory. Sempronius led up hisown legions into the first line, those of Licinius wereplaced in reserve. In the beginning of the battle theconsul vowed a temple to Fortuna Primigenia, if heshould defeat the enemy on that day; and the objectof his vow was accomplished. The Carthaginianswere routed and put to flight: above four thousandfell, somewhat less than three hundred were madeprisoners, with whom were taken forty horses, andeleven military standards.

How much more florishing was Italy whenPyrrhus attacked it! How much greater its strength,possessing so many commanders, so many armies, whichthe Punic war afterwards consumed! Yet was he ableto give it a violent shock, and advanced victorious al­most to the gates of Rome: and not the Tarentinesonly, and the inhabitants of that tract of Italy whichthey call the greater Greece, whom you may supposeto have been led by the similarity of language andname, but the Lucanian, the Bruttian, and the Sam-nite revolted from us. Do you believe that thesewould continue quiet and faithful if Philip shouldcome over to Italy, because they continued faithfulafterwards, and during the Punic war? Be assuredthose states will never fail to revolt from us, exceptwhen there is no one to whom they can go over. Ifyou had disapproved of a Roman army passing intoAfrica, you would this day have had Hannibal and theCarthaginians to contend with in Italy. Let Macedo­nia, rather than Italy, be the seat of war. Let thecities and lands of the enemy be wasted with fire andsword. We have already found, by experience, thatour arms are more powerful and more successfulabroad than at home.

of the Roman people were not in possession of such anumber of fasces as Hannibal could have carried be­fore him of those which had been taken from the gene­rals who had fallen by his arms.' While their thoughtswere employed in these discouraging considerations,their anxiety and fears were farther aggravated byother circumstances; for after being accustomed duringseveral years to wage war in different parts of Italy,without any sanguine hopes or prospect of its speedyconclusion, Scipio and Hannibal, champions matchedas it were for the final decision, had now raised theireagerest attention. Even those who had the greatestconfidence in Scipio, and the strongest hopes of vic­tory, the nearer they saw the completion of theirwishes, the more was their solicitude heightened. Ina similar manner were the minds of the Carthaginiansaffected; who, when they turned their eyes on Hanni­bal, and the greatness of his exploits, repented thatthey had sued for peace. Then recollecting that theyhad been twice vanquished in battle; that Syphax hadbeen made prisoner; that they had been expelled fromSpain; and finally, that they had been obliged to quitItaly for the defence of their own shores; and that allthis had been effected by the valor and conduct of Sci­pio alone, they looked on him with terror, as a leaderwhose birth the fates had ordained for their destruc­tion.
29. Hannibal in the mean time arrived at Hadru-metum, and spent a few days there in refreshing hissoldiers after the fatigues of the voyage; when, rousedby the alarming accounts that all the country roundCarthage was possessed by the enemy's troops, he ad­vanced by long marches to Zama, which lies at the dis­tance of five days' journey from that city. Some spieswhom he sent out, being intercepted by the Romanguards, and brought to Scipio, he gave them in chargeto the military tribunes, with orders to conduct themthrough the camp, wherever they chose: he encouragedthem to lay aside fear, and view every thing; and then,inquiring whether they had taken a satisfactory view of

35. The ambassadors had not yet returned fromRome, nor was it known what were the sentiments ofthe Roman senate concerning war or peace; neitherwas the term of the truce expired. Scipio, on thisaccount, more highly resented the injury offered bythose who had petitioned for peace and the truce;and, considering it as breaking off the negotiations,and an infraction of the truce, he instantly sent Mar­cus Baebius, Lucius Sergius, and Lucius Fabius, am­bassadors to Carthage. These, having narrowly escapedsuffering violence from the populace, and still appre­hending themselves exposed to danger, applied to themagistrates, who had protected them from ill treat­ment, for a guard of ships on their return. Two tri­remes were assigned them; which, as soon as theycame to the river Bagrada, from whence there was aview of the Roman camp, returned to Carthage. Therewas a Carthaginian fleet stationed at Utica, from whichtwo quadriremes were sent, either in consequence ofprivate orders from Carthage, or Hasdrubal, who com­manded that fleet, (for the infraction was unauthorisedby the public,) and which suddenly attacked the Ro­man quinquereme as it came round the promontory.The Carthaginian vessels attempted to strike the Ro­man with their prows, but which they could not effectby reason of its activity, nor could the fighting menleap from those lower ships into the higher ones. Thequinquereme was gallantly defended, as long as wea­pons lasted. These, however, spent, there was nothingthat could save them but the land being near, and themultitude which poured out from the camp to thecoast. They therefore pressed forward, using theirutmost efforts with their oars; and running on shore,the men escaped, but the ship was intirely lost. Afterthe truce had been thus broken, by outrage after out­rage, Laelius and Fulvius arrived from Rome, with theCarthaginian ambassadors. To these Scipio declared,

Chap. I. When Scipio arrived in Sicily be formedhis volunteers into cohorts and centuries; of whichforces he kept three hundred about him, all of themvigorous young men, and ignorant of the purpose forwhich they were reserved, being neither inrolled inthe centuries nor supplied with arms. Then, out ofthe whole number of youths in Sicily, he chose alsothree hundred of distinguished birth and fortune ashorsemen, who were to pass over with him into Africa,appointing a day on which they were to attend, equippedand furnished with horses and arms. This service ap­peared to them very severe, being so far from home,and attended with great fatigues and great dangers,both by sea and land; so much so, that not only them­selves, but their parents and relations, were distressedwith anxiety on their account. At the time appointedthey brought their horses and arms to be inspected;Scipio then told them that ' he was informed that someof the Sicilian horsemen dreaded the service on whichthey were going, as laborious and severe; that if anywere thus affected he wished them to acknowlege itthen to him, rather than to complain afterwards, andprove inactive and useless soldiers to the state: hedesired them to express their sentiments freely, as­suring them they should be listened to without dis­pleasure.' On which one of them ventured to say,that if he had a free option, he certainly would wish todecline the service. Scipio replied, 'Since then, youngman, you have not dissembled your sentiments, I willprovide a substitute for you, to whom you must deliveryour horse, your arms, and other implements of war;take him hence directly to your house; exercise him,and take care that he be instructed in the managementof his horse and arms.'

19. Hasdrubal had, before the battle, hastily sentoff* his treasure; and now, forwarding the elephants,he collected the flying troops, directing his coursealong the river Tagus towards the Pyrenees. Scipiotook possession of the Carthaginian camp; and havingbestowed on the soldiers all the booty, except the per­sons of free condition, he found, on taking an accountof the prisoners, ten thousand foot and two thousandhorse. Of these he sent home all the Spaniards with­out ransom, the Africans he ordered the qnestor tosell. On this the multitude of Spaniards who stoodaround, both those who had formerly surrendered,and those taken the day before, unanimously salutedhim by the title of king. But Scipio, ordering thecrier to command silence, told them, that 'to him thehighest title was that of general, which his soldiershad conferred on him: that the title of king, in otherplaces highly respected, was at Rome deemed odious.They might, indeed, within their own breasts, judge ofhim as possessing the spirit of a king, if they deemedthat the most honorable perfection in a human mind,but they must refrain from the application of the name.'Even these barbarians were sensibly affected by thegreatness of his mind, that could look down contemp­tuously on a title which, from the rest of mankind, at­tracts wonder and admiration. He then distributedpresents among the petty princes and chieftains of theSpaniards, desiring Indibilis to choose, out of thegreat number of horses taken, three hundred, such ashe liked. While the questor, in pursuance of the ge­neral's order, was selling off the Africans, he observedamong them a boy of extraordinary beauty; and, hear­ing that he was of royal blood, he sent him to Scipio.

The consuls then cast lots for the provinces:Bruttium fell to Caspio, Etruria to Servilius Geminus.The provinces of the pretors were next put to the lot:Paetus iElius obtained the city jurisdiction; CneiusLentulus, Sardinia; Publius Villius, Sicily; Quin-tilius Varus, Ariminum, with two legions, which hadbeen under Lucretius Spurius. Lucretius remainedon his station, in order that he might rebuild the cityof Genoa, which had been'demolished by Mago theCarthaginian. Publius Scipio's command was conti­nued, not for a period limited by time, but by the bu­siness, until an end should be put to the war in Africa;and it was decreed that a supplication should he per­formed, to obtain from the gods, that his havingpassed into Africa might prove happy to the people, tothe general himself, and to the army.
2. Three thousand men were raised for Sicily; andbecause whatever strength it had possessed was car­ried over to Carthage, it was resolved that the coastof that island should be guarded by forty ships, lestany fleet should come thither from Africa. Villiuscarried with him to Sicily thirteen new ships; the restwere old ones repaired there. Marcus Pomponius,pretor of the former year (his command of this fleetbeing continued), took on board the new soldiers. Anequal number of ships were decreed by the senate toCneius Octavius, pretor likewise of the former year,with the same right of command, in order to protectthe coast of Sardinia. Lentulus, pretor, was orderedto supply the fleet with two thousand soldiers.

In the retinue of the embassy to Syphax he sent,instead of the common attendants, centurions of thefirst rank, of approved courage and prudence, dressedas servants; who, while the ambassadors were engagedin conference, might ramble through the camp, andobserve all the approaches and outlets; the situationand form, both of the whole and of the several parts ofit; where the Carthaginians lay, where the Numidians; .what distance there was between Hasdrubal's stationand the king's; and, at the same time, discover theirmethod of fixing outposts and watches, and whetherthey were more open to surprise by night or by day.Many conferences being held, care was taken to senddifferent persons at different times, in order that thegreater number might be acquainted with every cir­cumstance. These frequent conversations had led Sy­phax, and through him the Carthaginians, to entertaindaily more confident expectations of a peace, when theRoman ambassadors told him that 'they were orderednot to return to the general without a definitive an­swer; therefore, if his own determination was fixed,he should declare it; or if Hasdrubal and the Cartha­ginians were to be consulted, he should do it withoutdelay. It was time that either the terms of peaceshould be adjusted, or the war carried on with vigor.'While Syphax was consulting Hasdrubal, and Has­drubal the Carthaginians, the spies bad time to take aview of every thing, and Scipio also to make the pre­parations necessary to his design. From the mentionof accommodation, and their expectation of it, theCarthaginians and Numidians took not the necessaryprecautions against any attempt which the enemy mightmake. At length an answer was returned, in which,as the Romans appeared exceedingly anxious for peace,the Carthaginians took the opportunity of adding someunreasonable conditions, which afforded a plausiblepretence to Scipio, who now wished to break the truce.Accordingly, telling the king's messenger that 'hewould take the opinion of his council on the affair,'he answered him next day, that ' he alone had labored

Of the pretors, to Marcus Marciusfell the city jurisdiction; to Lucius Scribonius Libo,the foreign, and to the same person, Gaul; to MarcusPomponius Matho, Sicily; and to Tiberius ClaudiusNero, Sardinia. Publius Scipio's command was pro­longed for a year, with the same army and the samefleet he then had: as was also that of Publius Licinius,who was ordered to hold Bruttium, with two legions,as long as the consul should judge it to be for the in­terest of the state that he should continue in that pro­vince. Marcus Livius, and Spurius Lucretius, also heldon their commissions, with the two legions with whichthey had protected Gaul against Mago; and likewiseCneius Octavius, who, after delivering up Sardiniaand the legion to Tiberius Claudius, was, with fortyships of war, to defend the sea-coast, within suchlimits as the senate should appoint. To Marcus Pom­ponius, pretor in Sicily, two legions of the forces thathad been at Canua; were decreed; and it was ordered,that, of the propretors, (Titus Quintius and Caius Hos-tilius Tubulus,) the former should hold Tarentum, thelatter Capua, as in the former year, each with the oldgarrison. With respect to Spain, it was referred tothe people to determine on the two proconsuls whoshould be sent thither; when all the tribes agreed inordering Lucius Cornelius Lentulus and Lucius Man-lius Acidinus, in quality of proconsuls, to hold the

When this sight, unusual in a free state, raised a mur­mur among the citizens, he being accustomed to mili­tary manners, and disconcerted by their reception ofhim, said to them: 'At nine years of age I left thiscity, at the end of the thirty-sixth I have returned.The rules of war, I think, I perfectly understand,having from my childhood been continually suppliedwith opportunities of learning them, at some times bythe state of my own affairs, at others, by that of thepublic. The privileges, laws, and manners of the cityand of the forum you ought to teach me.' Havingthus apologised for his imprudence, he spoke at largeconcerning the peace, showing how necessary it was,and that the terms were not unreasonable. The great­est difficulty of all was that of the fleet, which hadbeen captured during the truce; nothing was to befound but the ships themselves, nor was it easy to col­lect the effects, those who were charged with havingthem in their possession making opposition to all thatwas proposed. It was at length resolved, that theships should be restored, that the men at all eventsshould be collected, and that the other matters whichcould not be produced, should be left to the valuationof Scipio, according to which the Carthaginians shouldmake compensation in money. Some say that Han­nibal, having gone from the field to the sea-coast,sailed immediately in a ship which had been prepared,and went to king Antiochus; and that when Scipiomade it a principal demand that Hannibal should begiven up to him, he was told that Hannibal had quittedAfrica.
38. On the return of the ambassadors to Scipio, thequestors were ordered to give in a return, extractedfrom the public accounts, of the public property whichhad been on board the ships; and the owners to makea return of the private property: for the amount ofthe value, twenty-five thousand pounds weight of sil­ver were required to be immediately paid, and a trucefor three months was granted to the Carthaginians.A clause was added, that during the truce, they should

The Calenian Al-bius, the Umbrian Atrius, and the other authors ofthat abominable mutiny, shall atone with their bloodfor the crime of which they have been guilty; and ifyou have recovered your sound judgment, the sightof their punishment will not only be not disagreeable,but even pleasing to you, for the tendency of theirschemes was as pernicious and destructive to your­selves as to any other persons whatsoever.' Scarcelyhad he finished his speech, when, according to a planpreconcerted, their eyes and ears were at once assailedby every object of terror. The troops which hadformed a circle round the assembly clashed theirswords against their shields; the herald's voice washeard citing by name those who had been condemnedin the council: they were dragged naked into themidst, and at the same time all the apparatus fordeath was produced; they were chained to the stake,beaten with rods, and beheaded; the spectators all thewhile standing so benumbed with fear, that not onlyno violent expression against the severity of the pu­nishment, but not even a groan was heard. Theywere then all dragged out, the place was cleared, andtheir fellows being summoned by their names, took theoath of obedience to Scipio before the tribunes of thesoldiers, at the same time receiving their pay. Suchwas the end and issue of the rising which began atSucro.

About the same time Hanno, Mago's lieutenant,having been sent from Gades with a small body ofAfricans, had, by tempting the Spaniards with money,collected four thousand young men in arms, near theriver Bsetis: but being afterwards beaten out of hiscamp by Lucius Marcius, and having lost the greatestpart of his forces in the tumult, and others also in theflight, (his disordered troops having been pursued bythe cavalry,) he made his escape with very few at­

troops should march by night, (the moon shiningthrough the whole of it,) and employ the day in takingfood and rest. The most liberal promises were madeto the guide, provided he fulfilled his engagement; hebound him, nevertheless, and delivered him to the tri­bune. Having thus sent off this detachment, the Ro­man general exerted redoubled vigor in every part tomake himself master of the posts of the enemy.
12. On the third day the Roman party made the sig­nal by smoke to notify that they had gained possessionof the eminence to which they had been directed; andthen the consul, dividing his forces into three parts,marched up with the main strength of his armythrough a valley in the middle, and made the wingson right and left advance to the camp of the enemy.Nor did these betray any want of spirit, but came outbriskly to meet him. The Roman soldiers, in the ar­dor of their courage, long maintained the fight on theoutside of their works, for they had no small superiorityin bravery, in skill, and in the nature of their arms;but when the king's troops, after many of them werewounded and slain, retreated into places secured eitherby intrenchments or situation, the danger reverted onthe Romans, who pushed forward, inconsiderately, intodisadvantageous grounds and defiles, out of which aretreat was difficult. Nor would they have extricatedthemselves without suffering for their rashness, hadnot the Macedonians first, by a shout heard in theirrear, and then by an attack begun on that quarter,been utterly dismayed and confounded at the un-thought-of danger. Some betook themselves to ahasty flight; some keeping their stand, rather becausethey could find no way for flight, than that they pos­sessed spirit to support the engagement, were cut offby the Romans, who pressed them hard both on frontand rear. Their army might have been intirely de­stroyed had the victors continued their pursuit of thefugitives; but the cavalry were obstructed by the nar­rowness of the passes and the ruggedness of theground; and the infantry by the weight of their ar-

He there­fore requested her to remember her father, the general,her country, and the two kings to whom she had beenmarried; and to take such steps as she should judgeproper.' When the servant, carrying this message andthe poison, came to Sophonisba,—' I receive,' said she,'this nuptial present, by no means an unacceptableone, if my husband has not the power to perform morefor his wife. Tell him, however, that I should havedied better had I not married in the very moment ofmy funeral.' The firmness with which she spoke wasnot greater than the resolution with which she receivedand drank off the contents of the cup. When Scipiowas informed of this event, dreading lest the youngman, whose passions were violent, might, in the pre­sent disorder of his mind, take some desperate measure,he sent for him instantly; and at one time consoled,at another gently chid him, for having atoned one actof rashness by another, and for having rendered theaffair more horrid than was necessary. Next day, inorder to divert his thoughts from the object which, atthe present, distressed him, he mounted his tribunal,and ordered an assembly to be summoned. There,after he had first honored Masinissa with the title ofking, and passed high encomiums on his merit, he pre­sented to him a golden crown, a golden goblet, a curulechair, an ivory sceptre, an embroidered robe, and avest striped with purple; enhancing the honor by say­ing that 'among the Romans there was nothing moremagnificent than a triumph, and that those who wereso distinguished had not a more splendid dress thanthat of which Masinissa alone, of all foreigners, wasesteemed worthy by the Roman people.'

on both sides were engaged; but night coming on, theyseparated, without any advantage being gained on eitherside. They then hastily, before it grew dark, fortifiedtheir camps, at a very little distance from each other.Next day, as soon as light appeared, Marcellus led outhis forces to the field; nor did Hannibal decline thecontest, but in a long speech exhorted his men to'remember Thrasymenus and Cannae, and to crush thepresumption of the foe, who pressed so closely ontheir steps; not suffering them either to march or en­camp in quiet, or even to breathe, or look about them. -Every day the rising sun and the Roman army ap­peared together on the plains. But if the enemy shouldonce be compelled to quit the field, especially withsome loss of blood, they would afterwards conduc.ttheir operations with less turbulence and violence.'Irritated by such expressions, and at the same timevexed at being continually harassed, on quitting theircamp they began the fight with great fury. The battlewas maintained for more than two hours; then, on theRoman side, the right wing and the chosen band, calledextraordinaries, began to give ground; on observingwhich Marcellus brought up the eighteenth legion tothe front. But, while the others were retiring in con­fusion, and these advancing with but little alacrityinto their place, the whole line was disordered, and ina little time totally broken: at last, fear getting thebetter of their shame, they fairly turned their backs.In this battle, and the flight which followed, there fellno less than two thousand seven hundred of the Ro­mans and allies; among these four Roman centu­rions, and two military tribunes, Marcus Licinius andMarcus Fulvius. Four military standards were lostby the wing which first fled, and two by the legionswhich advanced in the place of the flying allies.

those places in Illyricum of which he had possessedhimself by force, since the peace concluded in Epirus;and to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, the cities which hehad seized since the death of Ptolemy Philopater.These were the terms which he required, on behalf ofhimself and the Roman people: but it was proper thatthe demands of the allies also should be heard. Theambassador of king Attalus demanded 'restitution ofthe ships and prisoners taken in the sea-fight at Cius:and that Nicephorium, and the temple of Venus, whichPhilip had pillaged and defaced, should be put in astate of thorough repair.' The Khodians laid claim toPeraea, a tract on the continent, lying opposite to theirisland, which from early times had been under theirjurisdiction; and they required that 'the garrisonsshould be withdrawn from Tassus, Bargylii, and Eu-roma, and from Sestus and Abydos on the Hellespont;that Perinthus should be restored to the Byzantians,in right of their ancient title; and that all the seaporttowns and harbors of Asia should be free.' TheAchseans asserted their right to Corinth and Argos.Phasneas nearly repeated the demands made by theRomans, that the troops should withdraw out ofGreece, and the jEtolians be put in possession of thecities which had formerly been under their dominion.He was followed by Alexander, a man of eminenceamong this people, aud, considering his country, notuneloquent. He said that ' he had long kept silence,not because he expected that any business would beeffected in that conference, but because he was unwill­ing to interrupt any of the allies in their discourse.'He asserted that ' Philip had neither treated of peacewith sincerity, nor waged war with courage, at anytime: that in negotiating he was insidious and fraudu­lent: while in war he never fought on equal ground,nor engaged in regular battles; but, skulking about,burned and pillaged towns, and, when likely to bevanquished, destroyed the prizes of victory.

tachment to the Carthaginians, which they had formedduring the war, and in consequence, swelling with re­sentment. The state was to employ during that yearsix Roman legions.
9. In the midst of the preparations for war ambassa­dors came from king Ptolemy, with the following mes­sage :—that' the Athenians had petitioned the king foraid against Philip; but that although they were theircommon allies, yet the king would not, without thedirection of the Roman people, send either fleet orarmy into Greece, for the purpose of defending or at­tacking any person: that he would remain quiet in hiskingdom, if the Romans were at leisure to protect theirallies; or, if more agreeable to them to be at rest,would himself send such aid as should effectually se­cure Athens against Philip.' Thanks were returnedto the king by the senate, and this answer:—that ' itwas the intention of the Roman people to protect theirallies: that if they should have occasion for any assist­ance towards carrying on the war, they would acquaintthe king; and that they were fully sensible that, in thepower of his kingdom, their state had a sure and faith­ful resource.' Presents were then, by order of thesenate, sent to the ambassadors, of five thousand asses ito each. While the consuls were employed in levyingtroops, and making other necessary preparations, thepeople, prone to religious observances, especially atthe beginning of new wars, after supplications had beenalready performed, and prayers offered up at all theshrines, lest any thing should be omitted that had everbeen practised, ordered that the consul who was tohave the province of Macedonia should vow games,and a present to Jove. Licinius, the chief pontiff, oc­casioned some delay in the performance of it, allegingthat ' he could not properly frame the vow, unless themoney to discharge it were specified: for as the sumto be named could not be applied to the uses of thewar, it should be immediately set apart, and not to be

according to the custom of the Numidians, came to theking's brother iEsalces, who was far advanced in years.In a short time after, jEsalces also dying, Capusa, theelder of his two sons, the other of whom was veryyoung, got possession of his father's dominions: buthis title being supported, more by the regard paid tothe right of descent, than from any respect to his cha­racter, or any strength which he possessed, there stoodforth a person called Mezetulus, related by blood insome degree to the royal family. His progenitors,however, had always opposed their interests, and theirissue had, with various success, disputed the thronewith the branch then in possession. This man, havingroused his countrymen to arms, among whom his in­fluence was great, by reason of their dislike to thereigning dynasty, levied open war; so that the kingwas obliged to take the field, and fight for the crown.In that battle Capusa fell, together with a great numberof the principal men of the kingdom; while the wholenation of the Massylians submitted to the dominionand government of Mezetulus. He did not howeverassume the regal title; but satisfied with the modestone of Protector, gave the name of king to the boyLacumaces, the surviving son of him whom he hadslain. In hopes of procuring an alliance with the Car­thaginians, he took to wife a Carthaginian woman ofdistinction, daughter of Hannibal's sister, formerlymarried to king jEsalces; and sending ambassadors toSyphax, renewed with him an old connexion of hospi­tality, endeavoring, by all these measures, to secure asupport against Masiuissa.

The.king of the Moors at that time was Bocchar: applyingto him as a suppliant, he obtained, by the humblest in-treaties, four thousand Moors to escort him on hisjourney, not being able to prevail for any aid in thewar.

sent from Etruria, denounced this to be a portent par­ticularly horrid, that ought to be exterminated fromthe Roman territories, and without being suffered totouch the earth, drowned in the sea. Accordingly,they shut it up alive in a chest, and threw it into thedeep. The pontiffs likewise issued a mandate, thatthrice nine virgins should go in procession through thecity, singing a hymn. While they were employed inthe temple of Jupiter Stator, learning this hymn,which was composed by the poet Livius, the templeof Imperial Juno, on the Aventine, was struck bylightning. The aruspices, having delivered their judg­ment that this prodigy had respect to the matrons, andthat the goddess ought to be appeased by an offering,the curule ediles, by an edict, summoned together intothe capitol all those matrons who had houses in theeity of Rome, or within ten miles of it; and from thisnumber they chose twenty-five, to whom they paid ina contribution out of their own effects. With this mo­ney a golden basin was made, and carried to the Aven­tine, where the matrons, with every demonstration ofpurity and sanctity, immolated to the goddess. Im­mediately after, the decemvirs, by proclamation, ap­pointed a day for another sacrifice to the same divi­nity, which was conducted in the following order:—from the temple of Apollo, two white heifers were ledinto the city, through the Carmental gate; after themwere carried two cypress images of imperial Juno;then followed the twenty-seven virgins clad in longrobes, singing the hymn in honor of that deity. Thishymn might perhaps to the uninformed judgments ofthose times, appear to have merit, but, if repeated atpresent, it would seem barbarous and uncouth. Thetrain of virgins was followed by the decemvirs,crowned with laurel, and dressed in purple-borderedrobes. From the gate they proceeded through the Ju-garian street into the forum: here the processionhalted, and a cord was given to the virgins, of whichtbey all took hold, and then advanced, beating timewith their feet to the music of their voices.

to use every effort to raise the apprehensions of theenemy, so that Scipio might be induced to return home.To Mago they sent not only deputies, but twenty-fiveships of war, six thousand foot, eight hundred horse,seven elephants, and also a large sum of money to hireauxiliaries, whose support might encourage him to ad­vance his army nearer to the city of Rome, and effecta junction with Hannibal. Such were the preparationsand plans at Carthage. Whilst Laelius was employedin carrying off immense booty from the country, whichhe found destitute of arms and protection, Masinissa,roused by the report of the arrival of a Roman fleet,came to him attended by a few horsemen. He com­plained that 'Scipio was dilatory in the business;otherwise before that time he would have brought overhis army into Africa, while the Carthaginians were dis­mayed, and Syphax engaged in wars with his neigh­bors. That the latter was irresolute and undetermined;and that if time were allowed him to settle his own af­fairs as he liked, it would be seen that he had no sin­cere attachment to the Romans.' He desired him to'exhort and stimulate Scipio to activity;' assuring himthat 'he himself, though driven from his kingdom,would join him with no contemptible force, both ofhorse and foot.' He said that ' Lnelius ought not tomake any stay in Africa: that he believed a fleet hadsailed from Carthage, which it would not be very safeto encounter in the absence of Scipio. After this dis­course Masinissa departed; and next day Laelius setsail from Hippo, having his ships laden with spoil; and,returning to Sicily, delivered Masinissa's message toScipio.
5. About the same time, the ships which had beensent from Carthage to Mago arrived on the coast be­tween the country of the Albingannian Ligurians andGenoa, near which place the Carthaginian happened atthat time to lie with his fleet. On receiving ordersfrom the deputies to collect as great a number oftroops as possible, he immediately held a council ofthe Gauls and Ligurians (for there was a vast multi-

he respected him as the author of his liberty. I have notbeen able to discover whether it was the affection ofthe soldiers, or the attachment of the people, whichhonored Scipio with the surname of Africanus; norwhether it was brought into use by the flattery of hisfriends, as that of Felix given to Sylla, and of Magnusto Pompey, in the memory of our fathers. He wascertainly the first general distinguished by the title ofa nation which he had subdued.

Asto what concerns you, jEtolians, we entered into a warwith Philip on your account: you made peace withhim without consulting us. Perhaps you will say, thatwhile we were occupied in the Punic war, you wereconstrained by fear to accept terms of pacificationfrom him who possessed superior power; and that onour side, pressed by more urgent affairs, we suspendedour operations in a war which you had laid aside. Atpresent, as we, having, by the favor of the gods,brought the Punic war to a conclusion, have fallen onMacedonia with the whole weight of our power, soyou have an opportunity offered you of regaining aplace in our friendship and alliance, unless you chooseto perish with Philip, rather than to conquer with theRomans.'
32. After this discourse of the ambassador, the in­clinations of all leaning towards the Romans, Damo-critus, pretor of the jEtolians, (who, it was reported,had received money from the king,) without seemingto favor either party, said, that 'in consultationswherein the public safety was deeply interested, no­thing was so injurious as haste. That repentance, in­deed, generally followed, and that quickly, but yet toolate and unavailing; because designs carried on withprecipitation could not be recalled, nor matters broughtback to their original state. The time however fordetermining the point under consideration, which, forhis part, he thought should not be too early, might yetimmediately be fixed in this manner. As it had beenprovided by the laws, that no determination should bemade concerning peace or war, except in the Panae-tolic or Pylaic councils; let them immediately pass adecree, that the pretor, when he chooses to treat ofeither, may have full authority to summon a council;and that whatever shall be then debated and decreed,shall be, to all intents and purposes, legal and valid,as if it had been transacted in the Panaetolic or Pylaicassembly.'

While the battle betweenthe triremes was thus doubtful and irregular, beinggoverned intirely by chance, the Roman quinquereme,more manageable, either from being steadier on ac­count of its great weight, or from making its waythrough the eddies by its superior number of rowers,sunk two triremes, and brushing along close by athird, swept off the oars on the one side, handlingroughly some others which it had overtaken: butAdherbal crowded sail, and with the five remainingships escaped to Africa.
31. Laelius returning victorious to Carteja, and hav­ing learned there what had passed at Gades, (that theplot had been discovered, the conspirators sent toCarthage, and the hopes which had invited them thi­ther intirely frustrated,) he sent to acquaint LuciusMarcius, that he was of opinion that they ought to re­turn to the general, unless they chose to waste time tono purpose lying before Gades. Marcius assenting,they both returned to Carthage. A few days after,by their departure, Mago not only gained a respitefrom the dangers which had environed him both bysea and land, but on hearing of the rebellion of theIllergetians, he even conceived hopes of recoveringSpain. He sent messengers to the senate at Carthage,with instructions to exaggerate both the intestine dis­sension in the Roman camp, and the defection of theallies; and to exhort them to send such supplies asshould enable him to recover the empire of Spain,which had been transmitted to them by their ances­tors. Mandonius and Indibilis, returning into theirown territories, kept themselves quiet for some time,not knowing what to determine, until they could learnwhat measures were taken with regard to the mutiny;for if pardon were granted by Scipio to his country­men, they did not doubt but that it would extend to

After a meeting with their friends, on makinga second request, that liberty might be allowed themto ransom such of them as they chose, they were or­dered to give in a list of their names; and when theyhad given in about two hundred, a decree of the senatewas passed, that' the Roman ambassadors should carrytwo hundred of the prisoners, such as the Carthagi­nians should select, into Africa, to Publius CorneliusScipio, and give him directions, that if peace wereconcluded, he should restore them without ransom tothe Carthaginians.' The heralds being ordered to goto Africa to ratify the treaty, at their desire the senatepassed a decree in these words: that 'they shouldcarry with them flint stones of their own, and vervainof their own: that the Roman commander should givethem the order to strike the treaty, and that theyshould call on him for the herbs.' This was a kind ofherb brought from the capital, and given to the heraldson such occasions. The deputies being dismissed fromRome in this manner, as soon as they came to Scipioin Africa, concluded a peace on the terms before men­tioned. The Carthaginians delivered up the ships ofwar, elephants, deserters, fugitives, and four thousandprisoners, among whom was Quintus Terentius Culleo,a senator. The ships Scipio ordered to be carriedout into the deep, and burned. Some say that theyamounted to five hundred, of all sorts, which wereworked with oars; and that the sudden sight of thesein flames was as great a shock to the Carthaginians, asif Carthage itself had been set on fire. The deserterswere treated with more severity than the fugitives;those who were of the Latine confederacy were be­headed, the Romans were crucified.

and a part of the wall demolished by the enemy's works,they became disposed to capitulate. But they had agarrison of Macedonians, of whom they stood in noless dread than of the Romans; and Philocles, theking's general, sent frequent messages from Chalcis,that he would bring them succor in due time, if theycould hold out the siege. The hope of this, in con­junction with their fears, obliged them to protract thetime longer than was consistent either with their wishesor their strength. However, having learned soon afterthat Philocles had been repulsed in the attempt, andforced to fly back in disorder to Chalcis, they instantlysent deputies to Attalns to beg pardon and protection.While intent on the prospect of peace, they remittedtheir diligence in the duties of war, and kept armedguards in that quarter only where the breach had beenmade in the wall, neglecting all the rest; Quintiusmade an assault by night on the side where it was leastapprehended, and carried the town by scalade. Thetownsmen, with their wives and children, fled into thecitadel, but soon after surrendered themselves pri­soners. The quantity of money, of gold and silvertaken, was not great. Of statues and pictures, theworks of ancient artists, and other ornaments of thatkind, a greater number was found than could be ex­pected, either from the size of the city, or its opulencein other particulars.

They considered howeveT that he had been vanquished,and put to flight in several battles in Spain by thissame Scipio; and that, as a commander, he was nomore to be equalled with the Roman general, thantheir tumultuary forces were with the Roman army.The people were therefore called to arms, as thoughScipio were ready to attack the city; the gates werehastily shut, armed men placed on the walls, andwatches and outposts fixed, together with a regularguard, during the following night. Next day fivehundred horsemen, who were despatched to gain in­telligence, and to disturb the enemy on their landing,fell in with the advanced guards of the Romans: forScipio, having sent his fleet to Utica, and proceededto some distance from the coast, had seized on thenext high grounds, placing outposts of cavalry inproper places, and sending others into the country toplunder.
29. These, having met with the Carthaginian horse­men, slew a small number of them in fight, and thegreater part of the remainder, as they pursued themflying; among whom was Hanno their commander, ayoung man of distinction. Scipio not only laid wastethe country round, but captured also a very wealthycity which lay near him; in which, besides otherthings which were immediately put on board thetransports and sent to Sicily, there were taken, offreemen and slaves, not less than eight thousand. Butwhat gave the Romans the greatest joy on the com­mencement of their operations was, the arrival ofMasinissa, who came, according to some, with no morethan two hundred horsemen; but most authors saywith two thousand. Now, as he was by far the great­est of all the kings of that age, and performed the mostimportant services to the Roman state, it appears worthwhile to digress a little, in order to relate the greatvicissitudes of fortune which he experienced in theloss and recovery of his father's kingdom.

supplication for four days was decreed. Publius jEliiis,pretor, when the senate broke up, called an assemblyof the people, and ascended the rostrum with CaiusLaslius. There, on hearing thatthe Carthaginian armiesbad been routed; so renowned a monarch as Syphaxvanquished and made prisoner; and conquest ex­tended, with extraordinary success, over every part ofNumidia, the people could not contain their joy, butby shouts and other methods usually practised by themultitude, expressed immoderate transports. Thepretor therefore immediately issued orders, that thekeepers should open the temples in every part of thecity; and that all should be allowed, during the wholeday, to go round them, and pay their worship andthanks to the gods. On the day following, he intro­duced Masinissa's ambassadors, who first congratu­lated the senate on the success of Publius Scipio inAfrica: then gave thanks for his having ' not only ho­nored Masinissa with the title of king, but made himone, by reinstating him on the throne of his father;where (now that Syphax was removed) he bad, if it sopleased the senate, a prospect of reigning without con­test or apprehension; they likewise made their ac-knowlegements for praises he had bestowed on him inthe assembly, and for the very magnificent presentswith which he had loaded him.' They added, ' thatMasinissa had exerted his best endeavors to appearnot unworthy of those favors, and would continue soto do. They then requested the senate to confirm bytheir decree the title of king, and the other distin­guished marks conferred on him by Scipio; tellingthem that their monarch farther intreated, that, if itso pleased them, the Numidian prisoners then at Romemight be sent home,—a circumstance which would dohim high honor among his countrymen.' The senatemade answer, ' that congratulations on the successes ofAfrica ought in the confederates to be mutual; thatScipio appeared to have acted properly and regularly,in giving to their Numidian ally the title of king; andthat whatever else he should do grateful to Masinissa,

you received from Spain. These hopes are suggestedto me by the fortune of the Roman people, the godswho witnessed the treaty which the enemy have vio­lated, and the friendship of the kings, Syphax andMasinissa, to whom I shall look for aid while securingmyself against perfidy. The war will disclose manythings which do not appear now; and it is the businessof a general not to fail of improving the overtures offortune, and to convert casual occurrences to the ac­complishment of his designs. I shall, Quintus Fabius,have the antagonist whom you assign me, Hannibal:I shall compel him to fight in his own country, andCarthage rather shall be the prize than the half-ruinedforts of the Bruttians. With respect to the securityof the state, and that it should suffer no injury whileI am on my passage; while I am landing my army inAfrica; while I am marching forwards to Carthage;be careful in any assertion as to what you, QuintusFabius, were able to accomplish, at a time when Han­nibal was pursuing a rapid career of victory throughall parts of Italy; be mindful, I say, lest it be consi­dered as an insult, that you do not too freely affirm ofhim, that, shaken and almost broken in pieces, hisoverthrow by Publius Licinius the consul were easy,—a man, by the way, of the most consummate valor, andwho declined the lot of so distant a province as Africa,only because, being chief pontiff, he must not be ab­sent from his religious duties. In fact, even thoughthe war were not to be brought to a speedier conclu­sion by the method which I propose, still it wouldconcern the dignity of the Roman people, and theirreputation among foreign kings and nations, that weshould appear to have spirit, not only to defend Italy,but to carry our arms into Africa; and that it shouldnot be spread abroad, and believed, that no Romangeneral dared what Hannibal had dared; and that, inthe former Punic war, when the contest was aboutSicily, Africa had been often attacked by our fleetsand armies; but that now, when the contest is aboutItaly, Africa should enjoy peace.

turn for great services performed by kings towardsthem: that the Roman ambassadors would soon be inAfrica, to whom the senate would give instructions toregulate conditions of peace with Vermina, as he shouldsubmit the terms intirely to the will of the Romanpeople; and that, if he wished that any thing shouldbe added, left out, or altered, he must make a secondapplication to the senate.' The ambassadors sent toAfrica on those affairs were Caius Terentius Varro,Publius Lucretius, and Cneius Octavius, each of whomhad a quinquereme assigned him.
12. A letter was then read in the senate from Quin-tus Minucius, the pretor, who held the province ofBruttium, that 'the money had been privately carriedoff by night out of the treasury of Proserpine at Locri;and that there were no traces which could direct tothe discovery of the guilty persons.' The senate washighly incensed at finding that the practice of sacrilegecontinued, and that even the fate of Pleminius, anexample so recent and so conspicuous both of the guiltand of the punishment, did not deter from it. Theyordered the consul, Cneius Aurelius, to signify to thepretor in Bruttium, that 'it was the pleasure of thesenate that an inquiry be made concerning the robberyof the treasury, according to the method used by Mar­cus Pomponius, pretor, three years before; that themoney which could be discovered should be restored,and any deficiency be made up ; and that, if he thoughtproper, atonements should be made for the purpose ofexpiating the violation of the temple, in the mannerformerly prescribed by the pontiffs.' At the same timealso, accounts were brought of many prodigies happen­ing in several places. It was said, that in Lucania thesky had been seen in a blaze; that at Privernum, inclear weather, the sun had been of a red color duringa whole day; that at Lanuvium, in the temple of JunoSospita, a very loud bustling noise had been heard inthe night.

ceedings, kept Etruria in obedience; though it wasalmost intirely devoted to Mago, and to the hope ofobtaining, by his means, a change of government. Theinquisitions, directed by the senate, he executed withthe utmost impartiality; and many of the Tuscan no­bles, who had either gone themselves, or sent deputiesto Mago, about the revolt of their states, stood trial,and were found guilty. Others, from a consciousnessof guilt, went into voluntary exile; and by thus with­drawing, though condemned in their absence, couldsuffer only in a confiscation of their effects.
37. While the consuls were thus employed in diffe­rent parts, the censors at Rome (Marcus Livius andCains Claudius) called over the list of the senate.Quintus Fabius Maximus was again chosen principal;seven were disgraced; not one, however, of those whohad sat in the curule chair. The orders for repairingpublic buildings were enforced with the greatest strict­ness. A road was contracted for, to be made from theox market to the temple of Venus, with public seats;and a temple to be built for the Great Mother on thePalatine hill. A new tax, from the sale of salt, wasestablished. This article had been sold at the sixthpart of an ass, both at Rome and in all parts of Italy;and it was now directed to be supplied at the same rateat Rome, at a higher in the country towns and mar­kets, and at various prices in different places. Peoplewere firmly persuaded that Livius had contrived thistax in resentment, and on account of a sentence hav­ing been formerly passed on him, which he had consi­dered as unjust; and that, in fixing the price of salt,the greatest burden had been laid on those tribes bywhose influence he had been condemned: hence thesurname of Salinator was given to him. The lustrumwas closed later than usual; because the censors sentpersons through all the provinces to bring them a re­turn of the number of Roman citizens in each of thearmies. Including these, there were rated in the sur­vey two hundred and fourteen thousand men. CaiusClaudius Nero had the honor of closing the lustrum.

13. When Scipio received the account of the armybeing assembled, he saw plainly that, with the Romanlegions alone, he could not oppose so great a multitude;nor without using the auxiliary troops of the barba­rians, at least for the purpose of making a show ofstrength; but that, at the same time, it was highlyimproper that they should compose such a proportionof his force as might enable them, by changing sides,to produce consequences of importance—an event whichhad caused the destruction of his father and uncle.Sending forward therefore Silanus to Colca, who wassovereign of twenty-eight towns, to receive from himthe horse and foot which he had engaged to raise duringthe winter, he set out himself from Tarraco, and, col­lecting small bodies of auxiliaries from the allies wholay near his road, proceeded to Castulo. Hither Sila­nus brought three thousand auxiliary foot and fivehundred horse. From thence he advanced to the cityof Bascula, his army amounting, in the whole, of hiscountrymen and allies, horse and foot, to forty-fivethousand. While they were forming their camp Magoand Masinissa, with the whole of their cavalry, madean attack on them, and would have dispersed the work­men, had not some horsemen whom Scipio had con­cealed behind a hill, conveniently situated for the pur­pose, suddenly rushed out as they advanced to thecharge. These, at the first onset, routed all who hadpushed on foremost against the men employed in thefortification. The contest with the rest, who advancedon their march drawn up in regular order, was longer,and for some time doubtful. But the light cohortsfrom the outposts, the soldiers called off from theworks, and afterwards greater numbers, who were or­dered to take arms, came up fresh, and engaged thewearied enemy.

those of their friends. Two of their commanders, Nicoand Democrates, fell fighting courageously. Philo-menus, who had been the author of the plot for be­traying the city to Hannibal, rode away from the fightat full speed; his horse was not long after seen stray­ing through the city without a rider, but his body wasnever found, and the general opinion was that he fellfrom his horse into an open well. Carthalo, as he wascoming to the consul unarmed, to remind him of theirfathers being connected by- ah intercourse of hospi­tality, was slain by a soldier who met him in the way.The rest were put to the sword without distinction,armed and unarmed, Carthaginians and Tarentinesalike. Many even of the Bruttians were killed, eitherthrough mistake, or through the inveterate hatredborne towards them by the Romans, or with design todiscountenance the report of the place being betrayed,and that it might rather appear to have been taken byforce of arms. After this carnage, the victors pro­ceeded in several parties to plunder the city. We aretold that there were here thirty thousand persons in astate of servitude, a vast quantity of silver wroughtand coined, eighty-seven thousand pounds weight ofgold, together with statues and pictures in such num­bers, as almost to rival the decorations of Syracuse.But Fabius, with more greatness of mind than wasshown by Marcellus, refrained from meddling withbooty of that sort; and when his secretary asked himwhat he would have done with the statues of theirgods, which were of gigantic size, and habited likewarriors, he ordered him to 'let the Tarentines keeptheir angry gods to themselves.' Then the wall, whichseparated the citadel from the town, was demolishedand rased. Amid these transactions Hannibal, havingmade prisoners the party employed in the siege ofCaulon, who capitulated, hearing of the siege of Ta-retitum, marched night and day with all expedition torelieve it: but while he was hastening thither, he re­ceived the news of its being taken.

letters of Valerius and Aurelius were read, and audi­ence given to the ambassadors of the Athenians. Afterwhich a decree of the senate was passed, that thanksshould be given to their allies, because, though longsolicited, they had not been prevailed on, even by'dread of a siege, to depart from their engagements.With regard to sending assistance to them, they re­solved that an answer should be given as soon as theconsuls should have cast lots for the provinces, andwhen the consul to whose lot Macedonia fell shouldhave proposed to the people to declare war againstPhilip, king of the Macedonians.
6. The province of Macedonia fell by lot to PubliusSulpicius; and he proposed to the people to declare,'that they chose and ordered, that on account of theinjuries and hostilities committed against the allies ofthe Roman people, war should be proclaimed againstking Philip and the Macedonians under his govern­ment.' The province of Italy fell to the lot of theother consul, Aurelius. The pretors then cast lots:to Cneius Sergius Plancus fell the city jurisdiction;to Quintus Fulvius Gillo, Sicily; to Quintus MinuciusRufus, Bruttium; and to Lucius Furius Purpureo.Gaul. At the first meeting of the people the proposalconcerning the Macedonian war was rejected by al­most all the tribes. This was occasioned partly by thepeople's own inclinations, who, wearied by the lengthand severity of the late war, longed to be freed fromtoils and dangers; and partly by Quintus B;ebius, tri­bune of the people, who, pursuing the old practice ofcriminating the patricians, charged them with multi­plying wars one after another, so that the people couldnever enjoy peace. This proceeding gave great offenceto the patricians, and the tribune was severely repre­hended in the senate, where all earnestly recommendedit to the consul to call a new assembly for passing theproposal; to rebuke the backwardness of the people;and to prove to them how highly detrimental and dis­honorable it would be to decline engaging in that war.

The whole day would not be sufficient, were I to re­count to you all the kings and generals who, by pass­ing rashly into an enemy's country, have brought thegreatest calamities on themselves and their armies.The Athenians, for instance, a state remarkable forprudence, having, at the instigation of a youth whowas distinguished as much by his active spirit as byhis nobility, neglected a war at home, and sent overa large fleet to Sicily (their commonwealth at thattime in a most florishing condition), suffered, in onenaval engagement, such a blow as could never be re­trieved.

For in what circumstance can theybe compared? After sailing along the coasts of Italyand Gaul, where there was nothing to oppose you, youcarried your fleet into the harbor of Emporiae, a citybelonging to our allies; and, having landed yourmen, you led them through countries intirely freefrom danger to Tarraco, to the friends and allies of theRoman people.

The siegeof New Carthage you carried on quite at your leisure,while neither of the three Carthaginian armies attemptedto relieve the place.

The senate then received a survey of twelve colonies,presented by the censors of those colonies, which hadnever been done before, in order that records mightappear in the public archives of their proportion ofstrength both in men and money. The review of theknights then began; and it so happened that both thecensors had a horse at the public expense. Whenthey came to the Pollian tribe, in which was inrolledthe name of Marcus Livius, and whom the herald hesi­tated to cite, Nero called to him, 'Cite Marcus Li­vius;' and being actuated either by some remains oftheir old enmity, or by an unseasonable affectation ofstrictness, he ordered Livius to sell his horse, becausehe had been condemned by a sentence of the people.In like manner Marcus Livius, when they came to theNarnian tribe, in which the name of his colleague ap­peared, he ordered him to dispose of his horse, fortwo reasons: one, that he had given false evidence;the other, that he had not been sincere in his recon­ciliation with him. Thus they became engaged in ascandalous contest, each aspersing the character of theother, though at the same time he injured his own.On going out of their office of censor, when CaiusClaudius had taken the oath respecting the observanceof the laws, and had gone up to the treasury, amongthe names of those whom he left disfranchised in thetreasury list, he gave in the name of his associate.Marcus Livius also came thither, and except the Me-tian tribe, which had neither concurred in his con­demnation, nor in appointing him consul or censor,he left the whole Roman people, thirty-four tribes, dis­franchised in the treasury list; and this, he said, hedid, because they had not only condemned him wheninnocent, but had elected him, while under the saidsentence, both consul and censor; so that they couldnot deny that they had been guilty, either of one greatfault in giving their sentence, or of two in the elec­tions.

should any occasion offer, would even assist the Ro­mans. The Insubrians knew not that such an agree­ment had been concluded, but they harbored in theirminds some kind of suspicion that the fidelity of theirconfederates was wavering. Wherefore, in formingtheir troops for battle, not daring to intrust eitherwing to them, lest, if they should treacherously giveground, they might cause a total defeat, they placedthem in reserve behind the line. At the beginning ofthe fight the consul vowed a temple to Juno Sospita,provided the enemy should on that day be routed,and driven from the field; on which the soldiersraised a shout, declaring, that they would insure totheir commander the completion of his vow, and atthe same time attacked the enemy. The Insubriansdid not stand even the first onset. Some writers affirmthat the Casnomanians, falling on their rear, during theheat of the engagement, caused as much disorderthere as prevailed in their front; and that, thusassailed on both sides, thirty-five thousand of themivere slain, five thousand seven hundred taken pri­soners, among whom was Hamilcar, a Carthaginiangeneral, the original cause of the war; and that a hun­dred and thirty military standards, and above two hun­dred waggons were taken. On this, the towns, whichhad joined in the revolt, surrendered to the Romans.
31. The other consul, Minucius, had at first spreadhis troops through the territories of the Boians, com­mitting violent depredations every where; but after­wards, when that people left the Insubrians, and camehome to defend their own property, he kept his menwithin their camp, expecting to come to an engage­ment with the enemy. Nor would the Boians havedeclined a battle if their spirits had not been de­pressed, by hearing of the defeat of the Insubrians.This so deeply affected them, that, deserting theircommander and their camp, they dispersed themselvesthrough the several towns, each wishing to take careof his own effects.

very seasonable in another respect, as it gave him theassistance of their counsel, respecting the measures tobe taken for the farther prosecution of the war. Onthis occasion, when they compared accounts of the dis­positions of the Spaniards in each of their several pro­vinces, Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, alone, made a favor­able report; giving his opinion, that the remote trackof Spain, which lies on the ocean and about Gades,was, as yet, unacquainted with the Romans, and there­fore sufficiently well affected to the Carthaginians. Theother Hasdrubal and Mago agreed in pronouncing that'the affections of all, both in their public and privatecapacities, were attached to Scipio by the kind treat­ment which he gave them; and that there would be noend of desertions, until all the Spanish soldiers wereeither removed into the remotest parts of Spain, or car­ried away into Gaul. Therefore, though the Carthagi­nian senate had passed no order for the purpose, yetit was necessary that Hasdrubal should go into Italy,where the principal stress of the war lay, and where thefinal decision of it must be expected; in order, at thesame time, to carry away all the Spanish soldiers outof Spain, and out of the way of hearing the name ofScipio: that the Carthaginian army, being greatly re­duced, as well by desertions as by the late unfortunatebattle, should be filled up with Spanish recruits: thatMago, giving up his forces to Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo,should go over in person to the Balearic islands, witha large sum of money, to hire auxiliaries: that Has­drubal, son of Gisgo, should, with the remainder, re­tire into Lusitania, and by no means come to an en­gagement with the Romans: that out of all their ef­fective horsemen a body of three thousand cavalryshould be made up for Masinissa, to make excursionsthrough what they called Hither Spain, succor theirallies, and carry depredations through the towns andlands of the enemy.' Having determined on thesemeasures, the commanders separated, to put their re­solves in execution. Such were the transactions ofthis year in Spain. At Rome, the reputation of Scipio

Africa; and with respect to the lands for his soldiers,it was decreed that whatever number of years each ofthem had served in Spain or in Africa, he should forevery year receive two acres; and that ten commis­sioners should make the distribution. Three commis­sioners were then appointed to fill up the number ofcolonists at Venusia, because the strength of that co­lony had been reduced in the war with Hannibal:Caius Terrentius Varro, Titus Quintius Flamininus,Publius Cornelius, son of Cneius Scipio, were thecommissioners who inrolled the colonists for Ve­nusia. During the same year, Caius Cornelius Ce-thegus, who in the quality of proconsul commandedin Spain, routed a numerous army of the enemy in theterritory of Sedeta; in which battle it is said thatfifteen thousand Spaniards were slain, and seventy-eight military standards taken. The consul Caius Au-relius, on returning from his province to Rome, tohold the elections, made heavy complaints, not on thesubject on which they had supposed he would, that thesenate had not waited for his coming, nor allowed himan opportunity of arguing the matter with the pretor;but, that ' the senate had decreed a triumph in such amanner, without hearing the report of any one of thosewho were present at-the operations of the war, exceptthe person who was to enjoy the triumph: that theirancestors had made it a rule that the lieutenants-gene­ral, the military tribunes, the centurions, and eventhe soldiers, should be present at the same; for thisreason, that the reality of his exploits, to whom sohigh an honor was paid, might be publicly ascertained.Now, of that army which fought with the Gauls, hadany one soldier, or even a soldier's servant, been pre­sent, of whom the senate could inquire concerning thetruth or falsehood of the pretor's narrative?

persuaded by their guides that there was another anda shorter road to the river Bastis, and where, it wassaid, they might attack them in their passage. Has-drubal finding the ford in possession of the enemy,changed his course, directing it towards the ocean ; hisarmy now retreating with precipitancy, so that the Ro­man legions were left at some distance behind. How­ever, the horse and the light infantry harassed and de­layed them, by attacking sometimes their rear, some­times their flanks; and as they were obliged to haltfrequently, on occasion of these interruptions, and tosupport the attacks, at one time of the horse, at anotherof the infantry and auxiliary foot, they were overtakenby the legions. The consequence was, not a fight, buta carnage as of cattle; until at length the general him­self, setting the example of a flight, made his escapeto the adjacent hills with about six thousand men halfarmed: the rest were either slain or taken prisoners.The Carthaginians hastily fortified an irregular campon the highest part of the ground, and defended them­selves there without difficulty, the enemy in vain at­tempting to climb so difficult an ascent. But a block­ade, in a place naked and destitute, was hardly to besupported, even for a few days: desertions to the Ro­man, therefore, were frequent. Hasdrubal having atlength procured some ships, and the sea being not fardistant, left his army in the night, and fled to Gades.When Scipio was informed of the flight of the general,leaving ten thousand foot and one thousand horse withSilanus for the blockade of the camp, he returned him­self with the rest of the forces to Tarraco, where hearrived after a march of seventy days; during whichhe was employed in examining into the conduct of thepetty princes and states, in order that their rewardsmight be proportioned according to a just estimate oftheir merits.

to put an end to the war, none of the other parties, intact, showing any disposition towards it: that Syphaxmust entertain no hopes of entering into any treatywith the Romans, unless he renounced the party of theCarthaginians.' Thus he dissolved the truce, in plans.Launching his ships, (for it was now the beginning ofspring,) he put on board engines and machines, as ifan attack on Utica were intended by sea; at the sametime sending two thousand men to take possession ofthe hill which commanded that place, and which hehad formerly occupied, with a view, at once to divertthe attention of the enemy from his real design, and toprevent any sally being made from the city, while heshould be employed at a distance against Syphax andHasdrubal. He likewise feared an attack should biscamp be left with only a small force to defend it.
5. Having taken these preparatory steps, he sum­moned a council, ordering the spies to give an accountof the discoveries which they had made; at the sametime requesting Masinissa, who was as well acquaintedwith every circumstance of the enemy, to deliver hisopinion ; and, lastly, he informed them of a plan whichhe intended to execute on the following night. Hegave orders to the tribunes that, as soon as the trum­pets had sounded on the breaking up of the meeting atthe pretorium, they should march the legions out ofthe camp. In pursuance of these orders the troopsbegan to move a little before sunset: about the firstwatch they formed their line of march; and aboutmidnight, (for the way was seven miles,) proceeding ina moderate pace, they arrived at the enemy's camp.He there gave Laelius the command of a part of theforces, to whom were joined Masinissa and the Numi-dians, with orders to fall on the camp of Syphax, andset it on fire. Then, taking Laelius and Masinissaapart, he intreated each separately, that 'as the nightwould be apt to impede the best concerted measures,they should make up for the difficulties by their dili­gence and care;' telling them also, that ' he meant toattack Hasdrubat and the Carthaginian camp, but would

We are told that Scipiooften said afterwards, that the ambition, first of Tibe­rius Claudius, and then of Cneius Cornelius, was whatprevented that war from ending in the utter destruc­tion of Carthage. The Carthaginians having been ex­hausted by the long continuance of the late struggles,found it difficult to raise the first contribution money,so that the senate-house was filled with grief and la­mentations; on which occasion, it is said, that Hanni­bal was observed to laugh; and that being reprovedby Hasdrubal Haedus, for laughing in a moment ofpublic sorrowing, and when he himself was the causeof their tears, he said: 'If the inward thoughts couldbe perceived in the same manner as the look of thecountenance is perceived by the eye, you would beimmediately convinced that the laughter which youblame proceeds not from a heart elated with joy, butfrom one driven almost to madness by misfortunes;and yet it is not, by any means, so unseasonable asthose absurd and inconsistent tears of yours.

a decided victory to Syphax; nor was there even roomfor the enemy to escape, inclosed as they were on bothsides: the rest, therefore, horse and foot, were eitherslain or taken. Masinissa collected round himself, inclose order, about two hundred horsemen, whom hedivided into three squadrons, with orders to breakthrough the enemy, having appointed a place wherethey should reassemble, after being separated in theirflight. He himself made his way through the midstof their weapons, as he had proposed; the other twosquadrons failed in the attempt; one surrenderingthrough fear, the other, after a more obstinate resist­ance, being overwhelmed with darts, and cut to pieces.Vermina followed close on the steps of Masinissa, whobaffled him by frequently turning out of one road intoanother; and whom he at length obliged, harassed withextreme fatigue, to desist from the pursuit, and ar­rived himself with sixty horsemen at the lesser Syrtis.There, with the honorable consciousness of havingoften attempted the recovery of his father's kingdom,lie rested until the coming of Caius Laelius and theRoman fleet to Africa, between the Carthaginian Em­poria and the nation of the Garamantians. From thesecircumstances, I am inclined to believe that Masinissacame afterwards to Scipio, rather with a small bodyof forces than a large one: for the very great number,which has been mentioned by some, suits the conditionof a king on a throne; the smaller that of an exile.

The sea, from being prettywide at each side, is here contracted into a strait sovery narrow, that at first view the whole appears liketwo harbors facing the two entrances of the Euripus.A more dangerous station for a fleet can hardly befound ; for besides that the winds rush down suddenly,and with great fury, from the high mountains on eachside, the strait itself of the Euripus does not ebb andflow seven times a day at stated hours, as report says;but the current, changing irregularly, like the wind,from one point to another, is hurried along like a tor­rent tumbling from a steep mountain; so that, night orday, ships can never lie quiet. But, besides the pe­rilous situation iu which his fleet lay, he found thatthe town was firm and impregnable; surrounded onone side by the sea, extremely well fortified by landon the other; secured by a strong garrison, and, aboveall, by the fidelity of the commanders and principalinhabitants; which character those at Oreum had notsupported with honor or steadiness. The Roman, ina business rashly undertaken, acted so far prudently,that, when he had seen all the difficulties attending it,not to waste time, he quickly desisted from the at­tempt, removing with his fleet from thence to Cynus inLocris, the landing-place for the city of Opus, whichlies at the distance of a mile from the sea.
7. Philip had received notice from Oreum by thesignal fires; but, through the treachery of Plator, itwas too late when they were raised on the beacons,and as he was not a match for the enemy at sea, it wasdifficult for him to approach the island; he hesitated,therefore, and took no part in that business. To therelief of Chalcis he flew with alacrity, as soon as heperceived the signal: for though Chalcis stands onthe same island, yet the strait which separates it fromthe continent is so narrow, that there is a communi­cation between them by a bridge, and the approach toit is easier by land than by water. Philip, therefore,

the very entrance of the gate, so that the men wereobliged to make their way over the trench and ram­part. Here the slaughter of the enemy was the great­est. There were killed no less than eight thousandmen, and five elephants. Nor did the Romans gainthe victory without loss of blood: of the two legions,about one thousand seven hundred were killed, and ofthe allies above one thousand three hundred. Greatnumbers, both of Romans and allies, were wounded.In the following night Hannibal decamped, and thoughMarcellus wished to pursue him, he was prevented byhis wounded, which were in great number. Scouts,who were sent to observe his march, brought intelli­gence next day that Hannibal had taken the road to­wards Bruttium.
15. About the same time the Hirpinians, Lucanians,and Volscians, surrendered themselves to the consulQuintus Fulvius, delivering up Hannibal's garrisonswhich they had in their cities, and were mildly re­ceived by the consul with only a verbal reproof fortheir past errors. Hopes of similar gentle treatmentwere held out to the Bruttians also, through two bro­thers, Vibius and Pactius, of the most illustrious fa­mily of any in that nation, who came to request thesame terms of capitulation which were granted to theLucanians. The other consul, Quintus Fabius, tookby assault Manduria, a town in the territory of Sal-lentum. Here he made four thousand prisoners, andgained much booty of other kinds. Proceeding thenceto Tarentum, he pitched his camp at the very mouth ofthe harbor. Of the ships, which Livius had kept herefor the purpose of protecting convoys, he loaded partwith machines and implements fit for assailing walls;the rest he furnished with engines, stones, and missileweapons of every kind; the storeships also, not con­fining himself to such only as were moved by oars, befitted out in the same manner, in order that some mightbring out the machines and ladders to the walls, whilethe others, from their ships at some distance, shouldannoy with missile weapons the men employed in de-

plete victory. After taking eighteen ships, and dis­persing the rest, he returned to Lilybaeum with abun­dance of booty, acquired both on land and sea.
30. Philip, during this summer, brought assistanceto the Achieans, in compliance with their earnest jn-treaties; for, on one side, Machanidas, tyrant of theLacedasmonians, harassed them continually by irrup­tions from his territories, which lay contiguous totheirs; and on another the jEtolians, transporting anarmy in ships through the strait which runs betweenNaupactus and Patrae, called by the neighboring inha­bitants Rhios, had spread devastations through thecountry. A report also prevailed that Attalus, kingof Asia, intended to come over into Europe, becausethe jEtolians, in their last general council, had consti­tuted him chief magistrate of their state. While Phi­lip was, for all these reasons, marching down intoGreece, he was met at the city of Lamia by the JEto-lians, under the command of Pyrrhias, who had beencreated pretor for that year, conjointly with Attalus,on account of the latter's absence. Besides their ownforces they had a body of auxiliaries sent by Attalus,and about one thousand men from the Roman fleet ofPublius Sulpicius. Against this commander, and theseforces, Philip fought twice with success; and, in eachbattle, slew at least one thousand. The jEtolians be­ing so greatly dismayed as to keep themselves closeunder the walls of Lamia, Philip led back his army toPbalara. This place, being situated on the Malianbay, was formerly thickly inhabited, on account of itsexcellent harbor, the safe anchorage on either side,with other commodious circumstances, to which boththe sea and the land contributed. Hither came am­bassadors from Ptolemy, king of Egypt, the RhodianS,Athenians, and Chians, with intent to compose the dif­ferences between Philip and the jEtolians. The jEto-lians also invited a mediator from among their neigh­bors, Amynander, king of Athamania. But the con­cern of all was engaged, not so much by their regardfor the ^Etolians, who were remarkable for an arro-

should keep it himself. Accordingly, he wrote to Phi-locles, who had the command in Corinth and Argos,to have a meeting with the tyrant. Philocles, besidescoming with a valuable present, added to that pledgeOf future friendship between the king and the tyrant,that it was Philip's wish to unite his daughters inmarriage to the sons of Nabis. The tyrant at firstrefused to receive the city on any other terms thanthat of being invited by a decree of the Argives them­selves: but afterwards, hearing that in a full assemblythey had treated his name not only with scorn, buteven with abhorrence, he thought he had now a suffi­cient excuse for plundering them, and he accordinglydesired Philip to give him possession of the place.Nabis was admitted into the city in the night, withoutthe privity of any of the inhabitants, and, at the firstlight, seized on the higher parts of it, and shut thegates. A few of the principal people having madetheir escape during the first confusion, the propertiesof all who were absent were seized as booty: thosewho were present were stripped of their gold andsilver, and loaded with exorbitant contributions. Suchas paid these readily were discharged without personalinsult and laceration of their bodies; but such as weresuspected of hiding or reserving any of their effects,were mangled and tortured like slaves. He then sum­moned an assembly, in which he proposed the passingof two laws; one for an abolition of debts, the otherfor a distribution of the land, in shares, to each man—two firebrands in the hands of the enemies of govern­ment, for inflaming the populace against the higherranks.
39. The tyrant, when he had the city of Argos in hispower, never considering from whom, or on what con­ditions, he had received it, sent ambassadors to Elatia,to Quintius, and to Attalus, in his winter quarters atjEgina, to tell them that ' he was in possession ofArgos; and that if Quintius would come hither andconsult with him, he had no doubt but that every thingliv. vol. v. 2 c

was inflamed with a strong desire of obtaining the pro­vince of Africa; having in view either an easy con­quest, or, if it were now to be concluded, the glory ofterminating so great a war in his consulate. He de­clared, therefore, that he would not suffer any busi­ness to be done until Africa were decreed to him; forhis colleague declined putting in his claim for it, beinga moderate, prudent man, who perceived that a contestwith Scipio for that honor, besides being unjust, wouldbe also unequal. Quintus Minucius Thermus andMauius Acilius Glabrio, tribunes of the people, saidthat 'Cneius Cornelius was endeavoring to carry apoint which had been attempted in vain, the year be­fore, by the consul Tiberius Claudius: that, by thedirection of the senate, the question had been proposedto the people respecting the command in Africa, andthat the thirty-five tribes unanimously decreed thatcommand to Publius Scipio.' The affair, after beingcanvassed with much heat both in the senate andin the assembly of the people, was at last broughtto this conclusion,—that it should be left to the de­termination of the former. The fathers, therefore,on oath, for so it had been agreed, voted that theconsuls should settle between themselves, or cast lotsfor their provinces, which of them should have Italy,and which a fleet of fifty ships. That he to whose lotit fell to command the ffeet should sail to Sicily; andif peace could not be concluded with the Carthagi­nians, should pass over from thence to Africa, wherehe the said consul should command at sea, and Scipioon land, with the same extent of authority as hereto­fore. If the terms of peace should be agitated, thatthen the tribunes should take the opinion of the peo­ple, whether they would order the consul or PubliusScipio to settle those terms, and if the victorious armywas to be conducted home, whom they would order todo it. If they should order the peace to be grantedby Publius Scipio, and the army also to be broughthome by him, that then the consul should not crossover from Sicily to Africa.

9. Pleminius was governor in chief; that part of thesoldiers which he had brought with him from Rhe-gium was under his own immediate command: therest under military tribunes. These tribunes, Ser-gius and Matienus, happened to meet one of Plemi­nius' soldiers running away with a silver cup, whichhe had taken by force out of the house of a citizen, theowners pursuing him: on the cup being taken fromhim by order of the tribunes, at first ill language wasused, then ensued clamor; and at length a scufflebetween the soldiers of Pleminius and those of the tri­bunes. The disturbance increasing, as any happenedto come up to assist their party, Pleminius' men, be­ing worsted, ran to him in crowds, showing their bloodand wounds, with violent outcries and expressions ofresentment, and recounting the reproaches that hadbeen thrown on himself; which so inflamed him, thatrushing out of his house, and calling the tribunes be­fore him, he ordered them to be stripped, and the rodsto be prepared. As some time was spent'in strippingthem, (for they made resistance, and implored aid,)on a sudden their own soldiers, rendered bold by theirlate success, ran together from all parts, as if they hadbeen called to arms against an enemy. On seeing thepersons of the tribunes already injured by the rods,they were suddenly seized with such ungovernablerage, that without regard either to his dignity, or even

effects as they were able to carry; the rest became theprey of the soldiers; nor was there any kind of crueltywhich they could have suffered from an enemy thatthey did not suffer from these their confederates. Theinfliction of such hardships was irksome to Philip,even while he authorised it; but as the country wassoon to become the property of the foe, he wished torescue out of it their persons at least. In this mannerwere ravaged the towns of Phacium, Iresia, Euhy-drium, Eretria, and Palasphatus. On his coming toPherae the gates were shut against him, and as itwould necessarily occasion a considerable delay, if heattempted to take it by force, and as he could notspare time, he dropped the design, and crossed overthe mountains into Macedonia; for he had receivedintelligence that the JEtolians too were marching to­wards him. These, on hearing of the battle fought onthe banks of the river Aous, first laid waste the near­est tracts round Sperchia, and Long Come, as it iscalled, and then, passing over into Thessaly, got pos­session of Cymine and Angea at the first assault.From Metropolis they were repulsed by the inha­bitants, who, while a part of their army was plunder­ing the country, assembled in a body to defend thecity. Afterwards, making an attempt on Callithere,they were attacked by the townsmen in a like manner;but withstood their onset with more steadiness, droveback into the town the party which had sallied, andcontent with that success, as they had scarcely anyprospect of taking the place by storm, retired. Theythen took by assault and sacked the towns of Theumaand Calathas. Achorrae they gained by surrender.Xynias, through similar apprehensions, was abandonedby the inhabitants. These having forsaken theirhomes, and going together in a body, fell in with aparty of Athamanians employed in protecting theirforagers; all of whom, an irregular and unarmed mul­titude, incapable of any resistance, were put to thesword by the troops.

tion. One hundred and seventy Campanians, at thehead of whom were two brothers of the name of Blo-sius, had conspired to set fire to all these at one hourof the night. But the design was discovered by someslaves belonging to the Blosii; whereon, the gates be­ing instantly shut by order of the proconsul, and thesoldiers having, on the signal being given, assembledunder arms, all who were concerned in the conspiracywere seized, and after undergoing a severe examina­tion by torture, condemned and put to death. Theinformers were rewarded with their freedom, and tenthousand asses' each. The Nucerians and Acerrans,having complained that they had no place of habita­tion, as Acerra was partly burned, and Nuceria demo­lished, Fulvius sent them to Rome to the senate.Permission was granted to the Acerrans to rebuildwhat had been thus destroyed; and the Nucerians,agreeably to their own choice, were transplanted toAtella, the inhabitants of the latter being ordered toremove to Calatia. Among the multiplicity of im­portant affairs, (some prosperous, others adverse,)which occupied the thoughts of the public, even thecitadel of Tarentum was not forgotten: Marcus Ogul-uius and Publius Aquilius being commissioned for thepurpose, went into Etruria to purchase corn, whichwas to be conveyed to Tarentum; and, together withthe corn, were sent thither, as a reinforcement to thegarrison, one thousand men out of the city troops,consisting of equal numbers of Romans and allies.
4. The summer was now nearly elapsed, and thetime of the consular election drew nigh: but a letterreceived from Marcellus, affirming that it would be in­jurious to the public interest, if he were to depart astep from Hannibal, who was retreating before him,while he, by a close pursuit, distressed him materially,threw the senate into some perplexity, as they wereunwilling either to call home the consul, at a timewhen he was most actively employed against the ene-

fore lightly equipped for expedition, he hastened toHerdonea by such long marches, that he almost anti­cipated the report of his approach; and, to strike thegreater terror, he advanced in order of battle. TheRoman commander, fully equal to him in boldness,but inferior in judgment and strength, hastily led outhis forces, and engaged him. The fifth legion, andthe left wing of allied infantry, commenced the fightwith vigor. But Hannibal gave directions to his ca­valry that, as soon as the lines of infantry should havetheir thoughts and eyes intirely occupied on the con­test between themselves, they should ride round; thatone half of them should fall on the enemy's camp, andthe other on the rear of their troops that were engaged.With a sneer on the name of Fulvins, he assured themthat, as he had utterly defeated him in the same coun­try two years before, the present battle would have asimilar issue. Nor was this expectation ill-grounded:for, after many of the Romans had fallen, in the closeconflict between the lines of infantry, (the companiesand battalions nevertheless still maintaining theirground,) the tumult raised by the cavalry in the rear,and the enemy's shout from the camp, which washeard at the same time, put to flight the sixth legion,which, being posted in the second line, was throwninto disorder by the Numidians; as were afterwardsthe fifth, and those in the van. Some fled in hurryand confusion, the rest were surrounded and slain;among whom fell Cneius Fulvius himself, with elevenmilitary tribunes. How many thousands of the Ro­mans and allies were slain in that battle, who can posi­tively affirm, when I find in some historians thirteenthousand, in others not more than seven? The con­queror possessed himself of the camp and the spoil.Having discovered that Herdonea was disposed to re­volt to the Romans, and would not continue faithful tohim after his departure, he removed the inhabitants toMetapontum and Thurium, and burned the city to theground.

time, and saw that no motion was made by the enemy,they attacked the transports. The affair bore no re­semblance to a naval engagement; it was more like anattack made by ships against walls. The transportsbad some advantage in their height; for the Cartha­ginians, being obliged to throw their weapons upward,discharged most of them to no purpose against thehigher places; whereas those from the transports fellwith greater force, at the same time gaining additionalpower from their own weight. The scouts and lighterRoman vessels, which pushed out through the open­ings under the bridges of communication between theirships, were at first run down by the weight and bulkof the Carthaginian ships of war; and afterwards theybecame an obstruction to those who defended the line,because, as they were mixed among the enemy's ships,they often obliged them to stop the discharge of theirweapons, lest, missing their aim, they should hit theirfriends. At length the Carthaginians threw among theRomans beams furnished at the ends with iron hooks,which the soldiers call harpoons. They could neithercut the beams, nor the chains by which they wereraised in order to be thrown, so that as soon as any ofthe ships of war, hauling back, dragged a transportentangled by the hook, the fastenings of these vesselsbroke, and in some places several were dragged awaytogether. By this means, chiefly, were all the bridgestorn asunder; and scarcely had the defenders time tomake their escape into the second row of ships. Aboutsix were towed away to Carthage, where the joy of thepeople was greater than the occasion merited. Butthey were the more sensibly affected because this gleamof good fortune, however small, had unexpectedlyshone on them, in the midst of a continued course oflosses and lamentations. It appeared that the Romanfleet would hardly have escaped destruction had nottheir own commanders been dilatory, so that Scipiohad time to bring in relief.

jEtolia and Acarnania; and on their sides, Locrisand Boeotia. Phanotea in Phocis he took withoutdifficulty at the first assault. The siege of Anticyragave him not much delay. Then Ambrysis and Hyam-polis were taken. Daulis, being situated on a loftyeminence, could not be reduced either by scalade orworks: he therefore provoked the garrison by missileweapons to make sallies from out the town. Then byflying at one time, pursuing at another, and engagingin slight skirmishes, he led them into such a degreeof carelessness, and such a contempt of him, that atlength the Romans, mixing with them as they ranback, entered by the gates, and stormed the town. Sixother fortresses in Phocis, of little consequence, cameinto his hands, through fear rather than by force ofarms. Elatia shut its gates, and the inhabitants seemeddetermined not to admit within their walls either thearmy or the general of the Romans, unless compelledby force.
19. While the consul was employed in the siege ofElatia, a prospect opened to him of effecting a businessof much more importance; of being able to prevail onthe Achaeans to renounce their alliance with Philip,and attach themselves to the Romans. Gycliades, thehead of the faction that favored the interest of Philip,they had now banished; and Aristainus, who wishedfor a union between his countrymen and the Romans,was pretor. The Roman fleet, with Attalus and theRhodians, lay at Cenchrea, and were preparing to laysiege to Corinth with their whole combined force. Theconsul therefore judged it prudent that, before theyentered on that affair, ambassadors should be sent tothe Aohasan state, with assurances that if they cameover from the king to the side of the Romans, the latterwould consign Corinth to them, and annex it to theold confederacy of their nation. Accordingly, by theconsul's direction, ambassadors were sent to the Achas-ans, by his brother Lucius Quintius, by Attalus, andby the Rhodians and Athenians—a general assemblybeing summoned to meet at Sicyon to give them audi­

Gauls, was, with almost the whole of his army, at­tacked at disadvantage and overthrown. He lost abovesix thousand six hundred men,—a severe blow from anenemy who had for some time ceased to be consideredas being formidable. This event called away the con­sul, Lucius Lentulus, from the city; who, arriving inthe province, which was in general confusion, andtaking the command of the army, which he found dis­pirited by its defeat, severely reprimanded the pretor,and ordered him to quit the province, and return toRome. Neither did the consul himself perform anyconsiderable service, being called home to preside atthe elections, which were obstructed by Marcus Ful-vius and Manius Curius, plebeian tribunes, who wishedto hinder Titus Quintius Flamininus from standing can­didate for the consulship, after passing through the of­fice of questor. They alleged that 'the edileship andpretorship were now held in contempt, and that thenobility did not make their way to the consulshipthrough the regular gradations of offices; but, passingover the intermediate steps, pushed at once from thelowest to the highest.' From a dispute in the field ofMars, the affair was brought before the senate, whereit was voted 'that when a person sued for any post,which by the laws he was permitted to hold, the peo­ple had the right of choosing whoever they thoughtproper.' To this decision of the senate the tribunessubmitted, and thereon Sextus jElius Paetus and TitusQuintius Flamininus were elected. Then was held theelection of pretors. The persons chosen were LuciusCornelius Merula, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, MarcusPorcius Cato, and Cains Helvius, who had been ple­beian ediles. These repeated the plebeian games, and,on occasion of the games, celebrated a feast of Jupiter.The curule ediles, also, Caius Valerius Flaccus, whowas flamen of Jupiter, and Caius Cornelius Cethegus,celebrated the Roman games with great magnificence.Servius and Caius Sulpicius Galba, pontiffs, died thisyear: in their room, in the college, were substitutedMarcus jEmilius Lepidus and Cneius Cornelius Scipio.

death. The Romans who escaped the slaughter of thisdisastrous day fled, half armed, by different roads intoSamnium, to the consul Marcellus.
2. Marcellus, not too much dismayed by so great adisaster, wrote to Rome to the senate an account of thegeneral and army being lost at Herdonea; adding, thatnotwithstanding this misfortune, ' he, who had quelledthe haughty spirit of Hannibal, when his confidencewas at the highest, in consequence of his victory atCannae, was now going against him, with the samedegree of resolution, and would take effectual carethat his present joy and exultation should be short.'At Rome, as people's grief for the past was great, sowere their fears of the future. The consul, passingover from Samnium into Lucania, pitched his camp atNumistro, on level ground, within view of Hannibal,who was posted on a bill. He gave, besides, anotherproof of confidence in his own strength, for he was thefirst to offer battle: nor did Hannibal, on seeing thestandards advance through the gates, decline the chal­lenge. However, they drew up their forces in sucha manner, that the right wing of the Carthaginiansstretched up the hill, and the left wing of the Romanswas brought close to the town. From the third hourthe action had lasted until night, and the fatigue offighting for such a length of time had overpowered theforemost lines, consisting, on the side of the Romans,of the first legion and the right wing of allies; onHannibal's side, of the Spanish infantry, Balearicslingers, and the elephants, which, at the beginning ofthe engagement, had been brought into the field. Andnow the fight flagged for a considerable time, neitherparty having gained any advantage, when the thirdlegion advanced into the place of the first, and the leftwing of the allies into that of the right; on the side ofthe enemy, likewise, the wearied were relieved byfresh troops. On this, both parties being in full spi­rits and vigor, instead of the former languid efforts, afurious conflict at once arose; but night separated thecombatants before the victory could be decided.

39. The consul Claudius, having at last set out fromthe city, was overtaken by a violent storm betweenthe ports of Cosa and Laureta, and brought into immi­nent danger; however, having got as far as Populonii,where he continued until a change of weather, he pro­ceeded to the island Ilva; from Ilva to Corsica, andfrom thence to Sardinia. There, as he was sailing bythe Mad Mountains, a still more furious tempest sur­prised him, and dispersed his fleet. Many ships weredamaged, and lost their rigging, and several werewrecked. In this harassed and shattered condition thefleet arrived at Carales, where the winter came onthem, while they were employed in docking and re­pairing the ships. Meanwhile the year coming to aconclusion, and it not being proposed to continue himin command, Tiberius Claudius, after he had ceasedto hold any public office, brought home the fleet.Marcus Servilius, having nominated Caius ServiliusGeminus dictator, lest he might be recalled on accountof the elections, set out for his province. The dictatornamed Publius jElius Paetus master of the horse.The elections, though many days were appointed forthe purpose, were still prevented by storms; so thatthe magistrates of the former year going out of office,on the day preceding the ides of March, and no suc­cessors being appointed, the state was without curulemagistrates.

had enlarged their empire more hy their lenity to thevanquished, than by their victories.' The discourse ofthe others was more calculated to excite compassion:they represented, ' to what a low state, from an exaltedheight, the affairs of the Carthaginians had fallen.That they who had lately extended the power of theirarms over almost the whole world, had now little leftthem except the walls of Carthage. Shut up withinthese, they could see nothing, either on land or sea,that they could call their own. Even of the city itself,and of their habitations, they had no other tenure,than the Romans not choosing to wreak their ven­geance on those also, when no other object for it nowremained.' When it appeared that the fathers weremoved by compassion, one of the senators, it is said,incensed at the perfidy of the Carthaginians, calledout to them, and asked, ' What gods they would nowinvoke as witnesses in the pending treaty, havingbroken faith with those in whose name the former onewas concluded.'—' The same,' said Hasdrubal, 'whonow show such resentment against the violators oftreaties.'
43. The minds of all inclining to peace, Cneius Len-tulus, consul, whose province was the fleet, protestedagainst the senate passing a decree. On which the tri­bunes, Manius Acilius and Quintus Manucius, put thequestion to the people, ' Whether they would chooseand order the senate to decree that peace should bemade with the Carthaginians; whom they would orderto grant peace, and whom to conduct the armies homefrom Africa?' All the tribes unanimously passed thequestion as it was put, and ordered Publius Scipio togrant the peace, and also to conduct the armies home.In consequence of this order of the people, the senatedecreed that Publius Scipio, in consort with the tenambassadors, should conclude a peace with the peopleof Carthage, on such terms as he should judge proper.The Carthaginians, then, after returning thanks to thesenate, requested that they might be permitted to enterthe city, and to converse with their countrymen, who,

and what number of men he should carry to Africa;with orders also to all the sea-coast that the ships ofburden should be all seized, and brought thither.When the troops and vessels had assembled at Lily-baeum, neither could the city contain the men, nor theharbor the ships; and such an ardent desire to passinto Africa possessed them all, that they appeared, notas if going to be employed in war, but in receiving therewards of victory already secured; especially those ofthe army of Cannae; for they expected, by exertingthemselves on the present occasion, and under thethen general, to put an end to their ignominious ser­vice. Scipio showed not the least inclination to re­ject soldiers of that description, knowing that the mis­fortune at Cannae had not arisen from their want ofspirit, and that, besides, there were none in the Ro­man army who had served so long, or who had ac­quired so much experience, both in a variety of battles,and in attacking towns. The legions of Cannse werethe fifth and sixth. After giving notice that he wouldcarry these to Africa, he reviewed them, man by man,and leaving behind such as he thought unfit for theservice, he substituted in their places those whom hehad brought from Italy, and filled up those legionsin such a manner, that each contained six thousandtwo hundred foot, and three hundred horse; the horseand foot of the allies, of the Latine confederacy, hechose also out of the army of Cannae.

In one I find tenthousand foot, and two thousand two hundred horse;in another sixteen thousand foot, and one thousand sixhundred horse; while others augment them more thanhalf, and assert that thirty-five thousand horse andfoot were put on board the ships. Some have notstated the numbers; and among these, as the matter isuncertain, I choose to place myself.

After recover­ing Thronium in the manner related, he continued bisroute; and, haying taken Tritonos and Drymae, incon­siderable towns of Doris, he came thence to Elatia,where he had ordered the ambassadors of Ptolemyand the Rhodians to wait for him. While they weredeliberating there on the method of putting an end tothe jEtolian war, (for the ambassadors had been pre­sent at the late assembly of the Romans and JStoliansat Heraclea,) news was brought that Machanidasintended to attack the people of Elis while theywere busied in preparations for solemnising the Olym­pic games. Judging it incumbent on him to preventsuch an attempt, he dismissed the ambassadors with afavorable answer, that ' he had neither given cause forthe war, nor would give any obstruction to a peace,provided it could be procured on just and honorableterms:' then, proceeding through Boeotia by quickmarches, he came down to Megara, and from thenceto Corinth; and, receiving there supplies of provision,repaired to Phlius and Pheneus. When he had ad­vanced as far as Heraea, intelligence was brought himthat Machanidas, terrified at the account of his ap­proach, had retreated to Lacedaemon; on which hewithdrew to yEgium, where the Achaeans were assem­bled in council, expecting at the same time to meetthere a Carthaginian fleet which he had sent for, inorder that he might be able to undertake some enter­prise by sea. But the Carthaginians had left thatplace a few days before, and were gone to the Oxeanislands, and from thence, (on hearing that the Romansand Attalns had left Oreum,) to the harbors of theAcarnanians; for they apprehended that an attackwas intended against themselves, and that they mightbe overpowered while within the straits of Rhios (sothe entrance of the Corinthian bay is called).

from the king to Scipio had an interview with him atSyracuse. Scipio, though disappointed in a matter ofthe utmost consequence to the success of his affairs inAfrica, and in the high expectations which he had en­tertained from that quarter, sent back the ambassadorsspeedily, before their business should become publiclyknown, and gave them a letter for the king, in whichhe conjured him, in the most forcible terms, not ' toviolate the laws of hospitality; nor the alliance whichhe had concluded with the Roman people; nor justice,nor faith (their right hands pledged); nor act in anything offensive to the gods, the witnesses and guaran­tees of compacts.' The coming of the Numidians wasgenerally known, for they had walked about the city,and had been frequently at the pretorium ; so that it wasfeared, should the subject of their embassy transpire,that the troops might become alarmed at the prospectof being to fight against Syphax and the Carthaginians.Scipio judged it prudent therefore to divert theirthoughts from the truth, by prepossessing them withfalse informations. Calling them to an assembly, hesaid, 'that there was no room for longer delay: thatthe kings, their allies, pressed him to pass over toAfrica immediately. That Masinissa had before comein person to Laelius, complaining of time being wastedin inactivity; and that Syphax now sent dispatchesto the like effect; requiring, that either the troopsshould at length be carried over to Africa, or ifthe plan was changed, that he should be made ac­quainted with it, in order that he might adopt suchmeasures as would be convenient to himself andbeneficial to his kingdom. Since, therefore, everypreparation had been made, and as the business ad­mitted no longer hesitation, it was his intention, afterbringing over the fleet to Lilybaeum, and assemblingat that place all the forces of horse and foot, to passinto Africa, with the favor of the gods, the first day onwhich the ships could sail.' He sent a letter to MarcusPomponius, to come to that port, in order that theymight consult together as to what particular legions,

laid waste the lands of the Apollonians, and, marchinghis forces up to the city, offered the Romans battle;they, however, remained quiet, only defending thewalls, while his force was insufficient for laying siege tothe place. He was yet desirous of concluding a peacewith the Romans, as with the vEtolians; or, if thatcould not be accomplished, of obtaining a truce; and,not choosing to provoke their resentment farther by anew contest, he withdrew into his own kingdom. Atthe same time the Epirots, wearied by the length ofthe war, having first tried the disposition of the Ro­mans, sent ambassadors to Philip concerning a generalpeace; affirming that they were very confident itmight be brought about, if he would come to a confer­ence with Publius Sempronius, the Roman general.They easily prevailed on him to pass into Epirus, for theking himself was not averse from the measure. Thereis a city in Epirus called Phoenice ; there Philip, havingconferred with Eropus, and Dardas, and Philip, pre-tors of the Epirots, had afterwards a meeting withPublius Sempronius. Amynander also, king of theAthamanians, was present at the conference togetherwith other magistrates of the Epirots and Acarnanians.Philip the pretor spoke first, and intreated both theking and the Roman general to put an end to hostili­ties; and to consider, in a favorable light, the libertywhich the Epirots took in mediating between them.Publius Sempronius dictated the terms of peace:—That the Parthinians, and Dimallum, and Bargulum,and Bugenium, should be under the dominion of theRomans; that Atintania should be ceded to the Mace­donian, if, on sending ambassadors, he should obtainit from the senate. Peace being agreed to on theseterms, the king included in the treaty Prusias, king ofBithynia, the Achaean!, Boeotians, Thessalians, Acar­nanians, and Epirots. On the side of the Romanswere included the Ilians, king Attalus, Pleuratus,Nabis, tyrant of the Lacedaemonians, the Eleans,Messenians, and Athenians.

behavior; for, laying aside his diadem, purple robe,and other royal apparel, he set himself, with respect toappearance, on a level with the rest; than which no­thing can be more grateful to the people of free states.This conduct would have afforded very strong hopesof general liberty had he not debased and dishonoredall by intolerable debauchery: for, night and day, withone or two attendants, he ranged through the houses ofmarried people. He had lowered his dignity to thecommon level, consequently the less conspicuous heappeared the less restraint he was under; and thus theliberty of which he had given others an empty pros­pect, he stretched to the utmost in the gratification ofhis own unlawful desires. Money and seductive dis­courses were not always sufficient for his purposes; heeven employed violence in aid of them, and dangerouswas it for husbands and parents to show inflexiblestrictness in obstructing the brutal passions of theking. He took from Aratus (a man of distinctionamong the Achaeans) his wife, named Polycratia; and,deluding her with the hope of being married to a so­vereign prince, carried her into Macedonia. Afterspending the time of the celebration of the games, andseveral days after they were finished, in this scanda­lous manner, he marched to Dymae, with design todislodge a garrison of the jEtolians, who had beeninvited by the Eleans, and received into that city.At Dyma? he was joined by the Achssans, under Cy-cliades their chief magistrate, who were inflamed withhatred against the Eleans, because they refused to unitewith the other states of Achaia, and highly incensedagainst the jEtolians, whom they believed to be theauthors of the war carried on against them by theRomans. Leaving Dymas, and uniting their forces,they passed the river Larissus, which separates theterritory of Elis from that of Dymes.

Laving gone from Demetrias to Scotussa, and settingout thence at the third watch, dislodged the guard,routed the ^Etolians who kept possession of the passof Thermopylae, and drove the dismayed enemy toHeraclea, accomplishing in one day a march of abovesixty miles to Elatia in Phocis. About the same timethe city of Opus was taken and plundered by Attalus.Sulpicius had given it up to the king, because Oreumhad been sacked a few days before by the Roman sol­diers, and his men had received no share. After theRoman fleet had retired to Oreum, Attalus, not ap­prised of Philip's approach, wasted time in levyingcontributions from the principal inhabitants; and sounexpected was his coming, that, had not some Cre­tans, who happened to go in quest of forage fartherfrom the town than usual, espied the enemy, he mighthave been surprised. Without arms, and in the ut­most confusion, he fled precipitately to his ships. Justas they were putting off from the land, Philip cameup, and though he did not advance from the shore, yethis arrival caused a good deal of confusion among themariners. From thence he returned to Opus, inveigh­ing against gods and men for his disappointment inhaving the opportunity of striking so important a blowthus snatched from him, and when almost within reachof his arm. The Opuntians, also, he rebuked in angryterms, because, although they might have prolongedthe siege until he arrived, yet they had immediately,on sight of the enemy, made almost a voluntary sur­render. Having put affairs at Opus in order, he pro­ceeded thence to Thronium. On the other side, At­talus at first retired to Oreum, but having heard therethat Prnsias, king of Bithynia, had invaded his king­dom, he laid aside all attention to the affairs ofthe Romans and the jEtolian war, and passed overinto Asia. Sulpicius, too, withdrew his fleet to Mgi-na, from whence he had set out in the beginning ofspring. Philip found as little difficulty in possessinghimself of Thronium, as Attalus had met at Opus.This city was inhabited by foreigners, natives of

27. The consul, Sulpicius, who was at that time en­camped on the river Apsus, between Apollonia andDyrrachium, having ordered Lucius Apustius, lieute­nant-general, thither, sent him with part of the forcesto lay waste the enemy's country. Apustius, afterravaging the frontiers of Macedonia, and having, atthe first assault, taken the forts of Corragos, Gerru-nios, and Orgessos, came to Antipatria, a city situatedin a narrow vale; where, at first inviting the leadingmen to a conference, he endeavored to prevail onthem to put themselves under the protection of theRomans; but finding that from confidence in the size,fortifications, and situation of their city, they paid noregard to his discourse, he attacked the place by forceof arms, and took it by assault: then, putting all theyoung men to the sword, and giving up the intirespoil to his soldiers, he rased the walls, and burnedthe buildings. This proceeding spread such terror,that Codrion, a strong and well fortified town, sur­rendered to the Romans without a struggle. Leavinga garrison there, he took Ilion by force, a name betterknown than the town, on account of that of the same deno­mination in Asia. As the lieutenant-general was return­ing to the consul with a great quantity of spoil, Athe-nagoras, one of the king's generals, falling on his rear,in its passage over a river, threw it into disorder.On hearing the shouting and tumult, Apustius rodeback in full speed, ordered the troops to face about,and drew them up in order, with the baggage in thecentre. The king's troops could not support the on­set of the Roman soldiers: so that many of them wereslain, and more made prisoners. The lieutenant-gene­ral, having brought back the army without loss to theconsul, was ordered to return immediately to the fleet.liv. vol. v. x

Of the pre­tors, the city jurisdiction fell to Lucius Quintius,Ariminum to Cneius Basbius, Sicily to Lucius Vale­rius, Sardinia to Lucius Villius. The consul, Lentu­lus, was ordered to levy new legions; Villius to re­ceive the army from Publius Sulpicius; and, to com­plete its number, power was given him to raise as manymen as he thought proper. To the pretor Baebiuswere decreed the legions, which Caius Aurelius, lateconsul, had commanded, with directions that he shouldkeep them in their present situation until the consulshould come with the new army to supply their place;and that, on his arriving in Gaul, all the soldiers whohad served out their time should be sent home, exceptfive thousand of the allies, which would be sufficient toprotect the province round Ariminum.

But I think it better to de­fer the subject of our changes of party to anothertime; and that for two reasons: first, that it may bediscussed in the presence of Publius Scipio, who re­gained possession of Locri, and was a witness of ourbehavior, whether good or bad; and secondly, that,let our conduct have been what it may, we ought notto have suffered the evils which have been poured onus. We cannot, conscript fathers, disown, that whilewe had a Carthaginian garrison, we suffered manycruelties and indignities, as well from Hamilcar thecommander there, as from' the Numidians and Afri­cans. But what are these, when compared with whatwe this day endure? I request, conscript fathers, thatyou will hear, without being offended, what I unwill­ingly mention. All mankind are in suspense whetherthey are to see you or the Carthaginians sovereigns ofthe world. Now, if an estimation were to be formedof the Roman and Carthaginian governments from thetreatment which we of Locri have borne on the onehand, and from that which on the other we at this pre­sent time bear, without remission, from your garrison,there is no one who would not rather choose Africansthan Romans for his masters. Yet, observe what dis­positions the Locrensiaus have, notwithstanding, showntowards you. When we were ill treated by the Car­thaginians in a much less degree, we had recourse toyour general for redress. Now, when we suffer fromyour garrison worse than hostile cruelty, we have car­ried our complaints to no other but to you. Conscriptfathers, you will consider our desperate situation, orwe are left without any resource for which we caneven pray to the immortal gods.

People in general expressed a desire that Africashould be constituted a new province, and assigned toPublius Scipio without casting lots; and he, not con­tent with a moderate share of glory, affirmed that hehad been appointed consul, not for the purpose onlyof carrying on the war, but of finishing it; that thiscould be accomplished by no other means than bytransporting an army into Africa; declaring openly,that if the senate should oppose him in that point, hewould carry it by the votes of the people. The prin­cipal senators by no means approved of the design;and whilst the rest, either through fear or a desire ofingratiating themselves with him, declined utteringtheir sentiments, Quintus Fabius Maximus, being askedhis opinion, expressed himself to this effect: 'I know,conscript fathers, that many among you are of opinionthat we are this day deliberating on an affair alreadydetermined; and that he will expend words to littlepurpose who shall deliver his sentiments on the subjectof Africa being constituted a province, as on a matteropen to discussion.

Not that I wish this behavior should beimputed to you all: I assure you, if I could believethat my whole army wished my death, I would here,this instant, die before your eyes; nor could life affordme any pleasure if it were displeasing to my country­men and soldiers.

nian ships which had been dispersed were taken bythe Roman fleet. Such were the occurrences by landand sea, on that side of Italy nearest to the Alps. Theconsul Cneius Servilius performed nothing memo­rable in Etruria, or in Gaul (for he bad advanced intothat country), except that he rescued from slavery,which they had endured for sixteen years, his father,Cains Servilius, and his uncle Caius Lutatius, whohad been taken by the Boians at the village of Tane-tum. He returned to Rome accompanied by these oneach side of him, distinguished rather by family-badges than public services. It was proposed to thepeople, that ' Cneius Servilius should not be subjectto penalty, for having, contrary to the laws, duringthe life of his father (a circumstance of which he wasat that time ignorant), and who sat in the curule chair,accepted the offices of tribune of the commons, andplebeian edile;' this being admitted, he returned tohis province. Consentia, Uffugum, Vergae, Besidiae,Hetriculum, Sypheum, Argentanum, Clampetia, andmany other small states, perceiving that the Cartha­ginians grew languid in their operations, came over toCneius Servilius the consul, then in Bruttium; andwho had fought a battle with Hannibal in the districtof Croton, of which we have no clear account. Va­lerius Autias says that five thousand of the enemywere slain. This is a circumstance of such impor­tance, that either it must be an impudent fiction, orthey were guilty of great negligence who omittedmentioning it. It is certain that Hannibal made nofarther efforts in Italy, for deputies came to him fromCarthage, recalling him to Africa, nearly at the sametime with Mago.

meeting success in either engagement. But, besidesthe natural presumptuousness of his temper, he ac­quired confidence from a treaty which he had formedwith Antiochus, king of Syria, in which they had di­vided the wealth of Egypt between them; an objectwhich, on hearing of the death of Ptolemy, they wereboth eager to secure. As to the Athenians, they hadentangled themselves in a war with Philip on too tri­fling an occasion, and at a time when they retainednothing of their ancient dignity but pride. Duringthe celebration of the mysteries, two young men ofAcarnania, who were not initiated, unapprised of itsbeing an offence against religion, entered the templeof Ceres along with the rest of the crowd: their dis­course quickly betrayed them, by their asking ques­tions which discovered their ignorance; whereon, be­ing carried before the presidents of the temple, althoughit was evident that they went in through mistake, yetthey were put to death, as if for a heinous crime. TheAcarnanian nation made complaint to Philip of thisbarbarous and hostile act, and prevailed on him togrant them some aid of Macedonian soldiers, and toallow {hem to make war on the Athenians. At firstthis army, after ravaging the lands of Attica with fireand sword, retired to Acarnania with booty of allkinds. This was the first provocation to hostilities.The Athenians afterwards, on their side, entered intoa regular war, and proclaimed it by order of the state:for king Attalus and the Rhodians, having come toJEgina in pursuit of Philip, who was retiring to Mace­donia, the king crossed over to Piraeus, for the purposeof renewing and strengthening the alliance betweenhim and the Athenians. On entering the city he wasreceived by the whole inhabitants, who poured forthwith their wives and children to meet him; by thepriests, with their emblems of religion; and in a man­ner by the gods themselves, called forth from theirabodes.

It had been concerted between the consuls,by letter, that as they had been of one mind in the ma­nagement of affairs, so they should arrive together at onetime in the city, though they were to come from diffe­rent quarters; whichever came first to Praeneste beingdirected to wait there for his colleague. It so hap­pened that they both arrived at that town on the sameday; and then, having sent forward a proclamation,requiring a full meeting of the senate in the temple ofBellona on the third day after, they advanced to­wards the city, from whence the whole multitudepoured out to meet them. The surrounding crowdswere not satisfied with saluting them, though but ata little distance; each pressed eagerly forward totouch the victorious hands of the consuls; some con­gratulating, others giving them thanks for having bytheir valor procured safety to the state. In the se­nate, having given a recital of their exploits, accord­ing to the usual practice of commanders of armies,they demanded that, ' on account of their bravery andsuccess in the conduct of affairs, due honors might bepaid to the immortal gods, and they themselves al­lowed to enter the city in triumph.' To which the se­nate answered, that ' they decreed with pleasure thematters contained in their demand, as a proper return,due, first to the gods, and, after the gods, to the con­suls.' A thanksgiving in the name of both, and atriumph to each, had been decreed: the consuls, how­ever, wishing that, as their sentiments had been unitedduring the course of the war, their triumphs shouldnot be separated, came to this agreement betweenthemselves,—that, 'inasmuch as the business had beenaccomplished within the province of Marcus Livius,and as, on the day whereon the battle was fought, ithappened to be his turn to command, and as the armyof Livius had been withdrawn and was now at Rome,while Nero's could not be withdrawn from the pro­vince; it should on all these accounts be ordered thatMarcus Livius make his entry in a chariot, drawn by

And now the battalions also of the legions ap­proached, when the Masaesylians, so far from daringto meet their first attack, could not support even thesight of their engines and arms; so strongly were theyaffected, either by the recollection of their former ca­lamities, or by the present danger. At this junctureSyphax, galloping up to try if, either by shame or bythe danger to which he was exposed, he could stop theflight of his men, being thrown from his horse, whichwas grievously wounded, was overpowered and taken,and dragged alive to Laelius ;—a sight grateful to Ma-sinissa above all others. To Cirtha, the capital ofSyphax's kingdom, a vast multitude fled. The num­ber of slain in that battle was less than in proportionto the greatness of the victory, because the cavalryonly had been engaged. Not more than five thousandwere killed; less than half that number taken, in anattack on their camp, to which the multitude had re­tired in dismay at the loss of their king. r

Masinissa declared that ' nothing could be morehighly gratifying to him, now that he was victorious,after so long a struggle, than to revisit his paternalkingdom: but that the present happy situation of bisaffairs required activity, as much as his former mis­fortunes. If Laelius would permit him to go on beforehim to Cirtha, with the cavalry, and Syphax as hisprisoner, he would strike such terror, while the enemywere in confusion and dismay, as would crush all oppo­sition; and that Laslius might follow with the infantryby easy marches.' Laslius assenting, he went forwardto Cirtha, and ordered the principal inhabitants to beinvited to a conference.

That these were the terms of peace which heprescribed:—that they should give up the prisoners,deserters, and fugitives; withdraw their armies fromItaly and Gaul'; renounce all pretensions to Spain;retire from all the islands which lie between Italy andAfrica; deliver up all their ships of war, except twenty,and furnish five hundred thousand measures of wheat,and three hundred thousand of barley.' What sum ofmoney he demanded, authors are not agreed. In some,I find five thousand talents;i in others, five thousandpounds weight of silver; while it is also said thatdouble pay of the troops was imposed. 'Three days,'said he, ' shall be allowed you to consider whether youapprove of peace on these conditions. If you do ap­prove of it, then make a truce with me, and send am­bassadors to Rome to the senate.' The Carthaginians,thus dismissed, thought it advisable to submit to anyterms, as the only object they had in view was to gaintime, until Hannibal should come over to Africa; andtherefore they sent ambassadors to Scipio, to concludea truce, and others to Rome to solicit peace. Thesecarried with them a few prisoners, deserters, and fugi­tives, to make a show of obedience, and that they mightattain their object with the less difficulty.

But, after all this, he usedto give his vote either by a single word, or by going tothe side of the house which he approved, until a trialcame on in the cause of Marcus Livius Macatus, a manto whom he was related, and whose character was atstake; and this obliged him to deliver his sentimentsat large in the senate. The speech which he made,after so long an interval of silence, drew on him alleyes, and became the subject of much conversation:it was asserted that ' the people had treated him withgreat injustice, and that the consequences of this unde­served ill-treatment had been highly injurious to thatvery people; as, during a war of such importance anddanger, the state had been deprived both of the ser­vices and counsels of so great a man. With CaiusNero, neither Quintus Fabius nor Marcus ValeriusLaevinus could be joined in office, because the law didnot allow the election of two patricians. The sameobjection lay against Titus Manlius, besides that hehad before refused the offer of the consulship, andwould again refuse it. But if the election of MarcusLivius, in conjunction with Caius Nero, could be ef­fected, then they would have such consuls as couldscarcely be equalled.' Nor were the commons disin­clined to the proposal, although it took its rise fromthe patricians. One only person in the state, the per­son to whom the honor was offered, objected to themeasure; charging the people with levity and incon­stancy, he said, that 'when he appeared before themin the situation of a defendant, in a mourning habit,they refused him their compassion; yet now theyforced on him the white gown against his will, heaping

The milder opinion prevailed, thatthe punishment should be confined to those who werethe instigators to it, and that for the multitude a re­primand was sufficient. As soon as the council wasdismissed orders were issued to the army which wasin Carthage to prepare for an expedition against Man-donius and Indibilis, and to get ready provisions forseveral days, in order that people might think thatthis had been the business of the meeting. Then theseven tribunes, who had before gone to Sucro to quellthe disturbance, were again sent out to gather fartherinformation on the matter, when each of them made areturn of five names of the leaders of it; with the in­tent that proper persons, appointed for the purpose,should invite these, with friendly countenance and dis­course, to their lodgings, and that there, when stupi-fied with wine, they might be secured in chains. Whenthey came near Carthage they heard, from some per­sons on the road, that the whole army was to set outnext day, with Marcus Silanus, against the Laceta-nians, which not only freed the disaffected from theapprehensions which, though concealed, lay heavy ontheir minds, but occasioned great joy amongst them;as they supposed that the general would be left alone,in their power, instead of their being in his. A littlebefore sunset they entered the city, and saw the otherarmy busy in preparations for a march: they were re­ceived with discourses framed for the purpose, that* their coming was highly agreeable and convenient tothe general, as it had happened just before the departureof the other army;' after which they retired to refreshthemselves. The authors of the mutiny, having beenconducted to lodgings by the persons appointed, were,without any tumult, apprehended by the tribunes, andthrown into chains.

sovereignty, both by land and sea, over foreign realms.I am far from denying that you have some reason todistrust the faith of the Carthaginians, on account ofthe insincerity which they showed in their solicitations,and in not waiting the issue of the negotiation. Scipio,the security of a peace being observed depends muchon the character of those who sue for it. Your senate,I hear, refused to grant it, partly from the considera­tion that the persons employed in the embassy werenot sufficiently respectable. Hannibal sues for peace,who would not sue for it unless he thought it expedient;and who on account of the same expediency which in­duces him to sue for it, will also maintain it. And asbecause the war was begun by me, I took effectualcare, until the gods themselves declared against me,that my countrymen should have no reason to com­plain of it, so will I exert my utmost endeavors tomake them satisfied with a peace procured by anymeans.'
31. The Roman general answered to this effect:'Hannibal, it was not unknown to me that their ex­pectation of your arrival was what urged the Cartha­ginians to violate the truce subsisting, and to break offthe treaty of peace. Nor do you dissemble it; as youdeduct from the former conditions every particular,except those which are, for some time past, in ourown power. But as you are solicitous that your coun­trymen should understand how great a burden theyare relieved from by your means, so it is my bu­siness to endeavor that they shall not now retractthe concessions which they then agreed to make, andenjoy what they then ceded, as a reward of theirperfidy. Unworthy of being allowed the same terms,you require additional advantages in consequence ofyour treachery. Neither were our fathers the ag­gressors in the war of Sicily, nor we in that ofSpain. In the former case the danger of their alliesthe Mamertines; in the latter, the destruction of Sa-guntum, armed us in the cause of justice and of duty.That you were the aggressors, you yourself acknow­

animals began to grow furious, and to rush on theirown party, the manager of each, fixing this instrumentbetween its ears, on the joint which connects the headwith tbe neck, drove it in with the strongest blow thathe could give. This had been found the speediest me­thod of killing animals of that great size, when theyhad become so unruly as to leave no hope of managingthem; and it had been first brought into practice byHasdrubal, whose conduct in the command of an army,as on many other occasions, so particularly in thisbattle, merited very high encomiums. By his exhor­tations, and by taking an equal share in the dangers,he supported the spirits of his men ; and at one timeby intreaties, at another by reproofs, he reanimatedthe wearied, when, from the length and labor of theaction, they were disposed to lay down their arms.He called back the ffying, and restored the battle inmany places where it had been given up. At last,when Fortune evidently declared for the Romans, un­willing to survive so great an army, which had fol­lowed his standard on the credit of his reputation, heset spurs to his horse, and plunged himself into themidst of a Roman cohort; where, as became the sonof Hamilcar, and the brother of Hannibal, he fell fight­ing. In no one action, during that war, were so greatnumbers of the enemy slain; so much so, indeed, thatthe damage retorted on him was deemed equivalent tothat sustained at Cannse. Fifty-six thousand of themwere killed, and five thousand four hundred taken.The other booty was great of every kind, as well as ofgold and silver. Besides which, there were recoveredabove four thousand Roman citizens, prisoners, whichwas some consolation for the soldiers lost in the battle;for the victory was far from a bloodless one, nearlyeight thousand of the Romans and allies being killed.And so far were even the victors satiated with bloodand slaughter, that next day, when the consul Liviuswas told that the Cisalpine Gauls and Ligurians, whohad either not been present in the battle, or had madetheir escape from the general carnage, were marching

their country; adding, that ' they did not complain onaccount of having, from an enemy, suffered hostiletreatment; for there were certain rights of war, ac­cording to which, as it was just to act, so it was justto endure. Their crops being burned, their housesdemolished, their men and cattle carried off as spoil,were to be considered rather as misfortunes to thesufferer, than as ill treatment. But of this they hadgood reason to complain, that he who called theRomans foreigners and barbarians, had so atrociouslyviolated, himself, all rights both divine and human, as,in his former inroad, to have waged an impious waragainst the infernal gods, in the latter against thoseabove. That every sepulchre and monument withintheir country was demolished, the graves torn open,and the bones left uncovered. There had been seve­ral temples, which, in former times, when their an­cestors dwelt in the country in their separate districts,had been consecrated in each of their little forts andvillages, and which, even after they were incorporatedinto one city, they did not neglect or forsake. Everyone of these sacred edifices had Philip destroyed byfire, and left the images of the gods lying scorched andmutilated among the prostrated pillars of the temples.Such as he had rendered the country of Attica, for­merly opulent, and adorned with improvements, such,if he were suffered, would he render jEtolia and everypart of Greece. That Athens, also, would have beenreduced to the same ruinous state, if the Romans hadnot come to its relief: for he had shown the samewicked rage against the gods, who are the guardiansof the city, and Minerva, who presides over thecitadel; the same against the temple of Ceres atEleusis; the same against Jupiter and Minerva atPirasus. In a word, having been repelled by force ofarms, not only from their temples, but even from theirwalls, he had vented his fury on those sacred edifices,which had no defence but in the respect due to reli­gion. They therefore intreated and besought thejEtolians, that, compassionating the Athenians, and. following the guidance of the gods, and, under them,

Bythese honors conferred on him, the king's mind wassoothed, and encouraged to hope that he should soonbe in possession of the whole extent of Numidia, nowthat Syphax was removed out of his way.

Arriving atthe general's tent, they prostrated themselves, likethose who humbly fawn on kings, having learned thatmode, I suppose, from the country whence they de­rived their origin. Their discourse was suitable tosuch servile adulation, not attempting to apologise fortheir conduct, but transferring the blame on Hannibal,and the favorers of his violent measures. They im­plored pardon for their state, which bad been twiceruined by the rashness of its citizens, and would asecond time be indebted for its restoration to thegenerosity of an enemy: they observed that ' the Ro­man people sought dominion over the conquered, nottheir destruction; and declared themselves ready topay implicit obedience to any commands which their!subjugators should be pleased to impose.'

There were five thousand Carthaginians slain on thatday, and twenty-two military ensigns taken. Nor wasthe victory bloodless on the side of the Romans: twothousand three hundred men of the pretor's army werelost, by far the greater part of whom were of thetwelfth legion; of which legion also fell two militarytribunes, Marcus Gosconius and Marcus Maenius. Ofthe thirteenth legion, likewise, which had shared thelatter part of the engagement, Cneius Helvius, mili­tary tribune, was slain while employed in restoring thefight.

19. Mago, setting out during the silence of the nextnight, and making as long journeys as his wound al­lowed him to bear, arrived at the sea-coast, in thecountry of the Ingaunian Ligurians. There the depu­ties from Carthage, who had a few days before arrivedwith the ships in the Gallic bay, waited on him, anddelivered orders to him to pass over to Africa as soonas possible; informing him that his brother Hannibal,to whom messengers had been also sent, would do thesame, for the affairs of the Carthaginians were not ina condition to hold possession of Gaul and Italy byarms. Mago was not only moved by the commandsof the senate and the danger that threatened his coun­try, but dreaded lest, if he delayed, he might be hardpressed by the victorious enemy; and also, lest theLigurians themselves, seeing that the Carthaginianswere about to relinquish Italy, might revolt to thoseunder whose power they must speedily fall. He atthe same time entertained hopes that his wound mightbe less irritated on board a ship than on land, and thathe might there be able to attend to the cure of it withmore convenience.

cus Lucretius, plebeian tribune, proposing the ques­tion hereon, the senate decreed thus: 'That the con­sul, before he left the city, should consult the peopleas to whom they wished to be appointed dictator, andshould nominate to that office whomsoever they shouldorder. That if he refused this the pretor should holdthe meeting; and if he also were unwilling to do it,that then the tribunes should propose the question.'Valerius declared that he would not ask the judgmentof the people on a matter properly belonging to hisown jurisdiction, and he forbade it in the pretor; onwhich the plebeian tribunes proposed the question,and the commons ordered that Quintus Fulvius, thenat Capua, should be created dictator. But in the nightpreceding the day on which the assembly of the peoplewas to be held, the consul went off privately to Sicily;and the senate, left thus unsupported, took the reso­lution of ordering a letter to be sent to Marcus Clau­dius, desiring him to give assistance to the common­wealth, which his colleague had deserted, and to nomi­nate the dictator fixed on by the people. Accordingly,* Quintus Fulvius was nominated dictator by the con­sul Claudius; and in compliance with the same orderof the people, the dictator, Quintus Fulvius, namedPublius Licinius Crassus, then chief pontiff, master ofthe horse.
6. The dictator, on coming to Rome, sent CneiusSempronius lilassus, who had been a lieutenant-generalunder him at Capua, into the province of Etruria, totake the command of the army there, in the room ofthe pretor, Caius Calpurnius, whom he called away byletter, to command his own army at Capua. He ap­pointed for the elections the earliest day on whichthey could be held; but a dispute arising between thedictator and the tribunes, they could not be finishedon that day.

For whether you sutler Locri to con­tinue under the present lieutenant-general and garri­son, or deliver our countrymen up to Hannibal andthe Carthaginians, to be punished as their anger maydirect, it will be equally fatal to them. We do notrequire that you should, at once, give credit to us,and to charges made in the general's absence, or with­out allowing him to make his defence: let him come,let him hear them in person; let him clear himself ofthem, if he can. In fine, if there be any act of iniquitywhich one man can commit against others, that he hasnot committed against us, we consent, if it be possible,again to endure our griefs, and that he shall be ac­quitted of all guilt towards both gods and men.'
19. When the ambassadors had concluded their dis­course, being asked by Quintus Fabius whether theyhad laid those complaints before Publius Scipio, theyanswered, that ' an embassy had been sent to him, butthat he was taken up with the preparations for thewar; and that, either before this time he had passedover into Africa, or would do so in a very few days.That they had experienced what great interest thelieutenant-general had with the commander, when,after hearing the cause between him and the tribunes,he threw the tribunes into chains, and left the lieute­nant-general, who was equally guilty, or rather moreso, in possession of the same power as before.'

He did not, as usual, form the cohortsin close order each before their own colors, but placedthe companies at some distance from each other, thatthere might be room to admit the elephants of theenemy, without disturbing the ranks. Laelius, whoformerly served under him as lieutenant-general, butthat year as questor, by particular appointment, inpursuance of a decree of the senate, he posted withthe Italian cavalry on the left wing; Masinissa andthe Numidians on the right. The openings betweenthe companies of the cohorts he filled up with light-armed troops, and gave them directions on the attackof the elephants, either to retire to the rear of the files,or, opening to right and left, to form along with thecohorts, so as to leave a passage for those beasts,through which they might advance exposed on bothsides to their weapons. Hannibal, in order to striketerror, placed his elephants in the front; of these therewere eighty (a number greater than he had ever beforebrought into the field); next to them the auxiliary Li-gurians and Gauls, with the Balearians and Moors in­termixed. In the second line he placed the Carthagi­nians, Africans, and the legion of Macedonians; andthen, leaving a moderate interval, he formed the lineof reserve, consisting of Italian soldiers, chiefly Brut-tians, a greater number of whom followed him on hisdeparture from Italy by compulsion and through ne­cessity, rather than from inclination. He also coveredthe flanks with cavalry, the Carthaginians being postedon the right, the Numidians on the left. Various werethe methods of encouragement made use of amongsuch a number of men, differing from each other inlanguage, in manners, in laws, in arms, in garb, intemper, and in their motives for engaging in the ser­vice.

Tiberius Claudius Asellusand Marcus Junius Pennua were plebeian ediles. Inthat year Marcus Marcellus dedicated the temple ofVirtue, at the Capuan gate, seventeen years after ithad been vowed by his father at Clastidium in Gaul,during his first consulate. Marcus jEmilius Regillus,flamen of Mars, died that year.
12. During the two last years the affairs of Greecehad been neglected; a circumstance which enabledPhilip to reduce the jEtolians, thus forsaken by theRomans, on whose aid alone they relied. They weretherefore obliged to sue for, and agree to a peaceon such terms as the king should impose: but hadhe not used every effort to hasten the conclusionof it, Publius Sempronius, proconsul, who succeededSulpicius in the command, would have fallen on him(while engaged in settling the treaty) with ten thou­sand foot, one thousand horse, and thirty-five ships ofwar; no small force in support of an ally. The peacewas scarcely concluded, when news was brought toPhilip that the Romans had come to Dyrrachium;that the Parthinians, and other neighboring nations,seeing a prospect of changing their situation, were inmotion, and that Dimallum was besieged. The Ro­mans had turned their operations to that side, insteadof going forward to the assistance of the jEtolians,whither they had been sent, provoked at the peace thusmade with the king without their concurrence, andcontrary to the treaty. On the receipt of this news,Philip, fearing lest some greater commotions mightarise among the neighboring nations and states, pro­ceeded by long marches to Apollonia, to which placeSempronius had retired, after sending his lieutenant-general.

The league, how­ever, being ratified with Syphax, Scipio set sail; andafter being tossed a good deal during the voyage, byvariable and generally boisterous winds, he made theharbor of New Carthage on the fourth day.
19. As Spain had now rest from the Carthaginianwar, so it was manifest that some states remainedquiet rather through fear, arising from the conscious­ness of misbehavior, than through sincere attachment.The most remarkable of these, both in greatness andin guilt, were Illiturgi and Castulo. The inhabitantsof Castulo, allies of the Romans while they were suc­cessful, had, on the destruction of the first Scipios andtheir armies, revolted to the Carthaginians. Those ofIlliturgi, by betraying and killing such as had fled tothem after that calamity, had added barbarity to re­volt. To have executed severe vengeance on thosestates, at Scipio's first coming, when affairs in Spainwere in a precarious state, would have been moresuited to their demerits than agreeable to principles ofsound policy; but now, when affairs were in a stateof tranquillity, the proper time for inflicting punish­ment seemed to have arrived. He therefore sent forLucius Marcius from Tarraco, and despatching himwith a third part of the forces to besiege Castulo, hewent himself with the rest of the army against Illi­turgi, where he arrived on the fifth day. The gatesthere had been already shut, and every precautiontaken, and preparation made for repelling an attack;so far had their consciousness of what they meritedserved them instead of a declaration of war.

might be adjusted between them.' Quintius glad ofan opportunity of depriving Philip of that strong­hold, along with the rest, consented to come: accord­ingly, sending a message to Attalus to leave jEgina,and meet him at Sicyon, he set sail from Anticyra withten quinqueremes, which his brother Lucius Quintiushappened to bring a little before from his winter sta­tion at Corcyra, and passed over to Sicyon. Attaluswas there before him, who, representing that the tyrantought to come to the Roman general, not the generalto the tyrant, brought Quintius over to his opinion,which was, that he should not enter the city of Argos.Not far from it, however, was a place called Mycenica;and there the parties agreed to meet. Quintius camewith his brother and a few military tribunes; Attalus,with his royal retinue; and Nicostratus, the pretorof the Achasans, with a few of the auxiliary officers:and they there found Nabis waiting with his wholearmy. He advanced, armed and attended by hisguards, almost to the middle of the interjacent plain;Quintius, unarmed, with his brother and two militarytribunes; the king was accompanied by one of hisnobles, and the pretor of the Achasans, unarmed like­wise. The tyrant, when he saw the king and the Ro­man general unarmed, opened the conference, withapologising for having come to the meeting armed him­self, and surrounded with armed men. 'He had noapprehensions,'he said, 'from them; but only from theArgive exiles.' When they then began to treat of theterms on which friendship was to be established be­tween them, the Roman made two demands: one, thatthe Lacedaemonian should conclude a peace with theAchasans; the other, that he should send him aidagainst Philip. He promised the aid required; but,instead of a peace with the Achaeans, a cessation of hos­tilities was obtained, to last until the war with Philipshould be ended.

But the exigences of war do not wait forthe delays and procrastinations of commanders; andbattles must be sometimes fought, not because com­manders choose it, but because the enemy compels it.The fight itself, and the issue of the fight, is what oughtto be regarded now. The enemy were routed and slain,their camp taken and plundered, the colony relievedfrom a siege, the prisoners taken from the other colonyrecovered and restored to their friends, and an endput to the war in one battle. And not only men re­joiced at this victory, but the immortal gods also hadsupplications paid to them for the space of three days,on account of the business of the state having beenwisely and successfully, not rashly and unfortunately,conducted by Lucius Furius, pretor. Besides, theGallic wars were, by some fatality, destined to theFurian family.'
49. By means of discourses of this kind, made byhim and his friends, the interest of the pretor, whowas present, prevailed over the respect due to thedignity of the absent consul, and the majority decreeda triumph to Lucius Furius. Lucius Furius, pretor,during his office triumphed over the Gauls. He carriedinto the treasury three hundred and twenty thousandasses,i and one hundred and seventy thousand pounds'weight of silver.

He then di­rected all the military tribunes, prefects of the allies,and centurions, to guard the gates carefully, that noone might go out of the city in the night. This wasnot performed with proper care and diligence; for,before the guards were posted at the gates, or nightcame on, seven principal senators made their escapewith their children. At the first light, on the dayfollowing, the senate being summoned into the forum,they were missed, and their property was sold. Fromthe rest of the senators one hundred and twenty hos­tages were received, who were their own children, andthey were delivered to Caius Terentius to be con­ducted to Rome. He represented every thing to thesenate in such a light as greatly increased their suspi­cions; wherefore, as if the hostile intentions of theEtrurians were no longer to be doubted, an order wasgiven to Caius Terentius himself to lead one of thecity legions to Arretium, and to keep it there, as agarrison to the city. It was at the same time deter­mined that Caius Hostilius, with the rest of the troops,should make a circuit through the whole province;that those who wished to excite disturbances mighthave no opportunity of putting their designs in exe­cution. When Caius Terentius, with the legion, ar-^rived at Arretium, and demanded from the magistratesthe keys of the gates, they told him that they werenot to be found; but he believing rather that they hadbeen put out of the way through some evil design,than lost through negligence, put on new locks, mak­ing use of every precaution to keep all things underhis own power. He earnestly cautioned Hostilius notto expect to retain the Etrurians in quiet by any othermeans than by putting it out of their power to stir.

About this time the business of the Tarentinesoccasioned a warm debate in the senate, where Fabiuswas present, exerting himself in favor of those whomhe had subdued by arms, while others spoke of themwith much asperity, charging them as equal in guilt,and deserving equal punishment with the Campanians,

The Boeotians,indeed, and the people of the inland parts of Greece,informed him that, in order to prevent them from pass­ing to the assistance of the allied states, the straits ofThermopylae, where the road is confined, and con­tracted to a very narrow breadth, had been shut up bythe jEtolians with a ditch and a rampart. Sueh anumber of disturbances on all sides were sufficient torouse even an indolent leader: he dismissed the am­bassadors with promises of assisting them all, as timeand circumstances would permit. He sent to Pepare-thus a garrison for the city; a business which requiredthe utmost dispatch, accounts having been receivedfrom thence that Attains had sailed over from Lemnos,and was ravaging all the country round. He de­spatched Polyphantas, with a small number of forces,to Boeotia; and likewise Menippus, one of the officersof his guards, with one thousand targeteers, (the targetis not unlike the common buckler,) to Chalcis. Agria-num was reinforced with five hundred men, that allparts of the island might be secured. He himself wentto Scotussa, ordering the Macedonian troops to bebrought over thither from Larissa. He was there in­formed that the /Etolians had been summoned to anassembly at Heraclea, and that king Attalus was tocome to consult with them on the conduct of the war.Resolving to disturb this meeting by his sudden ap­proach, he led his army by forced marches to Hera­clea, and arrived there just after the assembly hadbeen dismissed. However, he destroyed the crops,which were almost ripe, particularly round the jEnianbay. He then led back his forces to Scotussa, and,leaving there the body of his army, retired with theroyal guards to Demetrias. That he might be in rea­diness to meet every effort of the enemy, he sent peo­ple from hence to Phocis,and Euboea, and Peparethus,to choose out eleyated situations, where fires being

blood flowed from a lake. On account of these por­tents there was a supplication performed of one day'scontinuance. During many successive ones, sacrificeswere offered of victims of the larger kinds, and yet nofavorable omens appeared, nor, for a long time, wasthere any indication of the gods becoming propitious.The baneful events, thus foreboded, affected not im­mediately the safety of the state, but fell on the per­sons of the consuls. The Apollinarian games hadbeen first celebrated by the city pretor, Cornelius Sulla,in the consulate of Quintus Fulvius and Appius Clau­dius; and, thenceforward, all the city pretors in suc­cession had performed them; but they vowed themonly for one year, and fixed no particular day for theirobservance. This year a grievous epidemic disorderfell both on the city and country: however, the sick­ness was rather tedious than mortal. On account ofthis malady, a supplication was performed in all thestreets of Rome, the city pretor, Publius Licinius Va­rus, being at the same time ordered to propose to thepeople to enact a law, that a vow should be made forthe perpetual celebration of those games on a statedday. Accordingly he himself first engaged for it,holding the games on the third day of the nones ofJuly, which day has ever since been observed as ananniversary festival.
24. The rumors concerning the Arretians grewevery day more and more alarming, and greatly in­creased the anxiety of the senate; wherefore orderswere despatched to Caius Hostilius, not to defer takinghostages from that people; and Caius Terenlius Varrowas sent with a commission to receive them from him,and conduct them to Rome. On his arrival, Hosti­lius immediately ordered one legion, which was en­camped before the gates, to march into the city; andthen, having posted guards in proper places, he sum­moned the senate to attend him in the forum, andmake a demand of hostages. The senate requestedtwo days' time to consider the matter; but he insistedthat they should give them instantly, or he would next

ships, heavily laden, a second time, with all kinds ofspoil. From that time laying aside small expeditionsand predatory excursions, he turned the whole forceof the war to the siege of Utica; intending, if heshould take it, to establish his head-quarters there forthe future, in order to the better execution of the restof his designs. While the marine forces made theirapproaches on that side of the city which is washed bythe sea, those of the land advanced from a risingground hanging almost over the walls. Engines andmachines had been sent from Sicily with the stores;and many were made in the armory, where a number ofartificers, skilled in such works, were retained for thepurpose. The people of Utica, attacked on all sides bysuch a powerful force, had no hopes but from the Car­thaginians; nor the Carthaginians any but from Has-drubal, and from him only, as he should be able to in­fluence Syphax. But all measures proceeded too slowlyfor their anxious desire of aid, of which they stood somuch in need. Hasdrubal, though he had, by the mostdiligent press, made up the number of thirty thousandfoot, and three thousand horse, yet durst not move to­wards the camp of the enemy before the arrival of Sy­phax. Syphax soon came with fifty thousand foot, andten thousand horse; and immediately decamping fromCarthage, sat down at a small distance from Utica, andthe intrenchments of the Romans. Their approach pro­duced at least this consequence, that Scipio, after hav­ing besieged Utica for near forty days, and tried everyexpedient for its reduction, in vain, was obliged toretire from it, as the winter was now at hand. Hefortified his winter camp on a promontory, joined tothe continent by a narrow isthmus, and which stretchesout to some length into the sea; and included thenaval camp within the same intrenchment. The le­gions were stationed on the middle of the isthmus;the ships were hauled on shore, and the seamen occu­pied the coast which faces the north; the cavalry avalley on the south. Such were the transactions inAfrica to the latter end of autumu.

10. When the time of the elections arrived, as ithad been determined that they should be held by adictator, the consul Caius Claudius nominated his col­league Marcus Livius to that office. Livius appointedQuintus Caecilius master of the horse. By Marcus Li­vius were elected consuls, Lucius Veturius and Quin­tus Caecilius, who was then master of the horse. Theelection of pretors was next held: there were ap­pointed Caius Servilius, Marcus Caecilius Metellus,Tiberius Claudius Asellus, and Quintus Mamilius Tu-rinus, at that time plebeian edile. When the electionswere finished, the dictator, having laid down his officeand dismissed his army, set out for his province ofEtruria, in pursuance of a decree of the senate, inorder to make inquiries what states of the Tuscans orUmbrians had, on the approach of Hasdrubal, formedschemes of revolting to him from the Romans; or whohad afforded him men, provisions, or any kind of aid.Such were the transactions of that year at home andabroad. The Roman games were thrice repeated bythe curule ediles, Cneius Servilius Caspio and ServiusCornelius Lentulus. The plebeian games also wereonce repeated intire by the plebeian ediles, ManiasPomponius Matho and Quintus Mamilius Thurinus.[A.U. C. 646. B.C. 206.] In the thirteenth year ofthe Punic war, when Lucius Veturius Philo and Quin­tus Cheilius Metellus were consuls, they were bothappointed to the province of Bruttium, to conduct thewar against Hannibal. The pretors then cast lots fortheir provinces: the business of the city fell to Mar­cus Caecilius Metellus; the jurisdiction in relation toforeigners, to Quintus Mamilius; Sicily, to CaiusServilius; and Sardinia, to Tiberius Claudius. Thearmies were thus distributed: to one of the consuls,that which had been under Caius Claudius, the consulof the former year; to the other, that which had been

fatal frensy of the times, wherein, as it were, throughsome pestilent contagion, not only the Illergetians andLacetanians, but even the Roman camp had been in­fected: that the present state of himself, his brother,and the rest of his countrymen, was such, that if it wasrequired they would surrender up to Scipio the lifewhich he had spared to them ; or, if they might be stillpreserved, they would ever devote it to his service;for in such case they should be actually twice indebtedto him alone for existence. That, in the former case,they had confidence in their cause, before they hadmade trial of his clemency; but now, on the contrary,they could have none in their cause, and their onlyhope lay in the mercy of their conqueror.' It was thepractice of the Romans, observed from very earlytimes with respect to persons with whom they hadformed no treaty of friendship or alliance, never toexercise any act of authority over them; for they werenot held as subjects until they had surrendered alltheir property, both sacred and common, had givenhostages, delivered up their arms, and received gar­risons in their towns. On the present occasion, Scipio,after severely reproaching Mandonius, who was pre­sent, and Indibilis, who was absent, said that 'theyhad deservedly been brought to ruin by their ownwicked practices; that they should owe their lives tothe generosity of himself and the Roman people.Farther, he would not even deprive them of theirarms; those were only to be taken as pledges by suchas feared a renewal of war; they should therefore befreely left them; nor should their minds be shackledwith fear. Should they again revolt, he would nottake vengeance on guiltless hostages, but on them­selves; he would inflict no punishment on defencelessenemies, but on those who carried arms. That he leftit to themselves, who had experienced both, to choosethe favor or the resentment of the Romans.' On theseterms Mandonius was dismissed, and they were onlyfined a sum of money for the pay of the troops. Sci­pio, having sent on his lieutenant into Farther Spain,

Let the Roman camppress on the very gates of Carthage, rather than thatwe, a second time, should behold from our walls therampart of that of the enemy. Let Africa, in short,be the seat of the remainder of the war: thither beremoved terror and flight, devastation of lands, revoltof allies, and all the other calamities with which, forfourteen years, we have been afflicted. It is sufficientthat I have delivered my sentiments on those matterswhich affect the state, the dispute in which we are in­volved, and the provinces under consideration: mydiscourse would be tedious and unsuitable to this au­dience, if, as Quintus Fabius has depreciated my ser­vices in Spain, I should, on the other hand, endeavorin like manner to disparage his glory, and extol myown. , I shall do neither, conscript fathers; but youngas I am, I will show that I excel that sage, if in no­thing else, yet certainly in modesty and temperance oflanguage. Such has been my life and conduct, that Ican, in silence, rest perfectly satisfied with that cha­racter which your own judgments have formed of me.'
45. Scipio was heard the less favorably on accountof a rumor which prevailed, that if he did not carrythe point in the senate, of having Africa decreed tohim as his province, he was determined immediatelyto submit the business to public decision. ThereforeQuintus Fulvius, who had been consul four times, andcensor, demanded of the consul, that he should declareopenly in the senate, whether ' he meant to abide bythe determination of the fathers in regard to the pro­vinces, or whether he intended to bring the matter be­fore the people.' Scipio having answered, that hewould act in such a manner as he should deem mostadvantageous to the state, Fulvius replied, ' I did notask the question through ignorance of what you wouldanswer, and what you intended to do. It is thus plainlyseen, that you are rather sounding the senate, thanconsulting them; and have an order ready to be pro­posed to the people, if we do not immediately decree

23. Some exiles driven from Chalcis, by ill treat­ment received from the king's party, brought intelli­gence that the place might be taken without even acontest; for the Macedonians, being under no imme­diate apprehension from an enemy, were straying idlyabout the country; and the townsmen, depending onthe Macedonian garrison, neglected the guard of thecity. Claudius, in consequence of this, set out, andthough he arrived at Sunium early enough to havesailed forward to the entrance of the strait of Euboea,yet fearing that, on doubling the promontory, he mightbe descried by the enemy, he lay by with the fleetuntil night. As soon as it grew dark he began tomove, and favored by a calm, arrived at Chalcis a littlebefore day; and then, approaching the city, on a sidewhere it was thinly inhabited, with a small party ofsoldiers, and by means of scaling ladders, he got pos­session of the nearest tower, and the wall on eachside. Finding in some places the guards asleep, andother parts left without any watch, they advanced tothe more populous parts of the town, and having slainthe sentinels, and broke open a gate, they gave anentrance to the main body of the troops. These im­mediately spread themselves through all parts of thecity, and increased the tumult by setting fire to thebuildings round the forum, by which means both thegranaries belonging to the king, and his armory, witha vast store of machines and engines, were reduced toashes. Then commenced a general slaughter of thosewho fled, as well as of those who made resistance; andafter having either put to the sword or driven out everyone who was of an age fit to bear arms, (Sopater also,the Acarnanian, who commanded the garrison, beingslain,) they first collected all the spoils in the forum,and then carried it on board the ships.

had shut up there were set at liberty. They next pulleddown and mutilated the statues of the king; and then,on a signal being given for a retreat, reimbarked andreturned to Piraus, from whence they had set out. Ifthere had been a sufficient number of Roman soldiersto have kept possession of Chalcis, without strippingAthens of a proper garrison, that city and the com­mand of the Euripus would have been a most importantadvantage at the commencement of the war; for as thepass of Thermopylae is the principal barrier of Greeceby land, so is the strait of the Euripus by sea.
24. Philip was then at Demetrias, and as soon as thenews arrived there of the calamity which had befallenthe city of his allies, although it was too late to carryassistance to those who were already ruined, yet anxi­ous to accomplish what was next to assistance, revenge,he set out instantly with five thousand foot lightlyequipped, and three hundred horse. With a speedalmost equal to that of racing, he hastened to Chalcis,not doubting but that he should be able to surprise theRomans. Finding himself disappointed, and that hiscoming answered no other end than to give him amelancholy view of the smoking ruins of that friendlycity, (so few being left, that they were scarcely suffi­cient to bury those who had fallen by the sword of theenemy,) with the same rapid haste which he had usedin coming, he crossed the Euripus by the bridge, andled his troops through Boeotia to Athens, in hopes thata similar attempt might be attended by a similar issue:and he would have succeeded, had not a scout (one ofthose whom the Greeks call day-runners,i because theyrun through a journey of great length in one day), des­crying from his post of observation the king's army inits march, set out at midnight, and arrived before themat Athens.

A certain peace is better andsafer than a victory in expectation: the former is inyour own disposal, the latter in that of the gods. Risknot, on the chance of one hour, the happy successes ofso many years. When you consider your own strength,recollect at the same time, the chances of war. Armsthere will be on both sides; but, on both sides, thebodies that contend will be but human. Events lesscorrespond to men's expectations in war, than in anyother case whatever. Even supposing that you shouldgain the victory in battle, the proportion of glory whichyou would thereby acquire, in addition to what yonmay now securely enjoy on granting peace, would boby no means commensurate to that which you must lose,should any misfortune happen to you. The chance ofbut a single hour may destroy at once both the honorswhich you have attained, and those for which you hope.In the adjusting of matters, every thing, Publius Scipio,will be in your own power; in the other case, you mustabide by the pleasure of the gods. Formerly, MarcusAtilius, in this same land, would have been celebratedamong the few most extraordinary examples of braveryand success, had he, when possessed of victory, grantedpeace to the request of our fathers; but by setting nobounds to his ambition, by laying no restraint on hispassions; in proportion to the height of glory to whichhe had attained, was his fall dishonorable. Certainlyit is his right who grants peace, not his who sues for it,to prescribe the terms; yet, perhaps, we might not bedeemed altogether inadequate to the estimation of whatdegree of punishment should be inflicted on us.

that ' although the Carthaginians had violated not onlytheir faith pledged in the truce, but also the laws ofnations respecting ambassadors, yet they should meetno treatment from him unbecoming the maxims of theRoman people and his own principles;' and thus dis­missing them, he prepared for war. Hannibal nowdrew nigh the land, when one of the sailors was orderedto climb the mast, and discover what part of the coun­try they were arrived at; and on his saying that theircourse pointed to a ruined sepulchre, the Carthaginian,struck with the ill omen, ordered the pilot to steerpast that place, put in his fleet at Leptis, and theredisembarked his forces.
2C. These were the transactions in Africa duringthat year; those which follow belong to the period inwhich Marcus Servilius Geminus, who was then mas­ter of the horse, and Tiberius Claudius Nero, wereconsuls. However, towards the end of the formeryear deputies arrived from the allied cities of Greece.They complained that their lands were ravaged byPhilip's garrisons; and that their ambassadors, whohad gone into Macedonia to solicit reparation of theirinjuries, had not been admitted to the presence of theking. At the same time, they gave information thatfour thousand soldiers, under the command of Sopater,had gone over to Africa, and were marching to theassistance of the Carthaginians; and that some moneyalso had been sent with them; whereon the senate or­dered that an embassy should be sent to the king, toacquaint him that the senate considered those proceed­ings as contrary to the treaty subsisting between them.Caius Terentius Varro, Caius Mamilius, and MarcusAurelius, were despatched on this business, with anescort of three quinqueremes.

pursuing the enemy, as each could find a passagethrough the heaps of carcases and weapons andstreams of blood, disordered both their battalions andranks. The battalions of the first rank men also, seeingthe line before them in confusion, began to waver;which, as soon as Scipio observed, he instantly ordereda retreat to be sounded for the spearmen, and carryingoff the wounded to the rear, brought up the first rankmen and veterans to the wings, in order that the lineof the spearmen in the centre might be the more se­cure and firm. Thus was a new battle begun, for theyhad now come up to their real antagonists, who wereon an equality with them, both in respect to the kindof arms which they used, of their experience in war,the fame of their exploits, and the greatness both oftheir hopes and dangers. But the Romans had the ad­vantage in number, and also in spirit, as having alreadyrouted the cavalry and the elephants, and, after havingdefeated the first line, engaging now with the second.35. Laelius and Masinissa, who had pursued theflying cavalry to some distance, returning at this cri­tical juncture, fell on the rear of the enemy; and bythis charge effectually routed them. Many were sur­rounded in the field and slain; many, being dispersedin flight through the open country adjoining, wherethe cavalry were intirely masters, perished in variousplaces. Of the Carthaginians and their allies therewere slain on that day above twenty thousand; aboutthe same number were taken, with a hundred andthirty-three military standards, and eleven elephants.Of the conquerors there fell two thousand. Hannibal,escaping during the confusion with a few horsemen,fled to Hadrumetum, having left no effort untried torally his troops before he left the field. Scipio him­self, and all who were skilled in the military art, al­lowed him the merit of having made the disposition ofhis forces with singular judgment; placing the ele­phants in the front, in order that their ungoverned onsetand insupportable violence might put it out of thepower of the Romans to follow their ensigns, and pre­

of Hannibal to sue for peace. These coming underthe stern of the general's ship, holding out the badgesof supplicants, besought and implored the favor andcompassion of Scipio: but they received no other an­swer, than that they should come to Tunes, to whichplace he intended to remove his camp. Then, aftertaking a view of the situation of Carthage, not somuch for the sake of any present use which he in­tended to make of his knowlege of it, as of dispiritingthe enemy, he returned to Utica, and at the same timerecalled Octavius thither. As they advanced towardsTunes, an account was brought that Vermina, son ofSyphax, with a greater number of horse than of foot,was coming to the aid of the Carthaginians. A de­tachment of the army, with all the cavalry, attackingthis body of Numidians on their march, on the firstday of the Saturnalia, routed them without much diffi­culty; and every possibility of flight being cut off bythe surrounding cavalry, fifteen thousand men wereslain, one thousand two hundred taken, together withfifteen hundred horses, and seventy-two militarystandards. The prince himself, with very few attend­ants, made his escape during the tumult. The campwas then pitched near Tunes, in the same place as be­fore, whither thirty ambassadors came from Carthageto Scipio, and the behavior of these was much morecalculated to excite compassion than that of the former,as their distress was still increasing. But, from therecollection of their late perfidy, they were heard withthe less pity. In the council, though all were stimu­lated by just resentment to pursue Carthage to de­struction, yet, when they considered how great an un­dertaking it was, and what a length of time the siegeof a city, so strong and so well fortified, would re­quire, (Scipio himself also being uneasy, under theapprehension of a successor being appointed in hisplace, who might claim the glory of having terminatedthe war, though it had been actually brought to anissue by the labors and dangers of another,) they allbecame inclined to peace.

Italy. Afterwards, on the pretov's assuring them thatServilius would pay no regard to his letter, PubliusSulpicius, being created dictator for the purpose, re­called the consul, by virtue of his superior authority;and then, with Marcus Servilius, master of the horse,he spent the remainder of the year in going round tothe cities which had forfeited their allegiance duringthe war, and examining into the conduct of each.During the continuance of the truce a hundred trans­ports, with stores, under the convoy of twenty ships ofwar, sent from Sardinia by Lentulus, the pretor, ar­rived safe in Africa, without meeting any obstructioneither from the enemy or bad weather. Cneius Octa-vius, who sailed from Sicily with two hundred trans­ports and thirty ships of war, had not the same goodfortune. His voyage was prosperous until he camealmost within sight of Africa, when the wind at firstsubsided into a calm; then springing up heavily fromthe south-west, his ships were dispersed on all sides.He himself, with the ships of war, struggling throughthe opposing waves, with excessive toil to the rowers,made the promontory of Apollo: the transports weremost of them driven to jEgimurus, an island stretch­ing across the mouth of the bay on which Carthagestands, distant from the city about thirty miles; therest towards that part of it where the hot-baths arefound. All this happened within view of Carthage,and occasioned a concourse of people from all parts inthe forum. The magistrates assembled the senate;the multitude in the porch of the senate-house ex­pressed aloud their uneasiness, lest so great a bootyshould be allowed to escape out of their hands. Al­though some objected that their faith was pledged inhaving sued for peace, others in their having agreed toa truce, and which had not yet expired, yet the assem­bly, being composed of nearly ,an equal number of thepopulace as of senators, came to a resolution that Has-drubal should go to jEgimurus with a fleet of fiftysail, and proceed from thence to pick up the scatteredships of the Romans in the several harbors and alongliv. vol. v.

power to give matters a turn towards war, in case heremained in the province, or towards peace, if he wereto be removed. They chose for the meeting a part ofthe sea-shore, in the Malian gulf, near Nicasa. Thi­ther Philip came from Demetrias, with five barks andone ship of war: he was accompanied by some princi­pal Macedonians, and an Acheean exile, named Cycli-ades, a man of considerable note. With the Romangeneral Were king Amynander, Dionysidorus, ambas­sador from king Attalus, Agesimbrotus, commander ofthe Rhodian fleet, Phaeneas, pretor of the jEtolians, andtwo Achaeans, Aristaenus and Xenophon. Attendedby these, the Roman general advanced to the brink ofthe shore, and the king came forward to the prow ofhis vessel, as it lay at anchor; when the former said,'If you will come on the shore we shall converse withgreater ease.' This the king refused; and on Quin-tius asking him, ' Whom do you fear?' With thehaughty spirit of royalty, he replied, 'Fear I havenone, but of the immortal gods; but I have no confi­dence in the faith of those whom I see about you, andleast of all in the Jitolians.'—' That danger,' said theRoman, ' is equal in all cases; when men confer withan enemy, no confidence subsists.'—' But, Titus Quin-tius,' replied the king, 'if treachery be intended, theprizes of perfidy are not equal: Philip and Phwneas.For it will not be so difficult for the jEtolians to findanother pretor, as for the Macedonians to find anotherking in my place/—Silence then ensued.
33. The Roman expected that he who solicited theconference, should open it; and the king thought thathe who was to prescribe, not he who received termsof peace, ought to begin the conference. At lengththe Roman said that ' his discourse should be verysimple; for he would only mention those articles,without which no pacification could be admitted.These were that the king should withdraw his garri­sons from all the cities of Greece. That he shoulddeliver up to the allies of the Roman people the pri­soners and deserters; should restore to the Romans

What had theRoman people merited, when you took away thepower from the tribunes appointed by their commonsuffrage, and conferred it on private men? when, noteven content with having them for magistrates, you, aRoman army, bestowed the badges of your generalson men who never had been possessed of so much as asingle slave? Albius and Atrius dwelt in the general'spavilion, the trumpets sounded by their orders, theword was taken from them, they sat on the tribunal ofPublius Scipio, they were attended by lictors, the waywas cleared for them, the rods and axes were carriedbefore them.

That the consuls shouldmake a valuation of these, and impose on each acre aquit-rent of one as, as an acknowlegement that theland was the property of the public, in order that whenthe people should become able to pay, if any one choserather to have the money than the land, he might re­store it.' The private creditors accepted the termswith joy; and that land was called Trientius and Ta-bulius, because it was given in lieu of the third part oftheir money.

Publius Sulpicius, after making his vows in thecapitol, set out from the city in his robes of war, at­tended by his lictors, and arrived at Brundusium;where, having formed into legions the veteran soldiersof the African army who were willing to follow him,and chosen his number of ships out of the fleet of thelate consul, Cornelius, he set sail, and next day ar­rived in Macedonia. There he was met by ambassa­dors from the Athenians, intreating him to relievetheir city from the siege. Immediately Caius Clau­dius Centho was despatched to Athens, with twentyships of war and a small body of land forces: for itwas not the king himself who carried on the siege ofAthens; he was at that time intently occupied in be­sieging Abydus, after having tried his strength at seaagainst Attalus, and against the Rhodians, withoutliv. vol. v. v

his bands by some of the principal inhabitants, afterthey had first sounded the minds of the populace. Theybad a custom, that, on the first day of assembly, theirpretors, for the omen's sake, should pronounce thenames Jupiter, Apollo, and Hercules; in addition towhich, a rule had been made, that, along with these,they should join the name of king Philip. After theconclusion of the alliance with the Romans the heraldomitted so to honor him; on which a murmur spreadthrough the multitude, and they soon became clamor­ous, calling out for the name of Philip, and insistingthat the respect, due by law, should be paid as be­fore; which at length being complied with, universalapprobation ensued. On the encouragement affordedby this favorable disposition, Philocles was invited,who seized in the night a strong post called Larissa,seated on a hill which overhangs the city, and in whichhe placed a garrison. At the dawn of day, however,and as he was proceeding in order of battle to theforum, at the foot of the hill he was met by a line oftroops, drawn up to oppose him. This was a body ofAchaeans, lately posted there, consisting of about fivehundred young men, selected out of all the states.Their commander was iEnesidemus, of Dymae. Theking's general sent a person to recommend to them toevacuate the city, because they were not a match forthe townsmen alone, who favored the cause of Philip;much less when these were joined by the Macedonians,whom even the Romans had not withstood at Corinth.This at first had no effect, either on the commander, orhis men: and when they, soon after, perceived the Ar-gives also in arms, coming, in a great body, from theopposite side, and threatening them with destruction,they yet seemed determined to run every hazard, iftheir leader would persevere. But jEnesidemus, un­willing that the flower of the Achasan youth should belost, together with the city, made terms with Phi­locles, that they should have liberty to retire, whilehimself remained armed with a few of his dependents,and without even stirring from his station, To a per-liv. vol. v. 2 b

With these and the other booty he sentNicias, pretor to the Achaeans, to ^Egium; and goingto Corinth, he ordered his army to march by landthrough Bosotia, while he himself, sailing from Cen-chrea, along the coast of Attica, round the promontoryof Sunium, reached Chalcis, after passing almostthrough the middle of the enemy's fleet. Havinghighly commended the fidelity and bravery of the in­habitants, in not suffering either fear or hope to in­fluence their minds, and having exhorted them to per­severe in maintaining the alliance with the same con­stancy, if they preferred their present situation tothat of the inhabitants of Oreum and Opus, he sailedto Oreum; and having there conferred the directionof affairs, and the command of the city, on such of thechief inhabitants as had chosen to fly rather than sur­render to the Romans, he sailed over from Euboea toDemetrias, from whence he had at first set out toassist his allies. Soou after, he laid the keels of onehundred ships of war at Cassandria, collecting a greatnumber of ship-carpenters to finish the work; and, asthe seasonable assistance which he had afforded hisallies in their distress, and the departure of Attalns,bad restored tranquillity in the affairs of Greece, hewithdrew into his own kingdom with an intention ofmaking war on the Dardanians.
9. Towards the end of the summer, during whichthese transactions passed in Greece, Quintus Fabius,son of Maximus, who served as lieutenant-general,brought a message from Marcus Livius, the consul, tothe senate at Rome, in which he gave it as his opinionthat Lucius Porcius with his legions was sufficient tosecure the province of Gaul, and that he himselfmight depart thence, and the consular army be with­drawn. On which the senate ordered not only Mar­cus Livius, but his colleague also, Caius Claudius, toreturn to the city.

proposed to our consideration) the speeches of the am­bassadors delivered yesterday; supposing, for a mo­ment, the speakers not to have required what was use­ful to themselves, but to have recommended what theythought most conducive to our advantage. The Ro­mans, the Rhodians, and Attalus, request an allianceand friendship with us; and they demand to be assistedin the war which they are now engaged in againstPhilip. Philip reminds us of our league with him,and of the obligation of our oath: he requires onlythat we declare ourselves on his side; and says hewill be satisfied if we do not intermeddle in the opera­tions of the war. Who is there so short-sighted as notto perceive the reason why those, who are not yet ourallies, require more than he who is? This arises notfrom modesty in Philip, nor from the want of it in theRomans. The Achaean harbors show what it is, which,while it bestows confidence to requisitions on one side,precludes it on the other. We see nothing belongingto Philip but his ambassador: the Roman fleet lies atCenchrea, exhibiting to our view the spoils of the ci­ties of Eubosa. We behold the consul and his legions,at the distance of a small tract of sea, overrunningPhocis and Locris. You were surprised at Philip'sambassador, Cleomedon, showing such diffidence yes­terday in his application to us to take arms on the sideof the king against the Romans. But if we, in pursu­ance of the same treaty and oath, the obligation ofwhich he inculcated on us, were to ask of him thatPhilip should protect us, both from Nabis and his La­cedaemonians, and also from the Romans, he would beutterly unable to find, not only a force for the purpose,but even an answer to return. As much so, in truth,as was Philip himself, who endeavored, by promises ofwaging war against Nabis, to draw away our youthinto Euboea: but finding that we would neither decreesuch assistance to him, nor choose to be embroiled withRome, forgot that alliance on which he now lays suchstress, and left us to the Lacedaemonians to be spoiledand plundered.

valry were driven within their works, whither theytied in Confusion, pressed almost to the very gates.The action of that day having only whetted their ardorfor a contest, the Romans pitched their camp. Has-drubal, during the night, drew back his army to a hill,the summit of which was spread out into a level plain;on the Tear of the hill was a river, and on the front andon either side it was encircled by a kind of steep bank:at some distance below this lay another plain, slopingdownwards, the circumference of which was likewisebounded by another bank of equally difficult ascent.Into this lower plain Hasdrubal, next day, on seeingthe enemy's line formed in front of their camp, sentdown his Numidian cavalry and the light-armed Ba-learians and Africans. Scipio, riding round the com­panies and battalions, desired them to observe that'the enemy, renouncing at once all hopes of beingable to oppose them on plain ground, endeavored tosecure themselves on hills; waiting within sight, andconfiding in the strength of their posts, not in theirvalor and their arms. But Roman soldiers had mountedthe higher defences of Carthage. Neither hills, nor acitadel, nor the sea itself, had stopped the progress oftheir arms. Those heights which the enemy had seizedwould answer no other purpose than that of compellingthem, in their flight, to leap down crags and preci­pices; but he would prevent their escaping even inthat way.' Accordingly he gave orders to two co­horts, that one of them should secure the entrance ofthe valley through which the river ran; and that theother should block up the road, which led from thecity into the country, across the declivity of the hill.He then put himself at the head of the light troops,which had the day before beaten the enemy's advancedguards, and led them against the light-armed forcesposted on the brink of the lower descent. For sometime they proceeded over rough ground, without meet­ing any other obstacle than the difficulty of the way;afterwards, when they came within reach, vast quanti­ties of weapons of every sort were poured down on

ground in various places, leaving the standards thinlyattended. Hasdrubal, until daylight should discovera road, ordered the army to proceed along the bank ofthe river; and as he wandered along the turnings andwindings, with which that river remarkably abounds,he made but little progress; still intending, however,to cross it, as soon as the day enabled him to find aconvenient passage. But the farther he removed fromthe sea the higher did he find the banks; so that notmeeting with a ford, and wasting the day in the search,he gave the enemy time to overtake him.
48. First, Nero, with all the cavalry, came up; thenPorcius, with the light infantry. While they harassedhis wearied army by frequent assaults on every side, andwhile the Carthaginian, now stopping his march, orrather flight, had a mind to encamp on a high spot ofground, on the bank of the river, Livius arrived with themain body of infantry armed, and marshalled for imme­diate action. When the Romans had united all theirforces, and the line was drawn out in array, Claudiustook the command of the right wing, Livius of the left;that of the centre was given to the pretor. Hasdrubal,laying aside the design of fortifying a camp, when hesaw the necessity of fighting, placed his elephants infront, before the battalions, and, beside them, on theleft wing, he opposed the Gauls to Claudius; not thathe had much confidence in them, but thinking thatthey were much dreaded by the enemy. The right- wing, which was to oppose Livius, he took to himself,together with the Spaniards; on whom, as being vete­ran troops, he placed his principal reliance. The Li-gurians were posted in the centre, behind the elephants;but the line was too long in proportion to its depth.A rising ground in their front protected the Gauls;and while that part of the line which was composed ofthe Spaniards engaged the left wing of the Romans,their right wing stretching out beyond the extent ofthe fight, stood idle; for the eminence between themand the enemy prevented their making an attack eitheron their front or flank.

They were ordered also toacquaint him, that 'the Romans had entered into awar against Philip, because he had given aid to theCarthaginians, while, by the injuries which he ofFeredto the allies of the Roman people, he had obliged themto send fleets and armies into Greece, at a time whenthe flames of war spread over all Italy; and that bythus making them separate their forces, had been theprincipal cause of their beirfg so late in passing over toAfrica: and to request him to send some Numidianhorsemen to assist in that war.' Ample presents weregiven them to be carried to the king; vases of goldand silver, a purple robe, and a tunic adorned withpalms of purple, an ivory sceptre, and a robe of state,with a curule chair. They were also directed to as­sure him, that if he deemed any thing farther requisiteto confirm and enlarge his kingdom, the Roman peo­ple, in return for his good services, would exert theirutmost zeal to effect it. At this time, too, the senatewas addressed by ambassadors from Vermina, son ofSyphax, apologising for his mistaken conduct, on ac­count of his youth and want of judgment, and throwingall the blame on the deceitful policy of the Carthagi­nians: adding, that as Masinissa had from an enemybecome a friend to the Romans, so Vermina wouldalso use his best endeavors that he should not be out­done in offices of friendship to the Roman people, eitherby Masinissa or by any other; and requesting that hemight receive from the senate the title of king, friend,and ally.' The answer given to these ambassadorswas, that 'not only his father Syphax, from a friendand ally, had on a sudden, without any reason, becomean enemy to the Roman people, but that he himselfhad made his first essay of manhood in bearing armsagainst them.

Forty-three horse­men fell in the fight and pursuit, and eighteen weremade prisoners. The troops in camp had taken thealarm, and were going fo succor the consuls, whenthey saw one consul, and the other consul's son, bothwounded, and the small remains of the unfortunateparty on their return. The death of Marcellus, un­happy in other respects, was no less so in this, that byconduct, ill becoming either bis age (for he was nowabove sixty years old), or the prudence of a veterancommander, he had so improvidently precipitatedhimself, bis colleague, and, in some measure, thewhole commonwealth, into such desperate hazard. Ishould engage in too many and too long discussions ona single event, if I were to recite all the various rela­tions given by different writers of the death of Mar­cellus. To omit other authors, Lucius Caslius pre­sents us with three different narratives of that occur­rence; one received by tradition: another written andcontained in the funeral panegyric, delivered by hisson, who was present in the action ; and a third, whichhe produces as the real state of the fact, discovered bybis own inquiries. But how much soever reports vary,most of them, notwithstanding, concur in stating thathe went out of his camp to view the ground, and all,that be was slain in an ambuscade.

Hannibal, supposing that the enemy must begreatly dismayed by the death of one of their consuls,and the wounds of the other, and wishing not to loseany advantage which a juncture so favorable mightafford, removed his camp immediately to the hill onwhich the battle had been fought. Here he found thebody of Marcellus, and interred it.

condly, in assisting their enemies with troops andmoney. That Publius Scipio had acted and was act­ing properly and regularly, in treating as foes, andthrowing into confinement, those who were taken inarms against the Roman people; and that Marcus Au-relius did his duty to the state, and in a manner agree­able to the senate, in protecting the allies of the Ro­man people by arms, since he could not do it by theauthority of the treaty.' The Macedonians being dis­missed with this severe answer, the Carthaginian am­bassadors were called; on sight of whose ages anddignities, every one was ready to observe that theywere now in earnest in their application for peace, forthat these were by far the most respectable persons oftheir nation. Hasdrnbal (by his countrymen surnamedHaedus) was distinguished above the rest, havingalways recommended peace, and opposed the Barcinefaction. On that account great attention was paid tohim, when he transferred the blame of the war fromthe state on the ambition of a few. After discoursingon various heads, at one time refuting charges whichhad been made against them; at another, acknow-leging some, lest, by denying what was manifestlytrue, he might render forgiveness more difficult; andthen going so far as to admonish the conscript fathersto show mildness and moderation in prosperity, headded, that 'if the Carthaginians had listened to himand Hanno, and made a proper use of occurrences asthey happened, they would have been in a condition ofprescribing terms, instead of begging a peace, as theynow did: but men were seldom blessed with good for­tune and a good understanding at the same time.That the Roman people were therefore invincible, be­cause, when successful, they never lost sight of themaxims of wisdom and prudence; and indeed, itwould have been surprising had they acted other­wise: while those who are unaccustomed to success,unable to restrain their transports, run into extrava­gance.

15. Of the cities of Thessaly, the first which he at­tacked was Phaleria. The garrison here consisted oftwo thousand Macedonians, who made at first a mostvigorous resistance, availing themselves, to the utmost,of every advantage that their arms and works couldafford. The assault was carried on without intermis­sion or relaxation, either by day or by night, becausethe consul thought that it would have a powerfuleffect on the spirits of the rest of the Thessalians, ifthe first who made trial of the Roman strength wereunable to withstand it; and this at the same time sub­dued the obstinacy of the Macedonians. On the re­duction of Phaleria, deputies came from Metropolisand Piera, surrendering those cities. To them, on theirpetition, pardon was granted: Phaleria was sacked,and burned. He then proceeded to yEginium; butfinding this place so circumstanced that, even with amoderate garrison, it was safe, after discharging a fewweapons against the nearest advanced guard, he di­rected his march towards the territory of Gomphi;and thence, into the plains of Thessaly. His armywas now in want of every thing, because he had sparedthe lands of the Epirots; he therefore despatched mes­sengers to learn whether the transports had reachedLeucas and the Ambracian bay; sending the cohorts,in turn, to Ambracia for corn. Now the road fromGomphi to Ambracia, although difficult and embar­rassed, is very short: so that in a few days provisionswere brought up from the sea in abundance.

and spared the towns as far as they were able, in orderto possess the more opulent empire. For, what sortof conduct was it to destroy the objects, for the posses­sion of which the contest was waged, and therebyleave nothing to himself but fighting? Philip had, inthe last year, desolated more cities of his allies inThessaly than all the enemies that Thessaly ever had.On the jEtolians themselves he had made greater de­predations, when he was in alliance with them, thansince he became their enemy. He had seized on Ly-simachia, after dislodging the pretor and garrison ofthe jEtolians. Cius also, a city belonging to theirgovernment, he rased from the foundation. With thesame injustice, he held possession of Thebes in Phthi-otis, of Echinus, Larissa, and Pharsalus.'
84. Philip, provoked by this discourse of Alexander,pushed his ship nearer to the land, that he might bethe better heard, and began to speak with much vio­lence, particularly against the jEtolians. But Phameas,interrupting him, said that 'the business depended noton words; he must either conquer in war, or submit tohis superiors.'—' That, indeed, is evident,' said Philip,'even to the blind,' sneering at Phaeneas, who had adisorder in his eyes; for he was naturally fonder ofsuch pleasantries than became a king; and even in themidst of serious business, he indulged a turn to ridiculefarther than was decent.

Why do you not rather, since you haveleisure to recount Grecian fables, mention Agathocles,king of Syracuse, who, when Sicily was for a longtime wasted by a Punic war, by passing over into thissame Africa, averted that war to the place from whenceit came?

' But what need is there either of ancient orforeign examples to remind us how useful it is tospread terror among the enemy by a sudden attack;and after removing the danger to a distance from our­selves, to make him abide the hazard? Can there beany greater or more striking instance than is found inHannibal? Between wasting the territories of others,and seeing our own destroyed with fire and sword, thedifference is immense. The assailant has ever morespirit than the defendant; and people's apprehensionsare the greater in the latter case. When you haveentered an enemy's territories, you can then see moredistinctly the advantages and disadvantages which per­tain to the same. Hannibal never entertained a hopethat so many nations in Italy would revolt to him asdid, and which was induced by our misfortune atCannEB.

These setout as commanded, carrying scaling ladders fitted tothe height of the citadel, according to their informa­tion, and about midnight they gave the signal from theplace appointed, to those who were to betray thatfortress. These were prepared, and on the watch ; andletting down from their side machines made for thepurpose, received the Romans as they climbed up inseveral places at once. They then fell on the Cartha­ginian sentinels, who, not apprehending any danger,were fast asleep; their dying groans were the firstsound heard. A sudden consternation followed as theremainder awoke, with a general confusion from beingwholly ignorant of the cause of alarm. At length, thegreater part of them being roused from sleep, the truthwas discovered. And now every one called loudly toarms; that the enemy were in the citadel; that thesentinels were slain. The Romans, being much in­ferior in number, would certainly have been over­powered, had not a shout, raised by those who were atthe outside of the citadel, prevented the garrison fromdiscerning on what side the danger threatened, whilethe darkness of the night aggravated every fear. TheCarthaginians, supposing that the citadel had been sur­prised and taken, without attempting a contest, fled toanother fortress not far distant from this. The inhabi­tants held the city which lay between these strong­holds as a prize for the conquerors, slight engagementshappening every day.

Mago went to Gades in the shipswhich had been sent back by Hasdrubal. Of the rest,thus abandoned by their generals, some deserted,others fled and dispersed through the neighboringstates; no detachment remaining, considerable eitherfor number or strength. These were the principalevents, in consequence of which, under the conductand auspices of Publius Scipio, the Carthaginianswere compelled to relinquish all footing in Spain, inthe thirteenth year from the commencement of hostili­ties, the fifth from Scipio's having received the com­mand of the province and of the army. Not longafter, Silanus returned to Scipio at Tarraco, with in­formation that the war was at an end.
17. Lucius Scipio was employed in conveying toRome a great many prisoners of distinction, and incarrying the news of the reduction of Spain. Whilethis was considered by all others as a most joyful andglorious event, he alone, by whose means it had beenaccomplished, insatiable in his pursuit of glory, con­sidered it as a trifle in comparison with those designswhich his aspiring mind and sanguine hopes promptedhim to conceive. He now directed his views to Africa,regarding the subjugation of Carthage, in all hergrandeur, as the consummation of his renown. Deem­ing it necessary, therefore, to conciliate the friendshipof the several African kings and people, he resolved tomake the first trial of Syphax, king of the Massaesy-lians,—a nation bordering on Mauritania, and lyingopposite to that part of Spain, particularly where NewCarthage stands. There was an alliance at that timesubsisting between this monarch and the Carthaginians.Supposing him, however, not more firmly attached thanbarbarians usually are, whose fidelity always dependson fortune, Scipio despatched Laelius to him as envoy,with proper presents.

That he might not, however, seem tohave turned back as in flight, he encamped on the spotwhere he had halted, about five miles from the city;and, after staying there a few days, retreated to Me-tapontum. Prom hence he sent to Tarentum two Me-tapontines, with letters from the principal men in thatstate to Fabius, to receive his promise of impunity forwhat was past, on condition of their delivering Meta-pontum and the Carthaginian garrison into his hands.Fabius, supposing the offer to be made with sincerity,appointed a day on which he would come to Metapon-tum, and gave letters in answer, which were deliveredto Hannibal, who, overjoyed at the success of his stra­tagem, and at finding that even Fabius was not proofagainst artifice, formed an ambuscade at a small dis­tance from Metapontum. As Fabius was taking theauspices, previous to his departure from Tarentum,the birds repeatedly refused the favorable signs; also,when he consulted the gods by sacrifice, the aruspexwarned him to beware of treachery and plots.

heard that, hefore his arrival, the Boians had made in­roads on the territories of the allies, levied two occa­sional legions on account of this disturbance; and add­ing to them four cohorts from his own army, orderedCaius Oppius, the prefect, to march with this tumult­uary band through Umbria (which is called the Sap-pinian district), and to invade the territories of theBoians; leading his own troops thither openly, overthe mountains which lay in the way. Oppius, on en­tering the same, for some time committed depredationswith good success and safety. But afterwards, havingpitched on a place near a fort called Mutilum, conve­nient enough for cutting down the corn which wasnow ripe, and setting out, without having acquired aknowlege of the country, and without establishingarmed posts of sufficient strength to protect those whowere unarmed and intent on their work, he was suddenlysurrounded, together with his foragers, and attackedby the Gauls. On this, even those who were furnishedwith weapons, struck with dismay, betook themselvesto flight. Seven thousand men, dispersed throughthe corn fields, were put to the sword, among whomwas the commander himself, Caius Oppius. The restwere driven in confusion into the camp; from whence,in consequence of a resolution there formed, they setout on the following night, without any particularcommander; and, leaving behind a great part of theirbaggage, made their way through woods almost impas­sable to the consul, who returned to Rome withouthaving performed any thing in his province worth no­tice, except that he ravaged the lands of the Boians,and made a treaty with the Ingaunian Ligurians.

Meanwhile, both hope and anxiety daily in­creased in equal proportion; nor could people judgewith certainty whether it was a proper subject of re­joicing that Hannibal had, at the end of sixteen years,departed from Italy, and thereby left the possession ofit open to the Roman people, or whether they had notrather cause of fear in his having carried his army safeinto Africa. They considered that, although the placewas 'changed, the danger was still the same: thatQuintus Fabius, lately deceased, who foretold the vio­lence of this struggle, had grounds for what he fartherpresaged, namely, that Hannibal would prove a moreformidable enemy in his own country than he had beenin a foreign one. Scipio,' he said, ' would not have todeal with Syphax, a king of undisciplined barbarians,whose army had been sometimes commanded by Stato-rius, a man but little elevated above the condition of aslave; nor with such a dastardly general as his father-in-law Hasdrubal; nor with tumultuary armies, has­tily collected out of a crowd of armed rustics,—butwith Hannibal, a general of the greatest bravery;brought up from his infancy in the midst of arms; inhis childhood a soldier; when scarcely arrived at theage of youth, a general: who had advanced to an oldage through a course of victories: had filled Spain,Gaul, and Italy, from the Alps to the strait, with mo­numents of his mighty achievements; who was at thehead of an army equally experienced in service withhimself, hardened by having gone through every kindof difficulty, even beyond what men could be supposedto endure; which had been stained, numberless times,with Roman blood, and had carried with them thespoils, not only of Roman soldiers, but of Roman com­manders: that many would meet Scipio in battle who,with their own hands, had slain pretors, generals, andconsuls; who, in fine, were decorated with the highestmilitary honors, accustomed as they were to ravagecamps and the cities of Italy; and that the magistrates

Lucius Arennius, interposed. They asserted that' there-electing of the same person to the supreme magis­tracy was not easily reconcilable to the principles of arepublic; and much more pernicious would the pre­cedent be, if the very person who presided at the elec­tion were himself to be chosen. If therefore the dic­tator admitted his own name in the list of candidates,they would protest against the election; but if he re­ceived on the list any other except himself, they wouldgive no obstruction to the business.' The dictatormaintained the propriety of the proceedings of the as­sembly, on the grounds of a vote of the senate, anorder of the people, and several precedents: for ' inthe consulate of Cneius Servilius, wheu the other con­sul Cains Flaminius had fallen at the Thrasymenus,the question was, by direction of the senate, proposedto the people, and the people ordered that so long asthe war continued in Italy it should be lawful forthem to re-elect to the consulship, and that as often asthey should see proper, any of those who had alreadyheld that office. As to precedents in point, he had oneof ancient date, in the case of Lucius Postumius Me-gellus, who, while be was interrex, was, in the assem­bly where he himself presided, created consul, withCaius Junius Bubulcus; and a recent one, in the caseof Quintus Fabius, who certainly would never havesuffered himself to be re-elected if it were inconsistentwith the public good.' After long dispute, maintainedby these arguments, an agreement at last took placebetween the dictator and the tribunes to abide by thedetermination of the senate. The senators were ofopinion that the present state of the commonwealthwas such as required that the administration of itsaffairs should be in the hands of experienced com­manders, skilled in all the arts of war; and theytherefore disapproved of any opposition to the pro­ceedings of the assembly of election.

without coming to any resolution, he said, ' that there­in he acted most prudently for the interest of the state;for the jEtolians would have it in their power to joinin alliance with whichever of the parties should bemore successful in the war.' Nothing farther was donein the assembly.
33. Meanwhile Philip was making vigorous prepa­rations for carrying on the war both by sea and land.His naval forces he drew together at Demetrias inThessaly; supposing that Attalus, and the Romanfleet, would move from jEgina in the beginning of thespring. He gave the command of the fleet and of thesea-coast to Heraclides, to whom he had formerly in­trusted it. The equipment of the land-forces he tookcare of in person; and thought that he had deprivedthe Romans of two powerful auxiliaries, the jEtolianson the one side, and the Dardanians on the other, bymaking his son Perseus block up the pass at Pela-gonia. The consul was employed, not in preparations,but in the operations of war. He led his army throughthe country of the Dassaretians, leaving the corn un­touched which he had brought from his winter quar­ters, for the fields afforded supplies sufficient for theconsumption of the troops. The towns and villagessurrendered to him, some through inclination, othersthrough fear; some were taken by assault, otherswere found deserted, the barbarians flying to theneighboring mountains. He fixed a standing camp atLycus near the river Beous, and from thence sent tobring in corn from the magazines of the Dassaretians.Philip saw the whole country filled with consternation,and not knowing the designs of the consul, he sent aparty of horse to discover his route. Sulpicius was inthe same state of uncertainty; he knew that the kinghad moved from his winter quarters, but in what di­rection he had proceeded, he knew not: he also hadsent horsemen to gain intelligence. These two par­ties having set out from opposite quarters, after wan­dering a long time among the Dassaretians, throughunknown roads, fell at length into the same road.

22. While Scipio was thus employed, operationswere carried on by his lieutenant Marcius, who, hav­ing passed the river Baetis, which the natives call Cer-tis, got possession of two wealthy cities, by surrenderwithout a contest. There was another called Astapa,which had always taken part with the Carthaginians;but that circumstance did not so much call for resent­ment, as from their having acted towards the Romanswith an extraordinary degree of animosity, beyondwhat the exigences of the war could warrant. Thiswas the more surprising, as they had no city so se­cured, either by situation or fortification, as that itmight encourage such fierceness of temper; but thedisposition of the inhabitants delighting in plunder,led them to make incursions into the neighboringlands belonging to the allies of the Roman people, andeven to seize on small parties of soldiers, together withthe sutlers and traders. A large detachment also,which was attempting to pass through their territory,was surrounded by an ambuscade, and put to death ina place where they could not defend themselves. Assoon as the army approached to besiege the city, theinhabitants, conscious of their crimes, saw no prospectof safety in surrendering to a people so highly pro­voked; and as their fortifications were in such a statethat they could not greatly hope to defend themselvesby arms, they contrived a plan of the most shockingand savage nature, which they agreed to execute onthemselves and their families. They fixed on a partof the forum, into which they brought together all theirmost valuable effects, and having made their wivesand children seat themselves on this heap, they piledup timber all round it, and threw on it abundance offaggots.

The confusion occasioned by these was in­creased by the shouts of the legions; nor would theCarthaginian line have stood their ground, bad notMago immediately brought up the elephants to thefight, having kept them in readiness against thefirst motion which the horse should make. By thesnorting and sight of these animals, the horses werefrightened to such a degree, as rendered the aid of thecavalry of no effect. As the Roman horseman had theadvantage in point of strength, when in close fight,and when he could use his javelin and sword hand tohand; so the Numidian had the better in darting jave­lins at him from a distance, and when his horse's frightwould not suffer him to advance. Among the infan­try, the twelfth legion having lost the greater part oftheir number, kept their ground, rather through shame,than that they had strength to maintain it. Theymust soon however have fallen back, had not the thir­teenth legion, led up from the reserve to the front,supported the doubtful conflict. Mago at the sametime brought up to oppose this fresh legion the Gauls,drawn also from his reserve. These being routedwithout much difficulty, the spearmen of the eleventhlegion formed themselves into a circular body, and at­tacked the elephants, which were now throwing theline of the infantry into confusion; and by dischargingtheir spears at them, hardly any of which were thrownin vain, as the beasts were close together they turnedthem all on the line of their own party. Four of them,overpowered with wounds, fell. On this the first line ofthe enemy began to give way; when all the infantry,seeing the elephants turning about, rushed on in orderto increase the terror and confusion. As long how­ever as Mago stood at the head of the troops, theranks, retreating leisurely, kept up the spirit of thebattle; but when they saw him fall on receiving awound through his thigh, and carried lifeless out ofthe field, instantly all betook themselves to flight.

also made of an affinity to be contracted between them,by the king marrying Hasdrubal's daughter. Hasdru-bal had gone with a design of completing this business,and fixing a time for the nuptials, the damsel beingnow marriageable; and finding him inflamed withlove (for the Nnmidians are, beyond all other barba­rians, inclined to amorous pleasures), he sent for herfrom Carthage, and hastened the wedding. Amongother instances of mutual regard and affection, and inorder that their private connexion might be cementedby a public one, an alliance between the king and thepeople of Carthage was ratified by oath, and their faithreciprocally pledged that they would have the samefriends and enemies. But Hasdrubal remembered thatthe king had previously entered into a league withScipio, and knowing how unsteady and changeablewere the minds of the barbarians, he dreaded lest, ifScipio once came into Africa, that match might provea slender tie; he therefore seized the opportunitywhile the warmth of the Numidian's new passion wasat the highest, and calling to his aid the blandishmentsof his daughter, prevailed on him to send ambassadorsinto Sicily to Scipio, and by them to warn him, 'notto be induced, by a reliance on his former promises, topass over into Africa, for that he was now united tothe people of Carthage, both by his marriage with acitizen of that state, daughter of Hasdrubal, whom hehad seen entertained in his house, and also by a publictreaty. He recommended it strongly to the Romansto carry on the war against the Carthaginians, at a dis­tance from Africa, as they had hitherto done, lest hemight be under a necessity of interfering in theirdisputes, and of joining one or the other, while hewished to decline taking part with either. If Scipioshould enter Africa, and advance his army towardsCarthage, he must then of necessity fight, as well indefence of the country wherein he himself was born,as in support of the native city of his spouse, herparent, and household gods.'24.

On occasion of these illomens a supplication of one day's continuance wasperformed; the consuls employed themselves diligentlyin the worship of the gods, and as soon as these wereappeased set out for their provinces. jElius, accom­panied by Caius Helvius, pretor, went into Gaul,where he put under the command of the pretor thearmy which he received from Lucius Lentnlus, and,which he ought to have disbanded, intending to carryon his own operations with the new troops which hehad brought with him; but he effected nothing worthrecording. The other consul, Titus Quintins, settingsail from Brundusium earlier than had been usual withformer consuls, reached Corcyra, with eight thousandfoot and eight hundred horse. From this place hepassed over, in a quinquereme, to the nearest part ofEpirus, and proceeded by long journeys to the Romancamp. Here he dismissed Villius; and waiting a fewdays, until the forces from Corcyra should come upand join him, held a council, to determine whether heshould endeavor to force his way straight forwardthrough the camp of the enemy; or whether, withoutattempting an enterprise of so great difficulty and dan­ger, he should not rather take a circuitous and saferoad, so as to penetrate into Macedonia by the countryof the Dassaretians and Lycus. The latter plan would,have been adopted had he not feared that, in removingto a greater distance from the sea, the enemy mightslip out of his hands; and that if the king should re­solve to secure himself in the woods and wilds, as hehad done before, the summer might be spun out with­out any thing being effected. It was therefore deter­mined, be the event what it might, to attack the enemyin their present post, disadvantageous as it would seemto an assailant. But it was easier to resolve on thismeasure than to devise any safe or certain method ofaccomplishing it.

my, or to let the year pass without consuls. It wasjudged most advisable, though the other consul Vale­rius was abroad, that he should rather be recalled,and even from Sicily. Accordingly, in pursuance ofan order of the senate, a letter was sent to him by Lu­cius Manlius, pretor of the city, and together with itthat of the consul Marcellus, that from them he mightperceive the reason which induced the senate to re­call him from his province, rather than his colleague.About this time ambassadors came to Rome from kingSyphax, with a recital of all the successful battleswhich he had fought against the Carthaginians, andassurances that' their king entertained not a more in­veterate enmity to any nation than to the Carthagi­nian, nor a more warm friendship for any than for theRoman;' adding, that 'he had before sent embassiesinto Spain, to the Roman generals, Cneius and Pub-lius Cornelius; and that he now wished to seek, asit were, at the fountain head, the friendship of theRomans.' The senate not only answered his ambas­sadors with kindness, but sent others in return, chargedwith presents to the king; these were Lucius Genucius,Publius Postelius, and Publius Popilius. The presentswhich they carried were, a purple gown and vest, anivory chair, and a golden bowl of five pounds weight.They received orders also to proceed to visit other chief­tains of Africa, carrying with them donatives of gownswith purple borders, and golden bowls weighing threepounds each. To Alexandria, also, were sent MarcusAtilius, and Manius Acilius, in embassy to king Pto­lemy Philopater and queen Cleopatra, to revive andrenew the former treaty of friendship; bearing withthem a purple gown and vest, with an ivory chair forthe king; an embroidered gown and a purple robe forthe queen.

The contest betweenthe censors, thus mutually reproaching each other,was shameful; while the rebuke given to the giddi­ness of the people was highly becoming a censor, andthe strict principles of that age. The censors havingfallen into disrepute, Cneius Baebius, tribune of thepeople, thinking that their situation afforded him anopportunity of gaining notice, summoned them both toa trial before the people; but the senate interfered,and stopped any farther proceedings, lest the office afcensor should in future be subjected to the humor ofthe populace.
38. During the same summer the consul took Clam-petia in Bruttium by storm. Consentia and Pandosia,with other towns of small consequence, surrenderedvoluntarily; and, as the time of the elections drewnear, it was thought more expedient to call home Cor­nelius from Etruria, where there was no employmentfor his arms. He elected Cneius Servilius Caapio andCneius Servilius Geminus. The election of the pre-tors was then held: there were chosen Cneius Corne­lius Lentulus, Publius Quintilius Varus, PubliusjElius Partus, and Publius Villius Tappulus; al­though the two latter were ediles of the commons.The consul, as soon as the elections were over, returnedinto Etruria to his army. The priests who died thatyear, and those who were substituted in the places ofothers, were Tiberius Veturius Philo, flamen of Mars,elected and inaugurated in the room of Marcus JEmi-lius Regillus, deceased the year before.

Scipio, asking him 'who, and of what country he was;and why, at that early age, he had been found in acamp V he told him that 'he was a Numidian, calledby his countrymen Massiva; that being left an orphan,by the death of his father, he was educated in the fa­mily of his maternal grandfather, Gala, king of Numi-dia: that he had come over into Spain with his uncleMasiuissa, who had lately brought a body of cavalryto the assistance of the Carthaginians: that he hadnever before been in a battle, having been prohibitedby Masinissa on account of his youth; but that, on theday of the engagement with the Romans, he had pri­vately taken a horse and arms, and, unknown to hisuncle, gone out into the field, whereby his horse fall­ing he was thrown to the ground, and made a prisonerby the Romans.' Scipio, ordering the boy to be takencare of, finished what business was to be done at thetribunal; then, retiring into his pavilion, he called theyouth, and asked him whether he wished to return toMasinissa? To which the other, his eyes suffusedwith tears of joy, replied, that above all things it waswhat he wished. He then gave as presents to him agold ring, a vest with a broad purple border, a Spanishcloak with a golden clasp, likewise a horse fully ac­coutred; and, ordering a party of horsemen to escorthim as far as he chose, sent him away.
20. He then held a council, to settle a plan of opera­tions; when many advised him, without delay, to go inpursuit of Hasdrubal: but such a step he thought toohazardous, lest Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, and Mago,should unite their forces with those of that commander.Contenting himself therefore with sending some troopsto occupy the passes of the Pyrenees, he passed theremainder of the summer in receiving the submissionsof the Spanish states. Not many days after the battlefought at Baecula, when Scipio, on his return to Tar-raco, had just got clear of the pass of Castulo, the twogenerals, from the Farther Spain, Hasdrubal, son ofGisgo, and Mago, joined Hasdrubal—a reinforcementtoo late, the battle being lost; but their coming was

nence overlooking his camp, from whence, along acontinued ridge of hills, they could retire with safetyto the Romans. When Hasdrubal saw the enemy'sstrength increasing by such large accessions, while hisown was daily diminished, and would probably, unlessby a bold effort he effected something, continue to de­cay, in the same manner as it had begun, be resolvedto bring on a battle as soon as possible, Scipio waseven more desirous of an engagement; as well becausehis hopes were strong, in consequence of the successwhich had hitherto attended his affairs, as because hewished to engage with a single general and his forcesrather than with all together, which be would perhapsbe forced to do were they to unite. However, shouldhe be under a necessity of fighting more than one armyat once, he had taken a judicious method to augmenthis strength: for, perceiving that there would be noemployment for his marine, as the coast of Spain wasintirely clear of any Carthaginian fleet, he hauled upthe ships on land at Tarraco, and joined the marinesto his land forces. As to arms for them, he had abun­dance, between those taken at Carthage, and thosewhich had been afterwards made by the great numberof workmen whom he employed. With this forceScipio, in the beginning of spring, by which time hewas rejoined by Laelius, who had returned from Rome,and without whom he undertook no enterprise of anyextraordinary moment, set out from Tarraco, and ad­vanced towards the enemy. On his march, duringwhich he found every place well affected, the alliesshowing him all respect, and escorting him as he passedthrough each of their states, he was met by Indibilisand Mandonius, with their armies. Indibilis spoke forboth, not with the ignorance and temerity of a barba­rian, but with a modest gravity, appearing rather toapologise for their changing sides, as a measure ofnecessity, than to boast of it, as if it had been greedilyembraced on the first opportunity; for 'he knew,' hesaid, ' that the term deserter was deemed dishonorableby a man's old associates, and held in suspicion by the

The Athenians, after this, confining theirtroops within the walls, Philip sounded a retreat, andpitched his camp at Cynosarges, a temple of Hercules,and a school surrounded by a grove. But Cynosarges,and Lycacum, and whatever was sacred or pleasant inthe neighborhood of the city, he burned to the ground,and levelled not only the houses, but sepulchres, pay­ing no regard, in the violence of his rage, to any privi­lege either of men or gods. •25. Next day, the gates having at first been shut,and afterwards suddenly thrown open, in consequenceof a body of Attalus' troops from jEgina, and theRomans from Piraeus, having entered the city, theking removed his camp to the distance of about threemiles. From thence he proceeded to Eleusis, in hopesof surprising the temple, and a fort which overlooksand surrounds it; but, finding that the guards wereattentive, and that the fleet was coming from Piraeusto support them, he laid aside the design, and led histroops, first to Megara, and then to Corinth; where,on hearing that the council of the Achaeans was thensitting at Argos, he went and joined the assembly, tothe surprise of that people. They were at the timeemployed in forming measures for a war against Na-bis, tyrant of the Lacedaemonians; who (observing, onthe command being transferred from Philopoemen toCycliades, a general much inferior to him, that theconfederates of the Achaeans were falling off,) had re­newed the war, and besides ravaging the territories ofhis neighbors, was become formidable even to thecities.

35. The negotiation, some time before commencedwith Masinissa, had been delayed by various causes:the Numidian choosing to confer only with Scipio him­self, and from his hand to receive the ratification of thecompact. This was Scipio's reason for undertaking atthat time so long a journey, and to places so distantfrom his quarters. When Masinissa received notice atGades from Marcius that he was drawing nigh, com­plaining that his horses were injured by being pent upin the island; that they not only caused a scarcity ofevery thing among the men, but felt it themselves;and besides that the horsemen were losing their spiritsthrough want of exercise; he prevailed on Mago toallow him to pass over to the continent, to plunder theadjacent country of the Spaniards. On landing hesent forward three chiefs of the Nuniidians, to fix atime and place for a conference, desiring that two ofthem might be detained by Scipio as hostages, and thethird sent back to conduct him to the place appointed.They came to the conference with but few attendants;the Numidian had long been possessed with admirationof the man he was about to meet, from the fame of hisexploits, and had formed a perfect idea of the grandeurand dignity of his person. But on seeing him, hisveneration increased; for the elegance of his appear­ance, naturally majestic, was added to by his flowinghair, and by his becoming dress, not decorated withornaments, but in a style truly manly and military;by his age also, as he was in full vigor, aided by thebloom of youth, renewed as it were after his late ill­ness.

the annulling of his commission was negatived, but, onthe day following, every one of the centuries, with thegreatest unanimity, concurred in electing him consul.The colleague joined with him was Titus Quintius Cris-pinus, then a pretor. Next day were elected pretors,Publius Licinius Crassus Dives, then chief pontiff,Publius Licinius Varus, Sextus Julius Cassar, QuintusClaudius, flamen. During the very time of the elec­tions the public were much disturbed with apprehen­sions of a revolt in Etruria. That some scheme of thatkind had been set on foot by the Arretians was assertedin a letter of Caius Calpurnius, who, in the characterof propretor, held the government of that province.Wherefore Marcellus, consul elect, was immediatelydespatched thither, with orders to inquire into the affair,and, if he should see occasion, to send for his army,and remove the war from Apulia to Etruria. The fearof this gave the Etrurians such a check as kept themquiet. Ambassadors from the Tarentines came to so­licit a treaty of peace, requesting that they might beallowed to live in freedom under their own laws;but the senate desired them to come again, when theconsul Fabius would have returned to Rome. Boththe Roman and plebeian games were this year repeatedfor one day. The curule ediles were Lucius CorneliusCaudinus, and Servius Sulpicius Galba; the plebeian,Caius Servilius and Quintus Caecilius Metellus.

morning the Romans stood, in order of battle, fromsunrise, during a great part of the day ; and none ofthe enemy coming out to face them, gathered the spoilsat their leisure, and collecting the bodies of their slaininto one spot, burned them on a funeral pile. In thefollowing night Hannibal decamped in silence, andmarched off towards Apulia; but, as soon as daylightdiscovered the enemy's flight, Marcellus, leaving hiswounded at Numistro, with a small garrison, the com­mand of which he gave to Lucius Furius Purpureo, amilitary tribune, set out immediately in close pursuit,and overtook him at Venusia. Here, during severaldays, many skirmishes happened between parties sal­lying from the outposts, in which infantry and cavalrywere intermixed, and which produced more noise andtumult than real advantage to either side; but which,in general, terminated in favor of the Romans. Fromthence the two armies marched through Apulia with­out any engagement of consequence; for Hannibal,seeking opportunities for stratagems, removed alwaysby night, Marcellus never following but in clear day­light, and after having carefully examined the countrythrough which he was to pass.
3. Meanwhile, as Flaccus was spending much timeat Capua, in selling the property of the nobility, andsetting to farm the forfeited estates, all of which he letfor a rent of corn, he was furnished with a fresh occa­sion for practising severity on the Campanians; for hereceived certain information of a wicked scheme, of anextraordinary nature, which had for some time beenhatching in secret. Having removed the soldiers outof the houses, for two reasons, first, because he chosethat the houses of the city should be held along withthe lands; and next, because he feared lest excessiveluxury might enervate his army, as it had that ofHannibal, he had made them build huts for them­selves, in the military manner, near the gates andwalls.

part of the plan had been given in charge, seeing thatfew survived the battle, and that these were exhaustedby fatigue and wounds, sent the priests (having theirheads bound with the fillets of suppliants) at the dawnof the next day to surrender the city to Philip.
18. Before the surrender, one of the Roman ambas­sadors who had been sent to Alexandria, MarcusjEmilius, being the youngest of them, in pursuanceof a resolution which the three had jointly formed, onhearing of the present siege, came to Philip, and com­plained of his having made war on Attalus and theRhodians; and particularly of the attack on Abydus,in which he was then employed: and on Philip's say­ing that he had been forced into the war by Attalusand the Rhodians commencing hostilities against him,—' Did the people of Abydus, too,' said he, ' com­mence hostilities against you?' To him, who wasunaccustomed to hear truth, this language seemed tooarrogant to be used to a king, and he answered,—'Your youth, the beauty of your form, and, aboveall, the name of Roman, render you too presumptuous.However, my first desire is, that you would observethe treaties, and continue in peace with me; but ifyou begin an attack, I am, on my part, determined toprove that the kingdom and name of the Macedoniansis not less formidable in war than that of the Romans.'Having dismissed the ambassadors in this manner,Philip got possession of the gold and silver which hadbeen thrown together in a heap, but was disappointedof his booty with respect to prisoners: for such vio­lent frensy had seized the multitude, that, on a sud­den, taking up a persuasion that they were guilty oftreachery towards those who had fallen in the battle,and upbraiding one another with perjury, especiallythe priests, who would surrender alive to the enemythose persons whom they themselves had devoted, theyall at once ran different ways to put their wives andchildren to death; and then they put an end to theirown lives by every possible method.

2. He had arrived within about three miles, and notone of the enemy had yet descried him; craggy rocks,interspersed with thick bushes, covered the hills.Here, in a valley so deep as to be out of the way ofobservation, he ordered his men to halt, and take re­freshment: the scouts in the mean time arrived, con­firming the intelligence given by the deserters. Onthis the Romans, collecting the baggage into the centre,armed themselves, and moved forward in regular order.At the distance of a mile they were perceived by theenemy, among whom their appearance immediatelycreated much hurry and confusion. On the first shout,Mago rode up in full speed from his camp. Now therewere, in the Celtiberian army, four thousand targeteers,and two hundred horsemen: this regular legion (andit was almost the whole of their strength) he placed inthe first line; the rest, who were lightly armed, heposted in reserve. While he was leading them out ofthe camp in this order, and when they had scarcely gotclear of the rampart, the Romans discharged theirjavelins at them ; these the Spaniards stooped to avoid,and then the enemy rose to discharge their own ; which,when the Romans, in close array, had received on theirconjoined shields, in their accustomed manner, theyimmediately closed foot to foot, and had recourse totheir swards to determine the contest. But the nneven-ness of the ground, at the same time that it renderedtheir agility useless to the Celtiberians, who practise adesultory method of fighting, was no disadvantage tothe Romans, accustomed to a steady fight, except thatthe narrow passes, and the bushes interspersed, dis­ordered their ranks, and obliged them to engage oneagainst one, or two against two, as if they had been'matched for the combat.

38. After due expiations were offered to the gods,the consuls began to enlist soldiers; and this businessthey enforced with more strictness and severity thanhad been formerly practised within the memory of anythen living; for the new enemy, advancing towardsItaly, made the war doubly formidable. As the num­ber of young men capable of serving was considerablydiminished, they resolved to compel even the maritimecolonies to furnish soldiers, although they were said toenjoy, under a solemn grant, an immunity from service.At first, they refused compliance; on which the con­suls published orders that each state should, on a cer­tain day, produce before the senate the title on whichit claimed such exemption. On the day appointed, thefollowing states appeared before the senate ; Ostia, Al-sia, Antium, Auxur, Minturnae, Sinuessa; and, fromthe coast of the upper sea, Sena. These recited theirseveral claims; but none of them were allowed, exceptthose of Antium and Ostia; and even in these two co­lonies the young men were obliged to swear that, whilethe enemy remained in Italy, they would not lodge outof the walls of their colonies longer than thirty days.Although it was the opinion of all, that the consulsought to open the campaign as early as possible, as itwould be necessary to oppose Hasdrubal immediatelyon his descent from the Alps, lest he might seduce theCisalpine Gauls and Etruria, which latter already en­tertained sanguine hopes of effecting a revolt; also, thatit would be necessary to give Hannibal full employ­ment in his ovvn quarters, lest he might extricate him­self from Bruttium, and advance to meet his brother:yet Livius delayed, not being satisfied with the forcesdestined for his provinces, while his colleague had achoice of two excellent consular armies, and a thirdwhich Quintus Claudius commanded at Tarentum; he

tion, he set out again with wonderful resolution tomake another effort for the recovery of his kingdom.He collected in his way not more than forty horse­men; but, as soon as he arrived among the Massy-lians, and made himself known to them, they were sopowerfully actuated both by their former affection andthe unhoped-for joy at seeing him in safety, whomthey believed to have perished, that in a few days sixthousand armed foot and four thousand horse repairedto his standard; and he not only got possession of hisfather's kingdom, but laid waste the countries in al­liance with the Carthaginians, and the frontiers of theMasaesylians, the dominion of Syphax. Having thusprovoked the Numidians to war, he took post betweenCirtha and Hippo, on the tops of mountains, in asituation convenient for all his purposes.
33. Syphax, thinking this an affair of too much im­portance to he intrusted to the management of hisgenerals, sent a part of his army with his son Ver-mina, then a youth, with orders to march round in acircuit, and fall on the enemy's rear when he himselfshould have attracted their attention to his side. Ver-mina set out by night, so as to be concealed until heshould begin the attack; but Syphax decamped in theday, and marched openly, as he was to engage in aregular pitched battle. When he thought that suffi­cient time had been allowed for those who had beensent round to have arrived at their station, he led hisforces by a gentle acclivity directly up the mountain,for he relied both on his numbers and the ambuscadewhich he had prepared on his enemy's rear. Masi-nissa, on the other side, drew up his men, dependingchiefly on the advantage of the ground; although, hadit been much less in his favor, he would not have de­clined the fight. The battle was furious, and for along time doubtful: Masinissa being favored by hissituation and the bravery of his men; Syphax by hisnumbers, which were more than abundant. This greatmultitude being divided, one part pressed on in front,while the other part surrounded the rear; which gave

tection of Masinissa, he should enjoy the same honor­able provision which jEsalces had formerly knownunder Gala; and to assure Mezetulus not only of im­punity, but of an intire restitution of all his property.As they both preferred a moderate share of fortune athome to exile, he brought them over to his side, not­withstanding the Carthaginians used every means toprevent it.
31. During these transactions Hasdrubal happenedto be with Syphax; and when the Numidian seemedto think that it was of little consequence to him whe­ther the government of the Massylians were in thehands of Lacumaces or of Masinissa, he told him that* he would be greatly mistaken in supposing that Ma­sinissa would be content with the acquisitions whichhad satisfied bis father Gala, or his uncle yEsalces.That he was possessed of much greater spirit and un­derstanding than had ever appeared in any of his race:that he had often in Spain exhibited, both to his alliesand enemies, instances of such courage as is very rarelyseen: that both Syphax and the Carthaginians, unlessthey smothered that rising name, would soon be enve­loped in a general conflagration, when it would not bein their power to help themselves: that as yet hisstrength was infirm, and might be easily broken,while he was endeavoring to heal the divisions of hiskingdom.' By such kind of arguments Syphax wasinduced to lead an army to the frontiers of the Massy­lians, into a district about which there had often beennot only verbal disputes, but battles fought with Gala;and there to pitch his camp, as if it were his acknow-leged property; alleging that, 'if any opposition weremade, which was what was most to be wished, hewould have an opportunity of fighting; but if the dis­trict were abandoned through fear, he should then pro­ceed into the heart of the kingdom: that the Massy­lians would either submit to his authority without acontest, or, at all events, would be unable to contendwith him.' Stimulated by such discourses, Syphaxmade war on Masinissa, and in the first encounter

men, and against the nature of the places, for five suc­cessive months, he had not the least expectation thatthe other would be able to effect his purpose with somuch more ease and expedition; and, for this reason,he was the later in quitting his winter quarters. ButHasdrubal found every thing to proceed more easilyand expeditiously than either himself or others hadeven ventured to hope: for the Arvernians, and after­wards the other Gallic and Alpine tribes, not onlygave him a friendly reception, but even accompaniedhim to the war. Then, in most parts of the countrythrough which he marched, roads had been made byhis brother in places until then impassable; besideswhich, as the Alps had, for twelve years, been a con­stant route for divers people, he found the dispositionof the inhabitants much improved: for in former times,being never visited by foreigners, or accustomed to seea stranger in their country, they were unsociable to­wards all the human race. Being ignorant at first ofthe destination of the Carthaginian, they had imaginedthat his object was their rocks and forts, and to makeprey of their men and cattle: but the accounts whichthey heard of the Punic war, and by which Italy hadso long been harassed, by this time fully convincedthem that the Alps were only used as a passage, andthat two overgrown states, separated by vast tracks ofsea and land, were contending for power and empire.These causes opened the Alps to Hasdrubal. Butwhatever advantage he gained from the celerity of hismarch, he lost it all by delaying at Placentia, wherehe carried on a fruitless blockade, rather than an at­tack. He had supposed that the reduction of a town,standing in a plain, would be easily accomplished ; andbeing a colony of great note, he was persuaded that,by destroying this city, he should fill the rest withterror. That siege, however, not only impeded hisown progress, but also stopped Hannibal, when he wasjust setting out from his winter quarters, in conse­quence of hearing that his brother had reached Italyso much more quickly than he had expected: for he

As he entered the porch, Sophonisba,Syphax's queen, daughter of Hasdrubal the Cartha­ginian, met him at the door; where, seeing Masinissain the midst of a band of armed men, distinguished byhis arms and apparel, and judging rightly that he wasthe king, she fell at his knees, and thus addressedhim: 'The favor of the gods, added to your own valorand good fortune, has given you absolute power to dis­pose of us. But if, in the presence of the sovereigndisposer of her life and death, a captive may be allowedto utter the words of a suppliant, to touch his knees,or victorious right hand, I intreat and beseech you, bythe majesty of a king, of which we also were just nowpossessed; by the name of the Numidian race, whichis common to you and Syphax; by the guardian godsof this palace, who, I hope, will receive you with betteromens than they sent Syphax hence, grant so muchfavor to your suppliant, as that you will, yourself, de­termine whatever you may think proper concerningyour captive, and not suffer me to fall under thehaughty and cruel disposal of any Roman. Were Inothing more than the wife of Syphax, I had muchrather trust to the honor of a Numidian, one born inthe same country with me, than to a foreigner, and froma distant part of the world: but what a Carthaginian,what the daughter of Hasdrubal, has reason to dreadfrom a Roman, is manifest to you. If you cannot byany other means, I implore and beseech you, that youwill, by my death, secure me from the power of theRomans.' She was remarkably beautiful, and in thefull bloom of youth: so that, while she pressed hisright hand, and implored his protection only so far, asthat she should not be delivered up to any Roman, herdiscourse was more like caresses than ifitreaty; and

trained to making war against the Romans during many-campaigns in Spain, and rendered famous by a doublevictory over them, by the destruction of two of theirarmies, and two of their ablest commanders. Withrespect to the speedy accomplishment of his marchfrom Spain, and his address in rousing the Gallic clansto arms, he had much more reason to boast than Han­nibal himself; because he had collected a body ofauxiliaries in those very places where the other hadlost the greater part of his soldiers by hunger and cold,the two most miserable ways in which men can perish.*To all this, people acquainted with the transactions inSpain added, that 'in Nero he would meet an anta­gonist with whom he was not unacquainted; one whom,formerly, when caught accidentally in a dangerous de­file, he had baffled, just as he would a child, by falla­cious terms of peace.' Seeing every thing through themedium of fear, which always represents objects inthe worst light, they judged all the resources of theenemy greater, and their own less, than they were inreality.
45. When Nero had attained to such a distancefrom the enemy that his design might be disclosed withsafety, he addressed his soldiers in a few words, tell­ing them that 'no general had ever formed a designmore daring in appearance, and yet more safe in theexecution than his: that he was leading them to cer­tain victory; for as his colleague had not marchedagainst that enemy until the senate had given him sucha force, both of infantry and cavalry, as fully satisfiedhis utmost wishes, and those troops more numerousand better provided than if he were to go against Han­nibal himself, the addition thus made to it, whatevermight be its intrinsic weight, would certainly turn thescale in his favor. As soon as the foe should hear, in thefield of battle, (and he would take care that they shouldnot hear sooner,) that another consul, and anotherarmy had arrived, this single circumstance would in­sure success.

As soon as the appoint­ment of magistrates for the year was finished, QuintusFulvius resigned the dictatorship. Towards the endof this summer a Carthaginian fleet of forty ships,under the command of Hamilcar, sailed over to Sar­dinia, and committed great depredations in the dis­trict of Olbia. Afterwards, on the pretor PubliusManlius Vulso appearing there with an army, theyproceeded to the other side of the island, and ravagedthe lands of Caralita, from whence they returned withbooty of all kinds to Africa. Several Roman priestsdied this year, and others were substituted in theirplaces. Caius Servilius was made a pontiff, in theroom of Titus Otacilius Crassus; Tiberius Sempro-nius Longus, son of Tiberius, an augur, in the room ofOtacilius Crassus; and the same Tiberius Sempronius,a decemvir for directing religious rites, in the room ofTiberius Sempronius Longus, son of Caius. MarcusMarcius, king in religious matters, and Marcus jEmi-lius Papus, chief curio, died, but their places werenot filled up during this year. Lucius Veturius Philo,and Publius Licinius Crassus, chief pontiff, were cre­ated censors for the year. Licinius Crassus had not,before this appointment, been either consul or pretor,but was advanced, at one step, from the edileship tothe censorship. However, these censors neither chosea senate, nor transacted any public business, beingprevented by the death of Lucius Veturius, on whichLicinius abdicated the office. The curule ediles, Lu­cius Veturius and Publius Licinius Varus, repeatedthe exhibition of the Roman games once.

He likewise madedivision of the fleet, which consisted of seventy sail, inorder that they might extend their protection of thecoasts round the whole circumference of the island.Attended by the cavalry of Mutines, he went in personthrough e-'ery part of the province, to view the lands,observe-' hat parts were cultivated, and what were not,comnr'i' ing or reproving the owners accordingly. InconseC'ence of his care in this particular, such anabundance of corn was produced that, besides sendinga quantity to Rome, he conveyed to Catana a sufficientsupply for the army, which was to be employed duringthe summer at Tarentum.
9. But the transportation of those soldiers into Sicily,the greater part of whom were Latines and allies, wasvery near proving the cause of formidable disturbances;so true it is, that the issues of great affairs often dependon trivial circumstances: for the Latines and allies, intheir meetings, began to murmur that ' they had nowfor ten years been drained by levies and contributions.That generally every year they suffered great losses inthe war. Many were slain in the field, many werecut off by sickness; and that every one of their coun­trymen, enlisted as a soldier by the Romans, was moreeffectually lost to them, than if he were taken prisonerby the Carthaginians; because the latter was sent back,without ransom, to his country, whereas the other wasordered by the Romans out of Italy, into banishmentindeed, rather than to military service. The troops ofCannae were now growing old in that situation, havingbeen in it nearly eight years, and would end their livesbefore the enemy, whose strength was at the present ina state particularly florishing, would retire out of Italy.Jf veteran soldiers were not to return home, and stillnew ones to be enlisted, there would not, in a shorttime, be one of that description remaining.

We have a tem­ple of Proserpine of extraordinary sanctity, of whichprobably some account may have reached you duringthe war with Pyrrhus; for in his return from Sicily,sailing near Locri with bis fleet, among other violentoutrages against our city, on account of our fidelity toyou, he plundered the treasures of Proserpine, whichto that day had ever remained untouched; and then,putting the money on board bis ships, he left the land.What was then the result, conscript fathers?

Ariminuni. He immediately informed the senate, byletter, of the subsisting tumult: that, 'of the two co­lonies which had escaped the general wreck in thedreadful storm of the Punic war, one was taken andsacked by the present enemy, and the other besieged.Nor was his army capable of affording sufficient pro­tection to the distressed colonists, unless he chose toexpose five thousand allies to be slaughtered by fortythousand invaders (for so many there were in arms);and by such a loss, on his side, to augment their cou­rage, already elated on having destroyed one Romancolony.'
11. On reading this letter it was decreed, that theconsul Aurelius should order the army which he hadappointed to assemble on a certain day in Etruria toattend him on the same day at Ariminum; and shouldeither go in person, if the public business would per­mit, to suppress the tumult of the Gauls, or write tothe pretor Lucius Furius, that, as soon as the legionsfrom Etruria came to him, he should send five thou­sand of the allies to guard that place in the mean time,and should himself proceed to relieve the colony fromthe siege. It was also decreed that ambassadors shouldbe sent to Carthage, and also into Numidia to Masi-nissa: to Carthage, to tell that people that ' their coun­tryman, Hamilcar, having been left in Gaul, (eitherwith a part of the army formerly commanded by Has-drubal, or with that of Mago—they did not with cer­tainty know which,) was waging war, contrary to thetreaty: that he had raised forces from among the Gaulsand Ligurians, and persuaded them to take arms againstRome: that, if they ehose a continuance of peace, theymust recall him, and give him up to the Roman peo­ple.' They were ordered at the same time to tell them,that 'all the deserters had not been produced; that agreat part of them were said to appear openly in Car­thage, who ought to be sought after, and surrenderedaccording to the treaty.' This was the message theywere to deliver to the Carthaginians. To Masinissathey were charged with congratulations, on his ' having

To Caius Hostilius fellthe city jurisdiction, to which the foreign was added,in order that three pretors might go abroad to the pro­vinces. To Aulus Hostilius fell Sardinia; to CaiusMamilius, Sicily; and to Lucius Porcius, Gaul. Thewhole of the legions, amounting to twenty-three, weredistributed in such manner that each of the consulsshould have two, Spain four, the three pretors, inSicily, Sardinia, and Gaul, two each; Caius Teren-tius, in Etruria, two; Quintus Fulvius, in liruttium,two; Quintus Claudius, about Tarentum and Sallen-tum, two; Caius Hostilius Tubulus, at Capua, one;and two were ordered to be raised for the city. Forthe first four legions the people elected tribunes; forthe rest they were appointed by the consuls.
37. Before the consuls left home the nine days'solemnity was performed, on account of a shower ofstones having fallen from the sky at Veii. The men­tion of one prodigy was, as usual, followed by reportsof others; that the temple of Jupiter at Miuturnae, agrove at Marica, a wall and a gate of Atella, had beenstruck by lightning. The people of Minturntc said,what was still more terrifying, that a stream of bloodhad flowed in at one of their gates: at Capua, too, awolf came into one of the gates, and tore the sentinel.These prodigies were expiated with victims of thegreater kinds; and a supplication of one day's con­tinuance was ordered by the pontiffs. The nine days'solemnity was afterwards performed a second time, onaccount of a shower of stones seen to fall during thearmilustrum.

omen is pleasing; steer your ships thither.' The fleetran down accordingly, and all the forces were disem­barked. I am inclined to follow the accounts of verymany Greek and Latin authors; which are, that thevoyage was prosperous, and without danger or con­fusion. Coelius alone (except that he does not repre­sent the ships as being lost) gives a narration of everyother dreadful occurrence, which could be occasionedby wind or waves; that, at last, the fleet was drivenfrom Africa to the island jEgimurus ; that from thence,with difficulty, they recovered their course; and thatthe men had, without orders from the general, escapedto land in boats from the almost foundering vessels,just, in short, as from a shipwreck, without arms andin the utmost disorder.
28. The troops being landed, formed their camp onthe nearest rising grounds. The sight of the fleet, withthe bustle of landing, spread consternation and terror,not only through the parts adjoining the sea, but evenamong the cities: for not only crowds of women andchildren, mixing with the bands of men, filled up allthe roads, but the country people also drove theircattle before them, so that it seemed as if they were allat once forsaking Africa. Those caused much greaterterror in the cities than they had felt themselves, par­ticularly at Carthage, where the tumult was almost asgreat as though the enemy were at its gates; for, sincethe consulate of Marcus Attilius Regulus and LuciusManlius, a space of nearly fifty years, they had seenno Roman army, except those predatory squadrons,from which some troops had made descents on the ad­joining coast, seizing whatever chance threw in theirway, but who had always made a hasty retreat to theirships, and before the peasantry had taken the alarm:for this reason, the consternation and panic was nowthe greater; and, in fact, they had neither a powerfularmy at home, nor a general whom they could opposeto the invaders.

He then enumerated his services to theCarthaginian generals; and, on the other hand, theiravarice, tyranny, and ill-treatment of every kind heapedon him and his countrymen. 'For these reasons,' hesaid, ' his body only had, hitherto, been on their side;his mind had long been on that side where, he be­lieved, that respect was paid to laws divine and human.To the gods themselves people have recourse with sup­plications for redress, when they can no longer endurethe violence and injustice of men. He intreated Sci-pio not to consider their conduct as deserving eitherpunishment or reward, but to form his judgment on atrial of them from that day forward, and by that stan­dard to estimate the recompense which they mighthereafter be thought to deserve.' The Roman an­swered that he would comply with their desire in everyparticular; and would not consider them in the lightof deserters, because they had not thought themselvesbound to adhere to such an alliance, when the otherparty scrupled not to violate every obligation divineand human. Then their wives and children, beingbrought into the assembly, were restored to them, andreceived with tears of joy.

As to other matters, Irather wish that you would review them in your ownmind, than that you should blush at my recital of them.Syphax has been subdued and taken under the auspicesof the Roman people: therefore he, his wife, his king­dom, his territories, his towns, and the inhabitants ofthem; in short, whatever was the property of Syphaxis now the prize of that people. Both the king and hiswife, even though she were not a citizen of Carthage,and we had not seen her father heading the enemy'sarmy, ought to have been sent to Rome, where theRoman state should have had the power of judging auddetermining concerning her-—a woman who is said tohave seduced a king in alliance with us, and tohave precipitated him into the war. Restrain yourfeelings. Beware, lest by one vice you disparage anumber of good qualities, and destroy the credit of somany meritorious deeds by a fault, too great to bepalliated, even by the occasion of it.'
15. On hearing this discourse, not only Masinissa'scountenance was suffused with blushes, but he evenburst into tears; and after declaring that 'in futurehe would be directed intirely by Scipio,' and intreat-ing him, ' as far as the affair would permit, to considerthe obligation into which he had rashly entered, not togive the queen into the power of any one,' he retired inconfusion from the general's tent to his own. There,dismissing his attendants, he spent some time in sighsand moans, which could be heard distinctly by thosewho stood without. At last, having uttered a deepgroan, he called one of his servants, in whom he con­fided, and who had the charge of the poison, which,according to the custom of kings, is kept against theuncertainties of fortune, and ordered him to mix some

after the destruction of Hasdrubal and his army, onwhom he had reposed all his hopes of victory, andwhen he had given up the possession of all the rest ofItaly, and withdrawn into a corner of Bruttium, mustit not appear wonderful to all that no disturbancearose in his camp? for there was this afflicting circum­stance in addition to all his other difficulties, that hehad no hope of being able even to procure food for hissoldiers, except from the lands of Bruttium; which, ifthey were intirely under tillage, were too small for thesupport of so large an army. Besides, the war hademployed a great part of the young men, and carriedthem away from the cultivation of the grounds; a basepractice likewise prevailing through the whole nation,of making plundering excursions on every side; norwere there any remittances made him from home,where the whole attention of the public was engaged inendeavoring to keep possession of Spain, as if affairsin Italy were all in a state of prosperity. In theformer, the fortune of the parties was in one respectthe same; in another, widely different: the same so far,that the Carthaginians, being defeated in battle, andhaving lost their general, had been driven to the re­motest coast of the country, even to the ocean; butdifferent in this, that Spain, in the nature both of theground and of the inhabitants, affords greater conve­niences for reviving a war, not only than Italy, butthan any other part of the world; and that was thereason, that although tins was the first of all the pro­vinces on the continent in which the Romans got foot­ing, yet it was the last subdued; and that not untilthe present age, under the conduct and auspices ofAugustus Caesar. In this country Hasdrubal, son ofGisgo, a general of the greatest abilities and characternext to the Barcine family, returning now from Gades,and being encouraged to a renewal of the war by Mago,the son of Hamilcar, armed to the number of fiftythousand foot, and four thousand five hundred horse,by levies made in the Farther Spain.

Chap. 1. Cneius Servilius C^pio and Cains Servi-lius Geminus, in the sixteenth year of the Punic war[A. U. C. 549. B. C. 203], consulted the Senate on thestate of public affairs, the war, and the provinces.The senate decreed that the consuls should decidebetween themselves, or determine by lot, which ofthem should hold the province of Bruttium, and actagainst Hannibal; and which that of Etruria and Li-guria. That he to whose lot Bruttium fell should re­ceive the army from Publius Sempronius, late consut.That Publius Sempronius, to whom the command wascontinued as proconsul for a year, should succeedPublius Licinius, who was to come home to Rome.This commander bad now acquired a high reputationfor military skill, in addition to his other excellentqualifications, of which no citizen, at that time, pos­sessed such an abundance; nature and fortune con­spiring to confer on him every thing valuable in man.He was of a noble race, and possessed great wealth;he excelled in personal beauty and strength of body;he was esteemed the most eloquent of his time, whe­ther he pleaded in the courts of justice, or enforcedor opposed any measure, either in the senate, or be­fore the people; and was, besides, remarkably skilledin the pontifical law.

A great quantity of arms wastaken, all which the general dedicated to Vulcan, andcommitted to the flames.
7. Hasdrubal, with a small number of Africans, haddirected his flight to the nearest city; and thither allwho survived, following the steps of their general, hadassembled; but, dreading lest he should be deliveredinto the hands of Scipio, he soon after quitted it. TheRomans, who were immediately after received there,committed no act of hostility, because the surrenderwas voluntary. Two other cities were taken andplundered; and the booty found in them, togetherwith what had been saved when the camps were burned,was given up to the soldiers. Syphax halted in afortified post, at about eight miles distance. Has­drubal, lest any timorous measures should be adoptedthrough the violent apprehensions occasioned by thelate disaster, proceeded to Carthage, where such con­sternation had seized the people, that they made nodoubt but Scipio would leave Utica, and instantly laysiege to Carthage. The senate was therefore assem­bled by the suffetes, who are invested with the sameauthority as our consuls. Three different opinionswere offered on the occasion: one proposed sendingambassadors to Scipio, with proposals of peace; ano­ther, the recalling of Hannibal, to defend his country;the third showed Roman firmness in adversity, recom­mending to recruit the army, and to intreat Syphaxnot to abandon the war. This latter opinion prevailed,because Hasdrubal, who was present, and all of theBarcine faction, were disposed to fight to the last. Onthis they began to levy troops in the city and the coun­try, and sent ambassadors to Syphax, who was himselfmost vigorously employed in making preparations forthe renewal of hostilities.

Africa, and the siege of Carthage; and when theypossessed not by any means such a degree of strengthas the Romans had enjoyed to support them underthose calamities. The latter had received, from thecommonalty of Rome, and from Latium, continuallyincreasing supplies of young men in the room of somany legions destroyed: but the citizens of Carthagewere unwarlike, and equally so in the country. Auxi­liaries, indeed, they had procured for pay from amongthe Africans; but they were a faithless race, and veer­ing about with every blast of fortune. Then, as to thekings: Sypfaax, since his conference with Scipio, wasapparently estranged from them: Masinissa had openlyrenounced their alliance, and was become their mostinveterate enemy; so that they had no hope, no sup­port on any side. Neither did Mago raise any com­motions on the side of Gaul, nor join his forces toHannibal's: and Hannibal himself was now decliningboth in reputation and strength.' Their minds, which,in consequence of the late news, had sunk into thesedesponding reflections, were again recalled, by dreadof the impending evils, to consult how they might op­pose the present dangers. They resolved to levysoldiers with all haste, both in the city and the coun­try; to hire auxiliaries from the Africans ; to strengthenthe forts; to collect oorn; to prepare weapons and ar­mor; to fit out ships, and send them to Hippo against theRoman fleet. While they were thus employed, news atlength arrived that it was Laelius, and not Scipio, whohad come over; that his forces were no more than whatwere sufficient to make plundering incursions; and thatthe main force of the enemy was still in Sicily. Thusthey got time to breathe, and began to despatch em­bassies to Syphax and the other princes, to endeavorto strengthen their alliances. They also sent to Philip,with a promise of two hundred talents of silver,i on con­dition that he invaded Sicily or Italy. Others weresent to Italy, to their two generals there, with orders

After holding out for two days in thecitadel, relying more on the strength of the place thanon their arms, on the third both they and the garrisoncapitulated, on condition of their being transported toDelium in Boeotia, and being each of them allowed asingle suit of apparel. The island was yielded up bythe Romans to king Attalus; the spoil, and the orna­ments of the city, they themselves carried off. Attalus,desirous that the island, of which he had got posses­sion, might not be quite deserted, persuaded almost allthe Macedonians, and several of the Andrians, to re­main there; and, in some time after, those who, ac­cording to the capitulation, had been transported toDelium, were induced to return from thence by thepromises made them by the king, in which they weredisposed the more readily to confide, by the ardentaffection which they felt for their native country. FromAndros the combined army passed over to Cythnus:there they spent several days to no purpose, in at­tempting to get possession of the city ; when, at length,finding it scarcely worth the trouble, they departed.At Prasiae, a place on the main land of Attica, twentybarks of the Issrcans joined the Roman fleet. Thesewere sent to ravage the lands of the Carystians, therest of the fleet lying at Geraestus, a noted harbor inEuboea, until their return from Carystus: on which,setting sail together, and steering their course throughthe open sea, until they passed by Scyrus, they arrivedat the island of Icus. Being detained there for a fewdays by a violent northerly wind, as soon as it abated,they passed over to Sciathus, a city which had beenlately plundered and desolated by Philip. The sol­diers, spreading themselves over the country, broughtback to the ships corn and many other kinds of pro­visions. Plunder there was none, nor had the Greeksdeserved to be plundered.

witness of their behavior. On Hannibal's side, thefront line was composed of the Spanish troops, whowere the main strength of his army. When the fighthad long continued doubtful, Hannibal ordered theelephants to be brought up to the van, hoping by theirmeans to occasion fear and disorder. At first theybroke the ranks, and by treading down some, and ter­rifying others, on either side, so as to put them toflight, made an opening in the line in one part; andthe alarm would probably have spread farther, hadnot Caius Decimius Flavus, a military tribune, snatch­ing the standard of the first band of spearmen, orderedthat company to follow him. He then led them to thespot where the elephants were throwing all into con­fusion, with directions to discharge their javelins atthem. Every weapon took place, for there was nodifficulty in hitting, at a small distance, bodies of suchhuge bulk, especially as they were crowded closetogether. But though they were not all of themwounded, yet those, in whose flesh the javelins stuck,as they are creatures whose motions cannot be de­pended on, betaking themselves to flight, drove backeven those that were unhurt. And now, not anyparticular company alone, but every soldier who couldcome np with the retreating elephants, with all hismight hurled javelins at them. Thus attacked, themore violently did the animals rush on their owners,and made so much the greater carnage of them, thanthey had made of the enemy, as one of them, whenfrightened or hurt, is hurried on more forcibly thanhe could be driven by the manager sitting on his back.While the enemy's line was in this great disorder, inconsequence of those beasts breaking through it, theRomans made a brisk onset, and without much oppo­sition from troops so scattered and confused, drovethem off the ground.

posed. These, having now become the majority, pro­posed the question accordingly, while almost every oneof the states, openly approving the measure, showedplainly on which side they would vote. Whereon theDymaeans, Megalopolitans, with several of the Argives,rose up, and withdrew from the council; which stepexcited neither wonder nor disapprobation: for when,in the memory of their grandfathers, the Megalopoli­tans had been expelled their country by the Lacedae­monians, Antigonus had reinstated them in their nativeresidence; and, at a later period, when Dymas wastaken and sacked by the Roman troops, Philip orderedthat the inhabitants, wherever they were in servitude,should be ransomed, and not only restored them totheir liberty but their country. As to the Argives,besides believing that the royal family of Macedoniaderived its origin from them, the greater part were at­tached to Philip by personal acts of kindness and fa­miliar friendship. For these reasons, when the coun­cil appeared disposed to order an alliance to be con­cluded with Rome, they withdrew ; and their secessionwas readily excused, in consideration of the many andrecent obligations by which they were bound to theking of Macedon.
23. The rest of the Achaean states, on their opinionsbeing demanded, ratified, by an immediate decree, thealliance with Attalus and the Rhodians. That withthe Romans, as it could not be perfected without anorder from the people, they deferred until such time asthey could hear from Rome. For the present, it wa9resolved, that three ambassadors should be sent to Lu­cius Quintius; and that the whole force of the Achae-ans should be brought up to Corinth, which city Quin­tius, after taking Cenchrea, was then besieging. TheAchaeans accordingly pitched their camp opposite tothe gate that leads to Sicyon.

not send ambassadors to any other place than to Rome;and that if any such should come to Carthage, theyshould not dismiss them until the Roman general wasmade acquainted with their business. With the Car­thaginian ambassadors were sent to Rome Lucius Ve-turius Philo, Marcius Ralla, and Lucius Scipio, thegeneral's brother. From that time the great suppliesfrom Sicily and Sardinia caused such cheapness ofprovisions, that the merchant often furnished corn tothe mariners for the freight. At Rome there had beensome uneasiness on the first account of the Carthagi­nians having recommenced hostilities, and TiberiusClaudius had been ordered to conduct the fleet toSicily with all expedition, and to pass over fromthence to Carthage; and the other consul, MarcusServilius, to remain in the city, until the state of affairsin Africa should be known. Tiberius Claudius pro­ceeded slowly in every step towards the equipmentand sailing of the fleet, being offended at the senatehaving voted that Scipio, in preference to the consul,should have the honor of prescribing the terms ofpeace. Accounts of prodigies also, arriving a littlebefore the news of the revival of hostilities, had raisedpeople's apprehensions. At Cumae, the orb of the sunseemed to be diminished, and a shower of stones fell;and in the district of Veliturnum, the earth sunk ingreat chasms, in which trees were swallowed. At Ari-cia, the forum, and shops round it; at Frusino, severalparts of the wall, and a gate, were struck by lightning.On the Palatine hill, too, a shower of stones fell. Thisprodigy, according to the method handed down by tra­dition, was expiated by a nine days' solemnity; theothers by the greater victims. Among the rest, anunusual overflowing of the rivers was also consideredas a prodigy; for there was such an inundation of theTiber, that, the circus being filled with water, prepa­rations for the games of Apollo were made on the out­side of the Colline gate, near the temple of VenusErycina.

etice. Now the minds of the Achwans labored with acomplication of difficulties. They feared the Lacedae­monians, their constant and inveterate enemies; theydreaded the arms of the Romans; they were underobligations to the Macedonians, for services both ofancient and of recent date; but the king himself, onaccount of his perfidy and cruelty, they looked on withjealous fear, and not judging from the behavior whichhe then assumed for the time, they knew that, on theconclusion of the war, they should find him a moretyrannic master. So that every one of them was notonly at a loss what opinion he should support in thesenate of his own particular state, or in the generaldiets of the nation; but, even when they deliberatedwithin themselves, they could not with any certaintydetermine what they ought to wish, or what to prefer.Such was the unsettled state of mind of the membersof the assembly when the ambassadors were intro­duced to audience. The Roman ambassador, LuciusCalpurnius, spoke first; next the ambassadors of kingAttalus; after them, those of the Rhodians; and thenPhilip's. The Athenians were heard the last, thatthey might refute the discourses of the Macedonians.These inveighed against the king with the greatestacrimony of any, for no others had suffered from himso many and so severe hardships. So great a numberof speeches succeeding each other, took up the wholeof the day; and about sunset the council was ad­journed.

Next day the council met again; and when themagistrates, according to the custom of the Greeks,gave leave, by their herald, to any person who choseto deliver his sentiments, not one stood forth; but.they sat a long time, looking on each other in silence.It was no wonder that men, revolving in their mindsmatters of such contradictory natures, and who foundthemselves puzzled and confounded, should be involvedin additional perplexity by the speeches continuedthrough the whole preceding day; in which the diffi­culties, on all sides, were brought into view, and stated

As to myself, I am sensible of theinstability of human affairs; I am mindful of thepower of fortune, and I know that all our under­takings are subject to a thousand casualties. But as,on the other hand, if yon were retiring from Italyof your own accord, and, after embarking your troops,were come to solicit peace; if in that case I refused tolisten to you, I should acknowlege that I behavedwith pride and arrogance: so, on the other hand, nowthat I have dragged you into Africa, in spite of everyeffort which you used to prevent it, I am not bound toshow you any particular respect. If therefore, in ad­dition to the terms on which it was then intended toconclude a peace (and with which you are acquainted),a full compensation be proposed for having seized ourships and stores, during the subsistence of a truce, andfor the insult offered to my ambassadors, I shall thenhave matter to lay before my council. But if this alsoseem severe, prepare for war, since you must be insin­cere in proposing peace.' Thus, without coming to anyaccommodation, they retired to their respective armies,and informed them that words had been tried to nopurpose, that the business must be decided by arms,and they must abide the fortune which the gods shouldallot them.

Before the consul Claudius arrived inhis province, as Hannibal was leading his army to­wards Sallentum, through the very borders of theLarinatian frontiers, Cains Hostilius Tubulus, withsome lightly accoutred cohorts, attacked him, andcaused dreadful confusion among his unmarshalledtroops, killing four thousand men, and taking ninemilitary standards. Quintus Claudius, who had hisforces cantoned through the towns in the territory ofSallentum, on being apprised of the enemy's motions,marched out of his winter quarters: wherefore, Han­nibal, lest he should be obliged to encounter the twoarmies at once, decamped in the night, and withdrewfrom the Tarentine territory into Bruttium. Claudiusfell back to the country adjoining Sallentum. Hostilius,on his march towards Capua, met the consul Claudiusat Venusia; and here were selected, out of both armies,forty thousand foot, and two thousand five hundredhorse, with which the consul was to act against Han­nibal. The rest of the forces Hostilius was orderedto lead to Capua, that he might deliver them up toQuintus Fulvius, proconsul.

Hannibal, having drawn together his forcesfrom all quarters, both those which he had hithertokept in winter quarters, and those which were ingarrison in the Bruttian territory, came into Luca-nia to Grumentum, in hope of regaining the townswhich, through fear, had joined the Romans.

world, the Roman and Carthaginian, had paid suchdeference; that for the sake of procuring his friend­ship, their own general, Scipio, leaving his provinceand his army, sailed with only two quinqueremes toAfrica; and the Carthaginian general, Hasdrubal, notonly visited his kingdom, but also gave him his daughterin marriage. That the Roman and Carthaginian gene­rals had been within his grasp at one and the sametime. That as both parties had, by the offer of sacri­fices, solicited the favor of the immortal gods, so hisfriendship had been equally sought for by both. Thathe lately possessed power so great as to enable him toexpel Masinissa from his kingdom; and to reduce himto such a state, that his life was preserved by a reportof his death, and by lurking in concealment, while hewas obliged, like a wild beast, to live in the woods onprey.' Such were the discourses of the throng throughwhich the king was led to the general's quarters. Sci­pio was moved on comparing the former situation ofthe man with the present; and also by the recollectionof their connexion in hospitality, of their right handspledged, and the treaty concluded between themselvesand their states. These circumstances gave Syphaxcourage in addressing his conqueror: for, when Scipioasked him, 'what had been his views in not only re­nouncing his alliance with the Romans, but even makingwar on them V he answered that' he had indeed erred,or rather acted under an impulse of insanity; but notat that time, principally, when he took up arms againstthe Romans: that was the consequence of his madness,not the actual beginning of it. That he was indeedmad when he banished from his thoughts all the tiesof private friendship and public leagues, and when hereceived a Carthaginian wife into his house.

voke the jEtolians, who were ever well inclined toembrace an opportunity of sallying out from theirworks. They did not know that Sulpicius, with fifteenships, had come over from Naupactus to Cyllene. andlanding four thousand soldiers, had, in the dead ofnight, lest his march should be observed, thrown him­self into Elis. When therefore they perceived, amongthe yEtolians and Eleans, the Roman standards andarms, an appearance so unexpected filled them withthe greatest terror. At first the king had a mind toorder a retreat, but the jEtolians being already en­gaged with the Trallians, a tribe of Illyrians so called,and his party appearing to have the worst of the con­test, he himself, at the head of his cavalry, made acharge on a Roman cohort. Here the horse of Philip,being pierced through with a spear, threw him forwardover his head to the ground, which gave rise to a fu­rious conflict between the contending parties; the Ro­mans pressing hard on the king, and his own men pro­tecting him. His own behavior on the occasion wasremarkably brave, although he was obliged to fight onfoot, among squadrons of cavalry. In a short time,the dispute becoming unequal, great numbers beingkilled and wounded near him, he was forced away byhis soldiers, and, mounting another horse, fled from thefield. He pitched his camp that day at the distance offive miles from the city of Elis; and, on the next, ledall his forces to a fort called Pyrgus, where, as he hadheard, a multitude of the country people with theircattle had run together through fear of being plun­dered. This irregular and unarmed crowd were soutterly dismayed at his approach, that he at once madehimself master of the whole, and by this seizure gainedcompensation for whatever disgrace he had sustainedat Elis. While he was distributing the spoil and pri­soners, the latter amounting to four thousand men,and the cattle of all kinds to twenty thousand, newsarrived from Macedonia that a person called Eropushad, by bribing the commander of the garrison andcitadel, gained possession of Lychnidus; that he had

of two hundred sail. The business of Sicily was di­vided thus: the troops of Cannas were given to SextusCaesar; Marcus Valerius Laevinus (for he also wascontinued in authority) was to have the fleet of seventyships, which lay on the coast of that island. To thesewere joined the thirty ships which had been at Taren-tum the year before; and with this fleet of one hun­dred sail, if he thought proper, he was to pass overand make depredations on Africa. Publius Sulpicius,also, was continued in command for the year, that hemight hold the province of Macedonia and Greece withthe same fleet which he had before. With respect tothe two legions which remained in the city of Rome,no alteration was made. Leave was given for the con­suls to raise recruits, to complete the troops wherein.there was any deficiency of numbers. Twenty-one le­gions were employed this year in the service of theRoman empire. A charge was given to Publius Lici-nius Varus, city pretor, to repair thirty old ships ofwar, which lay at Ostia, and to furnish twenty newones, with their full complement of men, that he mighthave a fleet of fifty sail to guard the sea coasts in theneighborhood of Rome. Cains Calpurnius was for­bidden to remove his army from Arretium before thearrival of his successor. Both he and Tubero wereordered to be particularly watchful on that side, lestany new schemes might be formed.

all men directed their attention to (he consuls elect,and wished them, as speedily as possible, to cast lotsfor their provinces, that each of them might know be­forehand what province and what antagonist he was tohave. Measures were also taken in the senate, on amotion made by Quintus Fabius Maximus, to recon­cile them to each other; for there subsisted betweenthem an avowed enmity, which, on the side of Livms,was the more inveterate, as, during his misfortunes,he had felt himself treated with contempt by the other.He was therefore the more obstinately implacable, andinsisted, that ' there was no need of any reconcilia­tion: for they would conduct all business with thegreater diligence and activity, while each should beafraid, lest a colleague, who was his enemy, mightfind means of exalting his own character at the other'sexpense.' Nevertheless, the influence of the senateprevailed on them to lay aside their animosity, andto act with harmony and unanimity in the administra­tion of the government. The provinces allotted tothem were not, as in former years, a joint command inthe same districts, but quite separate, in the remotestextremities of Italy: to one, Bruttium and Lucania,where he was to act against Hannibal; to the other,Gaul, where he was to oppose Hasdrubal, who was nowsaid to be approachingto the Alps. It was ordered thatthe consul to whose lot Gaul fell should of the twoarmies (one of which was in Gaul, and the other inEtruria,) choose whichever he thought proper, and jointo it the city legions; and that he to whom the pro­vince of Bruttium fell should, after enlisting new le­gions for the city, take his choice of the armies com­manded by the consuls of the preceding year; andthat the army left by the consul should be given toQuintus Fulvius, proconsul, and that he should con­tinue in command for the year.

But the consul Marcellus was possessed withsuch a passionate desire for a trial of strength withHannibal, that he never thought his own camp closeenough to his; and on this occasion, as he was passingthe rampart, he left directions that every soldiershould be ready in his place, in order that, if the hillwhich they were going to examine, should be approvedof, the whole might strike their tents, and follow themthither. In front of the camp was a small plain, andthe road, leading thence to the hill, was open on allsides, and exposed to view. A watchman whom theNumidians had posted, not in expectation of an oppor­tunity so important as this, but with the hope of cut­ting off any party that might straggle too far in searchof wood or forage, gave them the signal to rise at oncefrom their concealments.

Though the consuls were sosituated in the valley that they could neither forcetheir way up the hill, which was occupied by theenemy, nor, surrounded as they were, effect a retreat,the dispute might nevertheless have been protractedfor a longer time, bad not the Etrurians began to fly,and thereby filled the rest with dismay. However, theFregellans, though abandoned by the Etrurians, didnot give up the contest, as long as the consuls re­mained unhurt; who, by their exhortations, and theirown personal exertions, supported the spirit of the fight jbut, afterwards, seeing both the consuls wounded, andMarcellus pierced through with a lance, and fallinglifeless from his horse, then the few betook themselvesto flight, carrying with them Crispinus, who had re­ceived two wounds from javelins, and young Marcel­lus, who was also hurt.

Headds, that during the battle a temple was vowed toJupiter in case of success. The other historians, bothGreek and Latin, (all those at least whose accounts Ihave read,) affirm, that nothing memorable was doneby Villius, and that Titus Quintius the consul, whosucceeded him, found that no progress whatever hadbeen made in the business of the war.
7. During the time of these transactions in Macedo­nia the other consul, Lucius Lentulus, who had stayedat Rome, held an assembly for the election of censors.Out of many illustrious men who stood candidates,were chosen Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus andPublius jElius Pastus. These, acting together in per­fect harmony, read the list of the senate without pass­ing a censure on any one member: they also let tofarm the port-duties at Capua, and those at the fort ofPuteoli, situate where the city now stands; inrollingfor this latter place three hundred colonists, that beingthe number fixed by the senate: they also sold thelands of Capua, which lie at the foot of Mount Tifata.About the same time Lucius Manlius Acidinus, on hisreturn from Spain, was hindered from entering thecity in ovation by Marcus Portius Laeca, plebeian tri­bune, notwithstanding he had obtained permission ofthe senate: coming then into the city in a privatecharacter, he conveyed to the treasury one thousandtwo hundred pounds weight of silver, and about thirtypounds' weight of gold.

they came to a resolution of sending as ambassadors tohim Marcus Valerius Lasvinus, who had been twiceconsul, and had commanded in Greece; Marcus Cae-cilius Metellus, who had been pretor; Servius Sulpi-cius Galba, who had been edile; and two who hadbeen questors, Caius Tremellius Flaccus and MarcusValerius Falto. A convoy of five quiuqueremes wasordered for them, that they might appear with suit­able grandeur in those countries where they wished toprocure a respect for the Roman name. The ambassa­dors in their way to Asia, having landed and gone toDelphi to the oracle, inquired what hopes might beentertained of accomplishing the business on whichthey had been sent: they were answered, it is said,that ' they would obtain what they were in search ofby means of king Attalus; and that when they shouldhave carried the goddess to Rome, they were to takecare that the best man in the city was the exerciser ofthe laws of hospitality towards her.' On coming tothe king at Pergamus, he received them kindly, con­ducted them to Pessinus in Phrygia, delivered to themthe sacred stone, which the natives said was the mo­ther of the gods, and desired them to convey it toRome. Marcus Valerius Falto, being sent homewardbefore the rest, brought an account that they were re­turning with the goddess; and that the best man inRome must be sought out to pay her the due rites ofhospitality. Quintus Caecilius Metellus was, by theconsul in Bruttium, nominated dictator, for the pur­pose of holding the elections, and his army was dis­banded. Lucius Veturius Philo was made master ofthe horse. The elections were held by the dictator:the consuls elected were Marcus Cornelius Cethegusand Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, the latter absent,being employed in the province of Greece. The pre-tors were then elected: Tiberius Claudius Nero, Mar­cus Marcius Rolla, Lucius Scribonius Libo, and Mar­cus Pomponius Matho. As soon as the elections werefinished, the dictator resigned his office. The Romangames were repeated thrice, the plebeian seven times.

reans universally excel all others. Such a quantity,therefore, of stones was poured, like the thickest hailon the fleet as it approached the land that, not daringto enter the harbor, the Carthaginians tacked aboutto the main. They then passed over to the smaller ofthe Baleares, which is equally fertile in soil, though,as already noted, of lesser strength. Here they landed,and pitched their camp in a strong post, over the har­bor, taking possession of the city and country withouta contest. Then, having enlisted two thousand auxili­aries, and sent them to Carthage for the winter, theyhauled their ships on shore. After Mago had departedfrom the coast, the people of Gades surrendered to theRomans.
38. Such were the transactions in Spain under theconduct and command of Publius Scipio; who, havingcommitted the charge of the province to Lucius Lentu-lus and Lucius Manlius Audinus, returned to Romewith ten ships; and having obtained an audience ofthe senate in the temple of Bellona, without the city,made a recital of his services in Spain, how often hehad engaged the enemy in pitched battles, how manytowns he had taken, and what nations he had reducedunder the dominion of the Roman people; that 'hehad gone into Spain against four generals, and fourarmies, who were elated with victory; and that he hadnot left a Carthaginian in all that country.' On ac­count of these exploits, he rather made trial how farhe might hope for a triumph than pushed for it withany earnestness; because it was well known that noone had ever been honored with it for achievementsperformed, unless invested with a public office. Whenthe senate was dismissed he proceeded into the city,and carried before him to the treasury fourteen thou­sand three hundred and forty-two pounds weight ofsilver, and of coined silver a great sum. Lucius Ve-turius Philo then held the assembly for electing con­suls; and all the centuries, with extraordinary marksof attachment, named Publius Scipio consul.

The shout on the side of the Romans was composed ofthe same sounds uttered by every one; consequentlyit was the stronger and more terrible: on the otherside, the sounds were dissonant, uttered in the dis­cordant languages of many different nations. Be­sides, the Roman manner of fighting was steady,being accustomed to press against the enemy withtheir own weight, and that of their arms. That of theCarthaginian was more loose, with greater agility thanstrength. Immediately, therefore, at the first onset,the Romans made the line of the enemy give way;and then, thrusting against them with their elbows andthe bosses of their shields, and stepping forward intothe place from which they had pushed them, theyrapidly gained ground. The rear ranks also, on per­ceiving the enemy's line shrink, pushed forward thosewho were before them, which greatly increased theirforce in repelling the enemy. On the other side, theAfricans and Carthaginians, so far from supporting theauxiliaries, who were giving way, drew back; fearinglest, if that first line made an obstinate resistance, theenemy in cutting through those, might close with them.The auxiliaries therefore quickly turned their backs,and facing about to their own party, some of them re­treated into the second line; others, who were not re­ceived there, made use of their arms against them,enraged at not having been supported before, and atbeing now excluded. So that there were, in a man­ner, two battles carried on together; the Carthagi­nians being obliged to engage in fight, and at the sametime, both with their mercenaries and with the Ro­mans. They did not, however, admit those cravensoldiers into their line, which was still firm and fresh;but, closing the ranks, drove them off to the wings,and to the open plains round the field of battle. Theplace where the auxiliaries had lately stood was filledup with such a number of slain, and such a quantityof arms, that it was rather more difficult to make waythrough them, than it had been through the body oftroops; the spearmen, however, who were in the van,liv. vol. v. s

16. About the time that Quintius first pitched hiscamp opposite to Philip's, and at the entrance of Epi-rus, Lucius, the consul's brother, whom the senate hadcommissioned both to the naval command and to thegovernment of the coast, sailed over with two quinque-remes to Corcyra; and when he learned that the fleethad departed thence, thinking any delay improper, hefollowed, and overtook it at the island of Zama. Herehe dismissed Luci us Apustius, in whose room he had beenappointed, and then proceeded to Ma lea, but at a slowrate, being obliged, for the most part, to tow the vesselswhich accompanied him with provisions. From Malea,after ordering the rest to follow with all possible expe­dition, himself, with three light quinqueremes, hastenedforward to the Piraeus, and took under his command theships left there by Lucius Apustius, lieutenant-general,for the protection of Athens. At the same time two fleetsset sail from Asia; one of twenty-four quinqueremes,under king Attalus; the other belonging to the Rhodians,consisting of twenty decked ships, and commanded byAgesimbrotus. These fleets, joining near the island ofAndros, sailed for Euboea, to reach which place theyhad only to cross a narrow channel. They first ravagedthe lands belonging to Carystus ; but, judging that citytoo strong, in consequence of a reinforcement hastilysent from Chalcis, they bent their course to Eretria.Lucius Quintius also, on hearing of the arrival of kingAttalus, came thither with the ships which had lain atthe Pirasus, having left orders that his own shipsshould as they arrived foll6w him to Euboea. Thesiege of Eretria was now pushed forward with the ut­most vigor; for the three combined fleets carried ma­chines and engines of all sorts, for the demolition oftowns, and the adjacent country offered abundance oftimber for the construction of new works.

BOOK XXVII.
Chap. 1. Such was the state of affairs in Spain. InItaly the consul Marcellus, after regaining possessionof Salapia, which was betrayed into his hands, tookby storm Maronea and Meles, cities belonging to theSamnites. He made prisoners three thousand of Han­nibal's soldiers, left in garrison: the booty, which wasconsiderable, was given up to the soldiers: here werefound, also, two hundred and forty thousand pecks ofwheat, and one hundred and ten thousand of barley.But the joy occasioned hereby was much less than thegrief felt for an overthrow a few days after, near thecity of Herdonea. Cneius Fulvius, proconsul, laythere encamped, in hopes of recovering that city,which, after the defeat at Cannas, had revolted fromthe Bomans; but his post was neither strong by na­ture, nor secured by proper guards. The negligencenatural to that commander's disposition was increasedby perceiving that the inhabitants, as soon as theyheard that Hannibal, after the loss of Salapia, hadwithdrawn from that part of the country into Bruttium,began to waver in their attachment to the Carthagi­nians. Intelligence of all these particulars was con­veyed to Hannibal by private messengers from Herdo­nea; and, while it made him anxious to preserve anallied city, at the same time inspired hopes of attack­ing the enemy unprepared.

clear day he despatched all the cavalry and light in­fantry, with orders to charge the Carthaginian outposts;and immediately advanced himself with the heavy bodyof the legions, having, contrary to the expectation bothof his own men and the enemy, strengthened the wingswith his Roman troops, and drawn the allies into thecentre. Hasdrubal was alarmed by the shout of thecavalry, and, springing out from his tent, saw a bustlebefore the rampart, his men in hurry and confusion,the glittering standards of the legions at a distance,and the plain filled with troops. He immediately de­spatched all his cavalry against that of the enemy,marching himself from out of the camp with the bodyof infantry; but, in drawing up his line, he made noalteration in the original disposition. The contest be­tween the horse had continued a long time doubtful,nor could they decide it by their own efforts, because,when either were repulsed, which happened to both inturn, they found a safe refuge among the infantry.But, when the armies had approached within five hun­dred paces of each other, Scipio, giving the signal forretreat, and opening his files, received all the cavalryand light troops through them; and, forming them intwo divisions, placed them in reserve behind the wings.When he saw that it was time to begin the engage­ment, he ordered the Spaniards who composed thecentre to advance with a slow pace, and sent directionsfrom the right wing, where he commanded in person,to Silanus and Marcius, to extend their wing on theleft, in the same manner as they should see him stretch­ing on the right, and attack the enemy with the light-armed forces of horse and foot before the centre couldclose. The wings extending in this manner, three co­horts of foot, and three troops of horse from each, to­gether with the light infantry, advanced briskly againstthe enemy, while the rest followed them in an obliquedirection. There was a bending in the centre, becausethe battalions of Spaniards advanced slower than thewings, and the wings had already encountered, whilethe principal strength of the enemy's line, the Cartha-

men's natural disposition was such, that they showedrather a dislike to the commission of faults, than suffi­cient resolution to punish them, when committed.' Thisrelieved the pretor and council from a heavy hurden,that of inquiring into the conduct of Scipio. They con­demned Pleminius, with thirty-two others, whom theysent in chains to Rome; and then proceeded to Scipio,that, witnessing all matters, they might carry certaininformation to Rome as to the truth of those reportswhich had been propagated concerning his manner ofliving, inactivity, and total relaxation of military dis­cipline.
22. While they were on their way to Syracuse, Sci­pio prepared, not words, but facts, to clear himself ofany charges in the remission of duty. He ordered allthe troops to assemble in that city, and the fleet to begot in readiness, as if, on that day, there was to be anengagement with the Carthaginians both on land andsea. On the arrival of the commissioners, he gavethem a kind reception and entertainment, and nextday showed them both the land and naval forces, notonly marshalled in exact order, but the former per­forming their evolutions, and the fleet in the harborexhibiting a representation of a naval combat. Thepretor and deputies were then led round to take a viewof the armories, granaries, and other warlike prepara­tions: and with such admiration were they struck, ofeach in particular, and of the whole together, as to be­come thoroughly persuaded that the Carthaginianswould be vanquished by that general and that army,or by no other. They desired him to set out on hisvoyage, with the blessing of the gods; and to fulfil, assoon as possible, the hopes of the Roman people,—those hopes which they had conceived on that day,when all the centuries concurred in naming him firstconsul: saying this, they left the place, and with asmuch joy as if they were to carry to Rome the news ofa victory, not of a grand preparation for war.

They there­fore repaired the walls, and strengthened them withoutworks; every one exerting himself, in bringing infrom the country such things as were requisite forsustaining a long and powerful siege. Little mentionwas made of peace; very many advised that a deputa­tion should be sent to recall Hannibal; but the greaternumber were earnest for despatching the fleet, (whichliad been equipped for the purpose of intercepting theconvoys,) to surprise the ships stationed at Utica,where no attack was expected; alleging the probabi­lity that they might, at the same time, make them­selves masters of the naval camp, which had been leftwith a slight guard. This latter scheme met generalapprobation; but, at the same time, they determinedto call Hannibal home, because, should the fleet meetwith all possible success, Utica would, indeed, be re­lieved from some part of the pressure of the siege;but, for the defence of Carthage itself, there was nowno general remaining but Hannibal, and no army buthis. The ships were therefore launched on the follow­ing day; at the same time the deputies set out forItaly, and, the juncture being critical, every measurewas executed with the utmost despatch; each manthinking, that if he were in any degree remiss, he wasso far a betrayer of the public safety. Scipio led onhis forces by slow marches, as they were heavilyloaded with the spoils of many cities. After sendingthe prisoners and other booty to his old camp at Utica,directing his views to Carthage, he seized on Tunes,which was defenceless, the garrison having fled. Thiscity was very strong, both by nature and art: it maybe seen from Carthage, from which it is distant aboutfifteeu miles, and at the same time affords a prospectof that city and the adjacent sea.

field of Mars, before he called on the centuries to givetheir votes, required their attention, and addressedthem thus :—' Citizens, you seem to me not to under­stand that the question before you is not whether youchoose to have peace or war; for Philip, having al­ready commenced hostilities wilh a formidable force,both on land and sea, allows you not that option. Thequestion is, whether you choose to transport your le­gions to Macedonia, or to suffer the enemy to comeinto Italy? How important the difference is betweenthese two cases, if you knew it not before, you havesufficiently learned in the late Punic war: for who en­tertains a doubt, but if, wben the Saguntines were be­sieged, and implored our protection, we had assistedthem with vigor, as our fathers did the Mamertines,we should have averted the whole weight of the war onSpain; which, by our dilatory proceedings, we suf­fered to our extreme loss to fall on Italy? Nor doesit admit a doubt, that what confined this same Philipin Macedonia, (after he had entered into an engage­ment with Hannibal*, by ambassadors and letters, tocross over into Italy,) was, our sending Laevinus witha fleet to carry the war home to him. And what wedid at that time, when we had Hannibal to contendwith in Italy, do we hesitate to do now, after Hannibalhas been expelled Italy, and the Carthaginians sub­dued? Suppose for an instant that we allow the kingto experience the same inactivity on our part, whilehe is taking Athens, as Hannibal found while he wastaking Saguntum: it will not be in the fifth month, asthe Carthaginian came from Saguntum, but on thefifth day after the Macedonian sets sail from Corinth,that he will arrive in Italy. Perhaps you may notconsider Philip as equal to Hannibal, or the Macedo­nians to the Carthaginians: certainly, however, youwill allow him equal to Pyrrhus. Equal, do I say?what a vast superiority has the one man over theother—the one nation over the other!

parts with great slaughter, the Gauls quickly turnedtheir backs, and fled to their camp in hurry and con­fusion. The cavalry pursued them; and the legions,coming up in a short time after, assaulted the camp,from whence there did not escape so many as sixthousand men. There were slain and taken abovethirty-five thousand, with eighty standards, and abovetwo hundred Gallic waggons laden with booty of allkinds. Hamilcar, the Carthaginian general, fell thatday, and three distinguished generals of the Gauls.The prisoners taken at Placentia, to the number oftwo thousand free men, were restored to the colony.
22. This was an important victory, and caused greatjoy at Rome. On receipt of the pretor's letter, a sup­plication for three days was decreed. In that battlethere fell of the Romans and allies two thousand, mostof them in the right brigade, against which, in the firstonset, the most violent efforts of the enemy had beendirected. Although the pretor had brought the waralmost to a conclusion, yet the consul, Cneius Aure-lius, having finished the business which required hisattendance at Rome, set out for Gaul, and receivedthe victorious army from the pretor. The other con­sul arriving in his province towards the end of autumn,passed the winter in the neighborhood of Apollonia.Caius Claudius, and the Roman triremes which hadbeen sent to Athens from the fleet that was laid up atCorcyra, as was mentioned above, arriving at Piraeus,greatly revived the hopes of their allies, who were be­ginning to give way to despair. Their arrival not onlyput a stop to the inroads by land, which used to bemade from Corinth through Megara, but so terrifiedthe pirates from Chalcis, who had been accustomed toinfest both the Athenian sea and coast, that they darednot venture round the promontory of Sunium, nor eventrust themselves out of the straits of the Euripus. Inaddition to these came three quadriremes from Rhodes,the Athenians having three open ships, which they hadequipped for the protection of their lands on the coast.While Claudius thought, that if he were able with his

dismissed, accounts were brought, that the Carthagi­nian ambassadors, who were coming to treat of peace,had been seen at Puteoli, and would proceed fromthence by land; on which the senate resolved, thatCaius Laelius should be recalled, in order that he mightbe present at the proceedings. Quintus Fulvius Gillo,a lieutenant-general under Scipio, conducted the Car­thaginians to Rome, but they were forbidden to enterthe city. Apartments were provided for them in theVilla Publica, and an audience of the senate wasgranted them in the temple of Bellona. Their dis­course was nearly the same with that which they hadmade to Scipio, throwing off all the blame of the warfrom the community, and laying it on Hannibal. Theyaffirmed, that ' he had acted contrary to the orders ofthe senate, not only in passing the Alps, but even incrossing the Iberus; and that he had, without any au­thority from them, made war not only on the Romans,but before that on the Saguntines; that, if the factswere duly considered, the senate and people of Car­thage had, to that day, inviolably observed the treatywith the Romans. Therefore they had nothing fartherin charge, than to request, that they might be allowedto abide by the terms of the peace which had beenlately concluded with the consul Lutatius.' The pre-tor, according to the established custom, giving per­mission to the senators to make such inquiries of theambassadors as any of them thought proper; the oldermembers, who had been present at the concluding ofthe treaties, asked various questions relative to them.The Carthaginians replied, that they were not of anage to remember particulars (for almost all of themwere young): on which, the house resounded with ex­clamations, that Punic faith was evident, in appointingsuch men as these to solicit the renewal of a formerpeace, with the terms of which they were themselvesunacquainted.

Philip, leav­ing a garrison in Abydus, returned to his kingdom;and, just when he had been encouraged by the de­struction of the people of Ahydus, to proceed in thewar against Rome, as Hannibal had been by the de­struction of Saguntum, he was met by couriers, withintelligence that the consul was already in Epirus, andhad drawn his land forces to Apollonia, and his fleet toCorcyra, into winter quarters.
19. In the mean time the ambassadors who had beensent into Africa, on the affair of Hamilcar, the leaderof the Gallic army, received from the Carthaginiansthis answer: that ' it was not in their power to domore than to inflict on him the punishment of exile,and to confiscate his effects; that they had deliveredup all the deserters and fugitives, whom, on a diligentinquiry, they had been able to discover, and wouldsend ambassadors to Rome, to satisfy the senate onthat head.' They sent two hundred thousand measuresof wheat to Rome, and the same quantity to the armyin Macedonia. From thence the ambassadors pro­ceeded into Numidia, to the kings; delivered to Ma-sinissa the presents and the message according to theirinstructions, and out of two thousand Numidian horse­men which he offered, accepted one thousand. Masi-nissa superintended in person the embarkation ofthese, and sent them, with two hundred thousand mea­sures of wheat, and the same quantity of barley, intoMacedonia.

Whatfright is this? What terror, what forgetfulness bothof your own character and that of your adversaries,has at once seized your minds? Surely they are thesame enemies, in defeating and pursuing of whom youspent the whole of the last summer; who for somedays past have fled before you night and day, whiteyou pressed on their rear; whom yesterday you didnot allow either to continue their march, or to formtheir camp. I say nothing of the advantages on whichyou ought to pride yourselves; but will mention what,of itself, ought to fill you with shame and remorse:yesterday you fought it out to the end on equal terms.What alteration has last night, what has this daymade? Have your forces been diminished; have theirsbeen augmented? I cannot persuade myself that I amspeaking to my own army, or to Roman soldiers. Thearms and appearances of the men are such as usual.But, if yon had possessed the usual spirit, would theenemy have seen your backs?

Thehottest part of the action was at the station where theking commanded; for the guard there was, in numbersboth of horse and foot, almost a complete army; and,as they were posted on the middle road, the greatestnumber of the Romans fell in with them. The Mace­donians had also the advantage in this, that the kinghimself was present to encourage them; and the Cre­tan auxiliaries, fighting in good order, and in a stateof preparation, against troops disordered and irregular,wounded many at a distance, where no such dangerwas apprehended. If they had acted with prudence inthe pursuit, they would have secured an advantage ofgreat importance, not only in regard to the glory ofthe present contest, but to the general interest of thewar; but, greedy of slaughter, and following with toomuch eagerness, they fell in with the advanced cohortsof the Romans under the military tribunes. The horse­men who were flying, as soon as they saw the ensignsof their friends, faced about against the enemy, now indisorder; so that in a moment's time the fortune of thebattle was changed, those now turning their backs whohad lately been the pursuers. Many were slain inclose fight, many in the pursuit; nor was it by thesword alone that they perished; several being driveninto morasses were, together with their horses, swal­lowed up in the deep mud. The king himself was indanger; for his horse falling, in consequence of awound, threw him headlong to the ground, and he verynarrowly escaped being overpowered before he couldrecover his feet. He owed his safety to a trooper,who instantly leaped from his horse, on which hemounted the affrighted king; himself, as he could notrun so fast as to keep up with the horsemen, was slainby the enemy, who had collected about the place wherePhilip fell.

should take a few days to himself to gain some know-lege of the enemy. Nero, with the utmost earnestness,iutreated them not, 'by delays, to render his enter­prise rash in effect, when dispatch would insure itssuccess. In consequence of a deception, which couldnot last long, Hannibal lay yet, in a manner, motion­less; he neither assailed his camp, left as it was with­out its commander, nor moved a step in pursuit ofhim. Before he should stir Hasdrubal's army mightbe cut off, and he himself might return into Apulia.Whoever, by procrastination, allowed time to the ene­my, would thereby betray the other camp to Hannibal,and open for him a road into Gaul, so as to enablehim at bis leisure to effect a junctioti with Hasdrubal,and whenever he pleased. They ought to give the sig­nal instantly, march out to battle, and to take everyadvantage of the delusion under which the enemy lay,both the party in their neighborhood, and the other ata distance, while the latter knew not that their oppo­nents were decreased in number, nor the former thattheirs were become more numerous and powerful.'Accordingly the council was dismissed, the signal ofbattle was displayed, and the troops immediatelymarched out to the field.

The only thing thatprevented an immediate engagement was, that Hasdru­bal having, with a few horsemen, advanced before theline, remarked among the enemy some old shields,which he had not seen before, and horses leaner thanany he had hitherto observed; their number also seemedgreater than usual. On which, suspecting what wasthe case, he hastily sounded a retreat; sent a party tothe watering place at the river, with orders to pick up,if possible, some prisoners; also to observe attentivelywhether there were any whose complexions were moresun-burned than usual, as from a journey lately made:at the same time, ordering another party to ride roundthe camp, at a distance, to mark whether the ramparthad been extended on any side, and to watch whether

The tribunes thought it reason­able that, as the right had been suffered to fall intodisuse through the inattention of former flamens, theinjury ensuing should affect only themselves, and notthe office; and accordingly, without any oppositionfrom the pretor himself, and with the universal appro­bation of the senate and commons, they introduced theflamen to a seat in the senate, though all men were ofopinion that his having attained his object was owingto the strict integrity of his conduct rather than to anyprivilege of the priesthood. The consuls, before theydeparted for their provinces, raised two city legions,and such a number of soldiers as was necessary tomake up the complement of the other armies. Theforce which hitherto had served in the city the consulFulvius gave to his brother Caius Fulvius Flaccus,lieutenant-general, with orders to march it into Etruria,and to bring home to Rome the legions then in thatprovince. The other consul, Fabius, having collectedthe relics of Fulvius' army, which amounted to threethousand three hundred and thirty-six men, orderedhis son Quintus Maximus to conduct them into Sicily,to the proconsul Marcus Valerius, and to receive fromhim the two legions and thirty quinqueremes. The re­moval of these legions out of the island made no dimi­nution, in respect either of strength or appearance, inthe force stationed in that province: for, besides twoveteran legions, completely recruited to their full com­plement, the proconsul had a great multitude of Nu-midian deserters, both horse and foot, and he also en­listed in his service those Sicilians who had served inthe army of Epicydes, and that of the Carthaginians,men well experienced in war. By annexing a part ofthese foreign auxiliaries to each of the Roman legions,he preserved the appearance of two armies; with oneof which he ordered Lucius Cincius to guard that partof the island which was formerly the kingdom of Hiero;

24. Scipio was seized with a severe fit of sickness;and the danger being magnified by report, (every one,through the natural propensity to exaggeration, add­ing something to what he had heard,) the whole pro­vince, more especially the distant parts of it, werethrown into disorder; which showed what importantconsequences must have attended the real loss of him,when the rumor of his illness alone could excite suchstorms. Neither the allies continued faithful, nor thearmy obedient to command. Mandonius and Indibilis,who had entertained confident expectations that, on theexpulsion of the Carthaginians, the dominion of Spainwould fall into their hands, being intirely disappointedin all their hopes, called together their countrymen ofLaceta and Illiturgi; sent for the young men of Celti-beria to assist them, and carried hostilities and devas­tation into the territories of the Suessetanians and Se-detanians, allies of the Roman people. Another com­motion arose in the camp at Sucro, where there wereeight thousand Romans stationed to secure the obedi­ence of the nations bordering on the Iberus. Theirdisposition to mutiny did not take its rise from the un­certain accounts of the general's life being in danger;it had sprung up some time before, from the licentious­ness incident to a long state of inaction, and partlyfrom their circumstances being straitened during peace,having been accustomed during the war to live moreplentifully on plunder. At first they only expressedtheir dissatisfaction in private discourses: 'If therewas a war in the province, what business had theythere, among people who were at peace? If the warwas already ended, why were they not carried back toItaly?' They also demanded their pay with a peremp-toriness unbecoming the condition of soldiers, whilethose on guard used to throw out abuse on the tribunesas they went their nightly rounds.

them; while, on their side, not only the soldiers, buta multitude of servants mixed among the troops, as­sailed the enemy with stones, which they found everywhere scattered, and which, in general, were of sucha size as that they could be thrown by the hand. Butthough the ascent was difficult, and they were almostoverwhelmed with darts and stones, yet, through theskill which they had acquired by practice in climbingwalls, and the obstinacy of their courage, the foremostgained the summit. When they got on ground thatwas any way level, and where they could stand withfirm footing, they soon beat back the enemy; who,though light and fit for skirmishing, and able enoughto defend themselves at a distance, while an uncertainkind of fight was waged with missive weapons, yet,when the matter came to close fighting, were quite de­ficient in steadiness; so that they were driven withgreat slaughter into the line of troops posted on thehigher eminence. On this Scipio, ordering the con­querors to press forward against their centre, dividedthe rest of the forces w^th Laelius, whom he ordered togo round the hill to the right, until he should find agentler ascent, while he himself, making a small cir­cuit to the left, charged the enemy in flank. This atonce threw their line into disorder, though they at­tempted to change the position of their wings, and toface about their ranks towards the several shouts whichassailed their ears from every quarter. During thisconfusion Laslius also came up, and the enemy by re­treating, through fear of being wounded from behind,broke their front line, and left an opening for the Ro­man centre, who never could have made their way upagainst ground so disadvantageous, had the ranks re­mained intire, and the elephants kept their posts in thefront of the battalions. While numbers were slain inevery quarter Scipio, who with his left wing hadcharged the right of the enemy, continued the attackwith the greatest fury against their naked flank.

they were among friends, they arrived at the placewhere the enemy lay, and pitched their tents at threemiles' distance from the Spanish camp. By sendingambassadors they endeavored to prevail on them tolay aside their arms, but in vain. Afterwards, theSpanish horsemen having made a sudden attack on theforagers of the Romans, and the latter sending sometroops to support them from one of their outposts,there ensued a battle between the cavalry, in whichneither side gained any considerable advantage.
3. At sunrise next day the whole force of the enemyappeared in arms, and drawn up in order of battle, atthe distance of about a mile from the Roman camp.The Ausetanians were in the centre, the Illergetiansformed the right wing, and people of several inconsi­derable Spanish states the left: between the wings andthe main body they had left very wide intervals, throughwhich the horse might charge on occasion. The Ro­mans drew up their army in the usual manner, yet sofar following the example of the enemy as to leavepassages open for the cavalry between the legions.Lentulus, however, considering that the horse couldbe of use only to that party which should first makean attack on the enemy's line, divided by the intervals,commanded Servius Cornelius, tribune of the soldiers,to order them to charge through the same. The fightbetween the infantry being rather unfavorable to theRomans at the beginning, he was obliged to delay fora time, while the thirteenth legion from the reservewas brought up to the first line, so as to support thetwelfth, which had been posted in the left wing againstthe Illergetians, and which began to give ground. Thefight being restored Scipio hastened to Lucius Manlius,who was exerting himself among the foremost batta­lions, encouraging and supporting his men by a supplyof fresh troops wherever occasion required, and ac­quainted him that matters were safe on the left wing,and that Cornelius Servius, whom he had despatchedfor the purpose, would quickly assail the enemy on allsides with his cavalry.

the country; and the guard, which they had left, wasvery insufficient; but he was apprehensive that his menwere too much fatigued by their hasty march. TheGauls, recalled from the fields by the shouts of theirparty, returned to the camp without seizing the bootywithin their reach, and, next day, marched out to offerbattle; the Roman did not decline the combat, but hadscarcely time to make the necessary dispositions, sorapidly did the enemy advance to the fight. The rightbrigade (for he had the troops of the allies dividedinto brigades) was placed in the first line, the two Ro­man legions in reserve. Marcus Furius was at thehead of the right brigade, Marcus Caecilius of the le­gions, and Lucius Valerius Flaccus of the cavalry:these were all lieutenants-general. Two other lieute­nants-general, Cneius Laetorius and Publius Titinnius,the pretor kept near himself, that, with their assistance,he might observe, and take proper measures againstany sudden attack. At first, the Gauls, bending theirwhole force to one point, were in hopes of being ableto overwhelm, and trample under foot, the right brigade,which was in the van; but not succeeding, they en­deavored to turn round the flanks, and to surroundtheir enemy's line, which, considering the multitudeof their forces, and the small number of the others,seemed easy to be done. On observing this, the pre­tor, in order to extend his own line, brought up thetwo legions from the reserve, and placed them on theright and left of the brigade which was engaged in thevan; vowing a temple to J.upiter, if he should on that dayprove victorious. To Lucius Valerius he gave ordersto make the horsemen of the two legions on one flank,and the cavalry of the allies on the other, charge thewings of the enemy, and not suffer them to come roundto his rear. At the same time, observing that the centreof their line was weakened, from having extended thewings, be directed his men to make an attack there inclose order, and to break through their ranks. Thewings were routed by the cavalry, and, at the sametime, the centre by the foot. Being worsted in all

ger hoping to decide the matter by a single battle, hebegan again to lay waste the lands, burn the houses,and storm the villages. At this time Clastidium wasburned, and the legions were led thence against theIlvatian Ligurians, who alone refused to submit. Thatstate also, on learning that the Insubrians had beendefeated in battle, and the Boians so terrified that theyhad not dared to risk an engagement, made a submis­sion. Letters from the consuls, containing accountsof their successes, came from Gaul to Rome at thesame time. Marcus Sergius, city pretor, read themin the senate, and afterwards, by direction of theFathers, in an assembly of the people; on which asupplication, of four days' continuance, was decreed.■—By this time winter had begun.
32. During the winter, while Titus Quintius, afterthe reduction of Elatia, had his troops cantoned inPhocis and Locris, a violent dissension broke out atOpus. One faction invited to their assistance thejEtolians, who were nearest at hand; the other theRomans. The jEtolians arrived first; but the otherparty, which was the more powerful, refused them ad­mittance, and, despatching a courier to the Romangeneral, held the citadel until he arrived. The citadelwas possessed by a garrison belonging to the king,and they could not be prevailed on to give it up, eitherby the threats of the people of Opus, or by the com­mands of the Roman consul. What prevented theirbeing immediately attacked was the arrival of an en­voy from the king, to solicit the appointing of a timeand place for a conference. This request was readilycomplied with; not that Quintius did not wish to seewar concluded under his own auspices, partly byarms, and partly by negotiation: for he knew notyet whether one of the new consuls would be sent totake the government in his room, or whether heshould be continued in the command; a point whichhe had charged his friends and relations to labor withall their might. But he thought that a conferencewould answer this purpose: that it would put it in his

posted bodies of armed men at the gates, and on therampart, and from this safe situation looked with adegree of confidence on the enemy, as long as theycontinued quiet. But, as soon as the troops of theMacedonians began to move, and to advance to therampart, in order of battle, and ready for an assault,they all quickly abandoned their posts, and fled throughthe opposite part of the camp, to the eminence wherethe Athamanians were stationed. During their flightin this confusion many of the jEtolians were slain,and many made prisoners. Philip doubted not that,had there been daylight enough remaining, he shouldhave been able to make himself master of the camp ofthe Athamanians also; but the day being spent in thefight, and in plundering the camp afterwards, he satdown under the eminence, in the adjacent plain, de­termined to attack the enemy at the first dawn. Butthe jEtolians, under the same apprehensions whichhad made them desert their camp, dispersed, and fledduring the following night. Amynander was of thegreatest service; for, by his directions, the Athama­nians, who were acquainted with the roads, conductedthem into jEtolia, whilst the Macedonians pursuedthem over the highest mountains through unknownpaths. In this disorderly flight a few, missing theirway, fell into the hands of the Macedonian horsemen,whom Philip, at the first light, on seeing the eminenceabandoned, had sent to infest them on their march.
43. About the same time also, Athenagoras, one ofthe king's generals, overtaking the Dardanians in theirretreat homeward, at first threw their rear into dis­order: but these unexpectedly facing about, and form­ing their line, the fight became like a regular engage­ment. When the Dardanians began again to advance,the Macedonian cavalry and light infantry harassedthose who had no troops of that kind to aid them, andwere, besides, burdened with unwieldy arms.

through the mediation of the people of Epirus; and acouncil, which was held for the purpose, having ap­pointed Pausanias the pretor, and Alexander the mas­ter of the horse, as negotiators, they brought the con­sul and the king to a conference, on the banks of theriver Aous, where the channel was narrowest. Thesum of the consul's demands was, that the king shouldwithdraw his troops from the territories of the severalstates; that to those whose lands and cities he hadplundered he should restore such of their effects ascould be found; and that the value of the rest shouldbe estimated by a fair arbitration. Philip answered,that 'the cases of the several states differed widelyfrom each other: that such as he himself had seizedon he would set at liberty; but he would not divesthimself of the hereditary and just possessions whichhad been conveyed down to him from his ancestors.If those, with whom hostilities had been carried on,complained of any losses in the war, he was ready tosubmit the matter to the arbitration of any state withwhom both parties were at peace.' To this the consulreplied, that 'the business required neither judge norarbitrator: for who did not see clearly that every in­jurious consequence of the war was to be imputed tothe first aggressor? And in this case Philip, unpro­voked by any, had first commenced hostilities againstall.' When they next began to treat of those nationswhich were to be set at liberty, the consul named,first, the Thessalians: on which the king indignantlyexclaimed, 'What harsher terms, Titus Quintius, couldyou impose on me, if I were vanquished?' With thesewords he retired hastily from the conference; and theywere prevented only by the river, which separatedthem, from assaulting each other with missile wea­pons. On the following day many skirmishes tookplace between parties sallying from the outposts, in aplain sufficiently wide for the purpose.

intermixed with other money; and that, unless thiswere done, the vow could not be fulfilled.' Althoughthe objection, and the person who proposed it, wereboth of weight, yet the consul was ordered to consultthe college of pontiffs, whether a vow could not be un­dertaken without specifying the amount to dischargeit? The pontiffs determined that it could; and that itwould be even more in order to do it in that way.The consul, therefore, repeating after the chief pontiff,made the vow in the same words in which those madefor five years of safety used to be expressed; only thathe engaged to perform the games, and make the offer­ings, at such expense as the senate should direct bytheir vote, at the time when the vow was to be put inact. Before this the great games, so often vowed,were constantly rated at a certain expense: this wasthe first time that the sum was not specified.
10. While every one's attention was turned to theMacedonian war, and at a time when people appre­hended nothing less, a sudden account was brought ofan inroad made by the Gauls. The Insubrians, Caeno-manians, and Boians, having been joined by the Saly-ans, Ilvatians, and other Ligurian states, and puttingthemselves under the command of Hamilcar, a Cartha­ginian, who, having been in the army of Hasdrubal,had remained in those parts, had fallen on Placentia;and, after plundering the city, and in their rage burn­ing a great part of it, leaving scarcely two thousandmen among the flames and ruins, passed the Po, andadvanced to plunder Cremona. The news of the cala­mity, which had fallen on a city in their neighborhood,having reached thither, the inhabitants had time toshut their gates, and place guards on the walls, thatthey might at least try the event of a siege, and sendmessengers to the Roman pretor. Lucius Furius Pur-pureo, who had then the command of the province,Lad, in pursuance of the decree of the senate, dis­banded the army, excepting five thousand of the alliesand Latine confederates, and had halted with thesetroops in the nearest district of the province about

rians of these intended measures, sent a party to lie inambush on the road from Tarentum. There, under thehill of Petellia, three thousand horsemen and twothousand foot were placed in concealment; and theRomans marching carelessly, without having examinedthe road, fell into the snare, where no less than twothousand soldiers were killed, and about twelve hun­dred taken prisoners: the rest flying different ways,through the fields and woods, returned to Tarentum.Between the Roman and Carthaginian camps stood ahill, interspersed with trees, which neither party atfirst had occupied, because the Romans knew not thenature of the ground on the side which faced the campof the enemy, and Hannibal had judged it to be betterfitted for an ambush than for a camp: accordingly hesect thither for the purpose a strong detachment ofNumidians, whom he concealed in the middle of athicket; not one of whom stirred from his post in theday, lest either their arms or themselves might be ob­served from a distance. There ran a general murmurthrough the Roman camp, that this hill ought to beseized and secured by a fort, lest, if Hannibal shouldget possession of it, they should have the enemy, as itwere, over their heads. The observation struck Mar-cellus, and he said to his colleague, 'Why not goourselves with a few horsemen, and take a view of theplace? After examining the matter with our own eyes,we shall be able to judge with more certainty.' Cris-pinus assenting, they proceeded to the spot, attendedby two hundred and twenty horsemen, of whom fortywere Fregellans, the rest Etrurians: they were ac­companied by two military tribunes, Marcus Mar-cellus, the consul's son, and Aulus Manlius, and by twoprefects of the allies, Lucius Arennius and MarcusAulius. Some writers have recorded that the consulMarcellus offered sacrifice on that day, and that onthe first victim being slain, the liver was found withoutits head; in the second, all the usual parts appeared,but there was a swelling observed on the head of theliver; the aruspex also observing, that in the second

ginian veterans and Africans, were still at such a dis­tance, that they could not throw their javelins witheffect, nor did they dare to make detachments to thewings, to support those who were engaged, for fear ofopening the centre to the forces advancing against it.The Carthaginian wings were hard pressed, being at­tacked on all sides; for the horse and foot, togetherwith the light infantry, wheeling round, fell in on theirflanks, while the cohorts pressed on them in front, inorder to separate the wings from the rest of the line.
15. The battle was now very unequal in all parts:not only because an irregular multitude of Baleariansand undisciplined Spanish recruits were opposed tothe Roman and Latine troops, but, as the day ad­vanced, Hasdrubal's troops began to grow faint, hav­ing been surprised by the alarm in the morning, andobliged to hasten out to the field before they couldtake food to support their strength. With a view tothis, Scipio had taken care to create delay, for it wasnot until the seventh hour that the battalions of footfell on the wings, and the battle reached the centresomewhat later; so that, before the enemy began regu­larly to engage, they were enfeebled by the heat of themeridian sun, the labor of standing under arms, andby hunger and thirst, distressing them at once. Theystood, therefore, leaning on their shields; for, in addi­tion to their other misfortunes, the elephants, terrifiedat the desultory manner of fighting used by the horseand the light infantry, had thrown themselves from thewings on the centre. Harassed thus greatly, both inbody and mind, they began to give way, but still pre­served their ranks as if the whole army were retreat­ing by order of the general. The victors perceivingthe superiority which they had gained, redoubled thefury of their assault on all sides, so that the shockcould hardly he sustained. Hasdrubal, however, en­deavored to stop his men, crying out that ' the hills inthe rear would afford a safe refuge, if they would butretreat without hurry;' yet fear overcame their shame,and although such as were nearest the enemy still con­

Romans placed their first-rank men behind the frontbattalions, consisting of the spearmen, and the veteransin reserve; posting the Italian cavalry on the rightwing, the Numidians and Masinissa on the left. Sy-phax and Hasdrubal, having placed their Numidiansopposite to the Italian cavalry, and the Carthaginiansopposite to Masinissa, drew the Celtiberians into thecentre of the line, facing the battalions of the legions:in this order they began the engagement. On the firstencounter both wings, Numidians and Carthaginians,were forced to give way: for neither could the Numi­dians, most of whom were undisciplined peasants, with­stand the Roman cavalry, nor the Carthaginians, whowere also raw soldiers, withstand Masinissa, who, be­sides other circumstances, was rendered terrible by hislate victory. The line of Celtiberians, (although, hav­ing lost the cover of the wings, they were exposed onboth flanks,) yet resolutely kept their ground ; for nei­ther could they see any safety in flight, being unac­quainted with the country, nor had they any hope ofpardon from Scipio, having come into Africa to fightagainst him for the sake of hire, notwithstanding thefavors which he had conferred on them and their na­tion. Surrounded therefore on all sides, they diedwith determined obstinacy, falling in heaps one overanother; and, while the attention of all was turned onthem, Syphax and Hasdrubal availed themselves ofthis opportunity, and gained a considerable space oftime to effect their escape. Night came on the con­querors, who were fatigued more with killing thanfrom the length of the contest.
9. Next day Scipio sent Latins and Masinissa, withall the Roman and Numidian cavalry, and the lightinfantry, in pursuit of Syphax and Hasdrubal. Hehimself, with the main body of the army, reduced allthe cities in that part of the country which belonged tothe Carthaginians, some by offering them hopes, othersby threats, others by force.

king kept himself quiet behind his intrenchments,he advanced close up to them, upbraiding him withcowardice; and as, notwithstanding, he still declinedan engagement, the consul, considering how dangerousforaging must be while the camps lay so near eachother, where the soldiers, dispersed through the coun­try, were liable to be suddenly attacked by the horse,removed his camp to a place called Octolophus, distantabout eight miles, where he could forage with moresafety. While the Romans were collecting corn inthe adjacent fields, the king kept his men within thetrenches, in order to increase both the negligence andconfidence of the enemy. But, when he saw themscattered, he set out with all his cavalry, and theauxiliary Cretans; and marching with such speed thatthe swiftest footmen could, by running, but just keepup with the horse, he took post between the camp ofthe Romans and their foragers. Then, dividing theforces, he sent one part of them in quest of the ma­rauders, with orders to give no quarter; with the other,he himself halted, and placed guards on the roadsthrough which he supposed the enemy would fly backto their camp. The slaughter and flight of the provi­sioning party had continued for some time on all sides,and no intelligence of the misfortune had yet reachedthe Roman camp, because those who fled towards thecamp fell in with the guards which the king had sta­tioned to intercept them, and greater numbers wereslain by those who were placed in the roads than bythose who had been sent out to attack them. At lengtha few effected their escape through the midst of theenemy's posts, but were so filled with terror, that theyexcited a general consternation in the camp, withoutbeing able to give any certain account of what wasgoing on.

(which was not surprising, as most of these fleets hadonly gone in quest of plunder), or even in any formerone. And yet his force could not be fully estimatedfrom a view of the present armament, for not only twoconsuls with their armies had passed from thence be­fore, but there had been almost as many war-vessels intheir fleets as there were transports attending Scipio.These, it is true, were not less than four hundred, butof ships of battle he had only fifty. But the Romanshad more alarming apprehensions from one war thanfrom the other; from the second, than from the former;as well by reason of its being waged in Italy, as of thedreadful destruction of so many armies, together withtheir commanders. Scipio, however, had attracted anextraordinary degree of attention. He had acquired ahigh degree of renown, partly by his bravery, partlyby the happy success which had attended it, and whichgave room to expect from him the most gloriousachievements. Besides, the very object proposed ofpassing into the enemy's country, which had not beenattempted by any general during that war, stronglyroused men's feelings; for he had on all occasionspublicly declared that his intention was to draw Han­nibal away from Italy, to transfer the war to Africa,and to finish it there. Not only the whole of the in­habitants of Lilybaeum crowded together to the harborto get a view of them, but also deputies from all partsof Sicily; who came for the purpose of showing thatmark of respect, not only to Scipio, but to MarcusPomponius, pretor of the province. The legions like­wise, which were to be left on the island, quitted theirquarters in compliment to their fellow-soldiers. In aword, the fleet exhibited a grand prospect to those onland, and the land to those on ship-board, it beingcovered all round with the admiring multitude.

of obtaining Africa: they therefore wished that Italyand Africa should be disposed of by lot: but this wasopposed, though by Quintus Metellns chiefly. Theconsuls were ordered to apply to the tribunes, to takethe sense of the people as to who should conduct thewar in Africa. All the tribes concurred in appointingPublius Scipio. Nevertheless the consuls put the pro­vince of Africa to the lot, for so the senate had de­creed, and it fell to Tiberius Claudius, who was tocarry to Africa a fleet of fifty ships, all quinqueremes,with authority equal to that of Scipio. Marcus Servi-lius obtained Etruria; and in the same province thecommand was continued to Caius Servilius, if the se­nate thought proper that the consul should remain inthe city. Of the pretors, Marcus Sextius obtainedGaul, where Publius Quintilius Varus was fo deliverto him two legions with the province; Cains Livins,Bruttium, with the two legions which Publius Sem-pronius, proconsul, had commanded the year before;Cneius Tremellius, Sicily, with directions to receivefrom Publius Villius Tappulus, pretor of the formeryear, the province and two legions; Villius, as pro-pretor, was appointed to protect the coast of Sicilywith twenty ships of war and one thousand troops;Marcus Pomponius, to convey from thence to Rome,with the remaining twenty ships, one thousand fivehundred soldiers. The city jurisdiction fell to CaiusAurelius Cotta: the rest were conlinued in their pro­vinces, and with the armies to which they were firstappointed. Not more than sixteen legions were em­ployed that year in the service of the empire. Inorder to conciliate the favor of the gods to all theirundertaking's and proceedings, it was ordered that theconsuls should, before they set out to the campaign,celebrate those games, and with the greater victims,which Titus Manlius, dictator, in the consulate of Mar­cus Claudius Marcellus and Titus Quintius, had vowed,provided the commonwealth should for the next fiveyears continue in the same state.

tedious if not difficult work, he marched hack his army.Unwilling, however, to leave the possession of all thatcountry to the Carthaginians, he sent his brother, Lu­cius Scipio, with ten thousand foot and one thousandhorse, to lay siege to the most considerable city inthose parts, called by the barbarians Orinx, situate onthe borders of the Milesians, a Spanish nation socalled—a desirable spot, the adjacent parts affordingmines of silver, and the soil being fruitful. This placeserved Hasdrubal as a fortress, whence he used tomake incursions on the states around. Scipio en­camped near to it. Before raising his works of cir-cumvallation, however, he sent some persons to thegates to try the disposition of the inhabitants in a con­ference, and to recommend to them rather to maketrial of the friendship than the power of the Romans.As their answers showed no inclination to peace, hesurrounded the city with a trench and a double ram­part; breaking his army into three parts, in order thatone division might always carry on the attack whilethe other two rested. When the first of these beganthe assault, the contest was furious and desperate: itwas with the greatest difficulty that they could ap­proach, or bring up the ladders to the walls, on ac­count of the showers of weapons which fell on them;and even of those who had raised them, some weretumbled down with forks made for the purpose, othersfound themselves in danger of being caught by irongrapples, and of being dragged up on the wall. WhenScipio saw that his men were too few to make an im­pression, and that the enemy, from the advantage oftheir works, had even the better of the dispute, hecalled off the first division, and attacked with the twoothers at once. This struck such terror into the be­sieged, already fatigued, that not only the townsmenquickly forsook the walls, but the Carthaginian gar­rison, fearing that the town had been betrayed, like­wise left their posts and collected themselves into abody.

Then the list of thenew senate was read, in which eight were left out,among whom was Lucius Caecilius Metellus, infamousfor having, after the defeat at Cannes, advised theabandonment of Italy. In their review of the eques­trian order also, they censured every one concernedwith him; but the number disgraced on that accountwas very small. From all the cavalry of the legionsof Cannae then in Sicily, and their number was great,their horses were taken away. To this they addedanother punishment in point of time ; ordering that thecampaigns which those men had served on horses givenby the public should not intitle them to release, butthat they should serve during ten others on horses oftheir own. They also searched for, and discovered, agreat number, who ought to be ranked in the cavalry;and all of these who had been seventeen years old atthe beginning of the war, and had not served, theydisfranchised. They then contracted for the repairsof the buildings round the forum, which had been de­stroyed by the fire,—seven shops, the shambles, andthe royal palace.
12. Having finished the necessary business at Rome,the consuls set out for the campaign. Fulvius, first,went forward to Capua; in a few days after Fabiusfollowed, and he earnestly intreated his colleague inperson, and Marcellus by letter, to make the mostvigorous efforts to keep Hannibal employed, while heshould carry on the siege of Tarentum; observing'that, when that city should be taken from the enemy,who was already repailsed in every quarter, and wouldthen have no place where ;he conld rest, or to which

fore retired from thence, and led back his troops intowinter quarters in Macedonia.
5. There, whilst others, glad of any interval of rest,consigned both body and mind to repose, Philip, inproportion as the season of the year had relieved himfrom the incessant fatigues of marching and fighting,found his care and anxiety increase the more, when heturned his thoughts towards the general issue of thewar. He dreaded, not only his enemies, who pressedhim hard by land and sea, but also the dispositions,sometimes of his allies, at others of his own subjects.The former, he thought, might be induced, by hopesof friendship with the Romans, to change sides, andthe Macedonians themselves be seized with a desire ofinnovation. Wherefore, he despatched ambassadorsto the Achasans, both to require their oath, (for it hadbeen made an article of their agreement that theyshould take an oath of fidelity to Philip every year,)and at the same time to restore to them Orchomenes,Heraa, and Triphylia. To the Megalopolitans he de­livered up Aliphera; which city, they insisted, hadnever belonged to Triphylia, but ought to be restoredto them, having been one of those that were incorpo­rated by the council of the Arcadians for the foundingof Megalopolis. These measures had the desired effectof strengthening his connexion with the Achaeans. Theaffections of the Macedonians he conciliated by histreatment of Heraclides: for finding that, from havingcountenanced this man, he had incurred the generaldispleasure of his subjects, he charged him with anumber of crimes, and threw him into chains, to thegreat joy of the people. In his preparations for war,he exerted the most vigorous efforts; exercised boththe Macedonian and mercenary troops in arms, and, inthe beginning of spring sent Athenagoras, with all theforeign auxiliaries and light troops, through Epirusinto Chaonia, to seize the pass at Antigonia, which theGreeks called Stena. He followed, in a few days, withthe heavy troops; and having viewed every situationin the country, he judged that the most advantageous

plains of Italy were pointed out as the reward of suc­cess. The Moors and Numidians he terrified with theprospect of cruel tyranny under Masinissa. Differentobjects of hope and fear were proposed to each; butto the Carthaginians, nothing but extremes, either onthe side of hope or of fear, was presented to view;the walls of their native city, their household gods,the sepulchres of their ancestors, their children, pa­rents, and wives distracted with terror; in a word,utter ruin and abject slavery, or the empire of theworld. While the general was thus employed amongthe Carthaginians, and the commanders of the severalnations among their respective countrymen, (many ofthem speaking by interpreters, being intermixed withforeigners,) the trumpets and cornets sounded on theside of the Romans; and such a shout was raised,that the elephants, particularly in the left wing, turnedabout against their own men, the Moors and Numi­dians. Masinissa, charging them while in disorder,easily drove them in, and stripped their line on thatflank of the cover of the cavalry. However, a few ofthese beasts unaffrighted, being driven forward on theRomans, made great slaughter among the light troops,but not without receiving many wounds; for springingback to the companies, and to avoid being troddenunder foot, opening a passage for the elephants, theydischarged their spears at them from both sides, beingintirely exposed as they passed through ; nor did thejavelins from the first line of troops cease until, beingdriven away from the Roman line by the weapons,showered on them, they put to flight even the Cartha­ginian cavalry in their own right wing. Ltelius, see­ing the enemy in this confusion, charged their dis­ordered troops, and put them to flight.

The Carthaginian line was exposed on bothflanks, not having cavalry to cover them, when theinfantry began to engage; but no longer on an equa­lity with the Roman, either in hope or in strength.There was another circumstance, which, though triflingin appearance, is yet of great consequence in action.

It was added to the decree, that ' if any per­son in future should make any proposal tending tothrow disgrace and ignominy on Philip, the people ofAthens would ratify it in its fullest extent: if, on thecontrary, any one should, by word or deed, endeavorto lessen his ignominy, or to do him honor, that who­ever slew such person should be justified in so doing.'Lastly, a clause was annexed, that 'all the decrees,formerly passed against the Pisistratidae, should be infull force against Philip.' Thus the Athenians wagedwar against Philip with writings and with words, inwhich alone their power consists.

BOOK XXVIII.
Chap. 1. At the time when, in consequence of Has-drubal's removing his forces, Spain seemed to be re­lieved of so much of the burden of the war as had beenthrown on Italy, hostilities suddenly revived therewith the same violence as before. The possessions ofthe Romans and Carthaginians in Spain, at that time,were thus situated: Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, had with­drawn quite to the ocean and Gades; the coast of oursea, and almost all that part of Spain which lies to theeastward, was under the power of Scipio, and the do­minion of the Romans. Hanno, the new general, whohad come over from Africa with a new army, in theroom of Hasdrubal Barcas, and joined Mago, havingquickly armed a great number of men in Celtiberia (aninland province, equidistant from both seas), Scipio,to oppose him, sent Marcus Silanus with only tenthousand foot and five hundred horse. Silanus pro­ceeded with all possible expedition; and though hismarch was impeded by the ruggedness of the roads,and by defiles surrounded with thick woods, which aremet with in most parts of Spain, yet, taking for guidessome of the natives, who bad deserted from Celtiberia,he came up with the Carthaginians before any mes­senger, or even any report of his approach, had reachedthem. From deserters he also receiyed information,when he was about ten miles distant from the enemy,that they had two camps, one on each side of the roadin which he was marching; that the Celtiberians, whowere newly raised forces, amounting to more than ninethousand men, formed the camp on the left, the Car­thaginians that on the right; that the latter was strong,and secured by outposts, watches, and every regularmilitary guard: the other disorderly, and negligentlyguarded, being composed of barbarians, who were butlately enlisted, and were under the less apprehensionbecause they were in their own country.

If that people saw the allies cordially unitingin such a measure, they certainly would think of makingpeace with the Carthaginians: otherwise, as long asHannibal lived, Italy would never be free from war.'Thus did they argue in their assemblies.

The consuls, surprised at suchan extraordinary declaration, and wishing to deter themfrom the meditated secession, to which end they sup­posed that censure and reproof would be more effectualthan gentle measures, answered, that ' the expressionswhich they had dared to use were such as the consulscould not prevail on themselves to repeat in the senate:for they contained not a refusal of military duty, butan open defection from the Roman people. They ad­vised them., therefore, to return home instantly to con­sult with their respective countrymen, as if no stephad yet been taken; since their infamous design,though disclosed in words, had not proceeded to ac­tion; and to remind them that they were not nativesof Campania, or of Tarentum, but of Rome. Thatfrom thence they derived their origin, and from thencewere sent out into colonies, into lands taken from ene­mies, for the purpose of increasing population; andthat, consequently, whatever duties children owe toparents, these they owed to the Romans, if they hadany remains of natural affection, or any regard fortheir mother country. They desired them, therefore,to confer on the matter anew; for that, as to the mea­sures which they had inconsiderately mentioned, theirtendency was to betray the Roman empire, and to giveup the conquest of it to Hannibal.'

Nextday, being introduced to the senate, he delivered theadvices with which he was charged, that Carthage, themetropolis of Spain, had been reduced in one day,several revolted cities brought back to obedience, andnew alliances formed with others. From the prisonersinformation was gained, corresponding, in general, withthat contained in the letter of Marcus Valerius Mes-sala. What gave the greatest uneasiness to the senate-was Hasdrubal's intended march into Italy, which wasscarcely able to withstand Hannibal, and the forcewhich he had already with him. Laelius also, comingout into the general assembly, gave a similar account.The senate, in consideration of the services performedby Publius Scipio, decreed a supplication for one day,and then ordered Caius Laelius to return with all expe­dition to Spain, with the ships which he had broughtthence. On the authority of a great many historians,I have fixed the taking of Carthage in this year, al­though I am not ignorant that several have placed it inthe year following; but it appeared to me very impro­bable that Scipio should have passed a whole year inSpain without doing any thing.

gance unbecoming a Grecian state, as by their wishesto prevent Philip from interfering in any of the affairsof Greece; an interference which would be highlydangerous to the general liberty. The deliberationsconcerning a pacification were adjourned to the meet­ing of the council of the Achaeans, and a certain timeand. place were fixed for that assembly. In the meantime a truce for thirty days was obtained. The king,proceeding thence through Thessaly and Boeotia, cameto Chalcis in Euboea, with design to exclude Attalusfrom the harbors and coasts, for intelligence had beenreceived that he intended to come to Euboea with afleet. .Afterwards, leaving there a body of troops tooppose Attalus, in case he should happen to arrive inthe mean time, and setting out himself with a fewhorsemen and light infantry, he came to Argos. Herethe superintendence of the games of Haerean Juno andNemasan Hercules being conferred on him by the suf­frages of the people, because the kings of the Macedo­nians affect to derive the origin of their family fromthat city, he performed those in honor of Juno; and,as soon as they were finished, went off instantly tojEgium, to the council summoned some time before.In this assembly several schemes were proposed forputting an end to the iEtolian war, that neither theRomans nor Attalus might have any pretence for en­tering Greece. But every measure of the kind wasdefeated at once by the jEtolians, when the time ofthe truce had scarcely expired, on their hearing thatAttalus was arrived at iEgina, and that the Romanfleet lay at Naupactus: for being called into the coun­cil of the Achasans, where were likewise present thesame ambassadors who had treated of a pacification atPhalara, they at first complained of some trifling actscommitted during the truce, contrary to the faith ofthe convention, at last declaring that the war couldnot be terminated on any other terms than by theAchaeans giving back Pylus to the Messenians, Atin-tania to the Romans, and Ardyasa to Scerdilaedus andPleuratus.

to Rome, he himself retired to Tarraco. During thesame year the Roman fleet, under Marcus ValeriusLaevinus, proconsul, sailing over from Sicily to Africa,made extensive devastations in the territories of Uticaand Carthage, carrying off plunder from the remotestbounds of the Carthaginian territory, even from underthe very walls of Utica. On their return to Sicilythey were met by a Carthaginian fleet, consisting ofseventy ships of war; seventeen of these they took,and sunk four; the rest were beaten and dispersed.The Romans, victorious by land and sea, returned toLilybaeum, with immense booty of every kind. Thesea being thus cleared of the enemy, abundance ofprovision was brought to Rome.
5. In the beginning of the summer during whichthese transactions passed Publius Sulpicius, procon­sul, and king Attalus, after having wintered at JEginaas mentioned above, united their fleets, consisting oftwenty-three Roman five-banked gallies, and thirty-five belonging to the king, and sailed from thence toLemnos. Philip also, that he might be prepared forevery sort of exertion, whether he should have occa­sion to oppose the enemy on land or sea, came down tothe coast of Demetrias, and appointed a day for hisarmy to assemble at Larissa. On the news of theking's arrival embassies from his allies came to Deme­trias from all sides; for the jEtolians, elated both bytheir alliance with the Romans, and by the approach ofAttalus, were ravaging the neighboring states. Notonly the Acarnanians, Uoeotians, and Euboeans, wereunder violent apprehensions, but the AchKans alsowere kept in terror, as well by the hostilities of the.iEtolians as by Machanidas, tyrant of Lacedaemon,who had pitched his camp at a small distance from theborders of the Argives. All these, representing thedangers both on land and sea with which their severalpossessions were threatened, implored the king's as­sistance.

linued to fight, they quickly turned their backs, andall betook themselves to a hasty flight. They haltedhowever for a time at the foot of the hills, endeavoringto restore order, while the Romans hesitated to ad­vance their line against the opposite steep. But, whenthey saw the battalions pressing forward briskly, theyrenewed their flight, and were driven in a panic withintheir works. The Romans were not far from the ram­part; and continuing their efforts, had nearly sur­mounted it, when such a quantity of rain poured sud­denly down, that it was with difficulty they regainedtheir camp. The sun, too, had been excessively hot,as is usually the case when shining forth from amongclouds surcharged with water; which added greatly tothe fatigues of the day. Some were even seized witha religious scruple against attempting any thing fartherat that time. Though both night and the rain invitedthe Carthaginians to take the repose so necessary tothem, yet fear and the impending danger would notadmit of it; and as they had reason to expect an as­sault from the enemy at the first light, they raised theheight of the rampart with stones collected from theadjacent valleys, endeavoring to secure themselves byfortifications, since they found no protection in theirarms. But the desertion of their allies soon gave themreason to think that it was the safer way to fly. Thebeginning of this revolt arose from Attanes, prince ofthe Turdetans, who deserted with a great number ofhis countrymen; and afterwards, two fortified towns,with their garrisons, were delivered to the Romans bytheir commanders. Hasdrubal, dreading, since a dis­position to throw off the Carthaginian yoke had onoeseized their minds, that the evil might spread farther,decamped during the silence of the ensuing night.

At the first light, the outgitards having broughtintelligence of the enemy's departure, Scipio, sendingforward the cavalry, gave orders to the army to march;and these were executed with such expedition that,bad they directly pursued the track of the fugitives,they had certainly overtaken them; but they were

was quickly followed by a war with Macedonia: a war,not to be compared with the former, indeed, either indanger, or in the abilities of the commanders, or thevalor of the soldiers ; but rather more remarkable withregard to the renown of their former kings, the ancientfame of that nation, and the vast extent of their em­pire, which formerly comprehended a large part ofEurope, and the greater part of Asia. The contestwith Philip, which had begun about ten years before,had been intermitted for the three last years, thejEtolians having been the occasion both of the com­mencement and of the cessation of hostilities. TheRomans being now disengaged from all employment,and being incensed against Philip, on account both ofhis infringing the peace with regard to the jEtolians,and the other allies in those parts, and also on accountof his having lately sent aid of men and money intoAfrica to Hannibal and the Carthaginians, were ex­cited to a renewal of the war by the intreaties of theAthenians, whose country he had ravaged, and shutup the inhabitants within the walls of the city.
2. About the same time ambassadors arrived bothfrom king Attalus, and from the Rhodians, with infor­mation that the Macedonian was tampering with thestates of Asia. To these embassies an answer wasgiven, that the senate would give attention to the affairsof Asia. The determination with regard to the makingwar on him was left open to the consuls, who werethen in their provinces. In the mean time,' threeambassadors were sent to Ptolemy, king of Egypt,namely, Caius Claudius Nero, Marcus jEmilius Lepi-dus, and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, to announcetheir conquest of Hannibal and the Carthaginians;to give thanks to the king for his faithful adherence tohis engagements in the time of their distress, wheneven the nearest allies of the Romans abandoned them;and to request that, if they should be compelled by illtreatment to break with Philip, he would preserve thesame disposition towards the Roman people.

Cneius who bad fallen in Spain, (a youth who had notyet obtained a questorship,) was the best of all the goodmen in Rome. If the authors who wrote in the timesnearest to this transaction, and when the memory of itwas fresh, had mentioned the particular merits whichinduced them to make this determination, I shouldgladly have handed down the information to posterity:but I will not obtrude any opinion of my own, formed,as it must be, on conjecture, when relative to a matterburied in the obscurity of remote antiquity. PubliusCornelius was accordingly ordered to repair to Ostia,to meet the goddess, attended by all the matrons; toreceive her himself from the ship, and then to deliverher to the said matrons, to be transported to the city.Scipio, falling down the river Tiber, as had been or­dered, received the goddess from the priests, and con­veyed her to the land. She was there received by theabove-mentioned women, and who were the principalof the city, among whom the name of Claudia Quintaalone has been distinguished; for her character, as issaid, having at one time been dubious, the share whichshe had in this solemn act of religion rendered herchastity no longer questionable, and she became illus­trious among posterity. Tlrese, relieving each otherin succession, carried this saving divinity into thetemple of Victory, on the Palatine hill, whilst all thecity poured out to meet her, censers being placed be­fore the doors, wherever the procession passed, andincense burned in them; all praying that she wouldenter the city with good-will, and a favorable disposi­tion. This happened on the day preceding the ides ofApril; and which was appointed a festival. The peo­ple in crowds carried presents to the goddess, andthere was a religious feast ordained, with games calledMegalesian.

40. The consuls, taking different routes, when settingout to open the campaign, drew the anxiety of the pub­lic in opposite directions, as if to two distinct wars atonce; for, besides their recollection of the heavy cala­mities which Hannibal's first coming had brought onItaly, people were farther distressed by doubts of theissue. 'What gods,' said they to themselves, ' wouldbe so propitious to the city, and to the empire, as togrant success to their arms in both quarters at the sametime? Hitherto the business had been protracted by acounterpoise of successes and misfortunes. When inItaly, at the Thrasymenus and Cannae, the Roman powerhad been crushed to the earth, a number of successfulefforts in Spain had raised it up from its fallen state:when afterwards, in Spain, a succession of defeats, inwhich two excellent commanders were lost, had, in agreat measure, ruined the two armies, the many ad­vantages gained by the Roman arms in Italy and Si­cily had afforded shelter to the shattered vessel of thestate. Besides, even the distance of place, one warbeing then carried on in the remotest extremity of theworld, allowed room to breathe: but now, two warshad penetrated into the very heart of Italy; two com­manders, of the most distinguished reputation, stoodon the opposite sides of the city of Rome; and thewhole mass of danger, the intire burden, pressed onone spot. Whichever of these commanders shouldfirst gain a battle, he would, in a few days after, joinhis camp with the other.' The preceding year, also,having been saddened by the deaths of the two consuls,served to augment the general apprehensions. Suchwere the melancholy forebodings which perplexed theminds of the people, as they escorted the commanderson their departure to their provinces.

At Frusino alamb was born with a swine's head; at Sinuessa, a pigwith a human head; and in Lucania, in the land be­longing to the state, a foal with five feet. All thesewere considered as horrid and abominable, and as ifNature were straying from her course in confoundingthe different species. Above all, the people were par­ticularly shocked at the hermaphrodites, which wereordered to be immediately thrown into the sea, as hadbeen lately done with a production of the same mon­strous kind, in the consulate of Caius Claudius andMarcus Livius. Not satisfied with this, they orderedthe decemvirs to inspect the books in regard of thatprodigy; and the decemvirs, from the books, directedthe same religious ceremonies which had been per­formed on an occasion of the same kind. They or­dered, besides, a hymn to be sung through the city bythrice nine virgins, and an offering to be made to im­perial Juno. The consul, Caius Aurelius, took carethat all these matters were performed according to thedirection of the decemvirs. The hymn was composedby Publius Licinius Tegula, as a similar one had been,in the memory of their fathers, by Livius.

All religious scruples were fully removed byexpiations: at Locri, too, the affair of the sacrilegehad been thoroughly investigated by Quintus Minu-cius, and the money replaced in the treasury out of theeffects of the guilty.

this occasion, the two commanders displayed greatsagacity in their proceedings, while one endeavored toeffect, the other to guard against deception. Hanni­bal had, with Marcellns' body, gotten possession of hisring, and Crispinus, fearing lest mistakes occasionedby means of this signet might give room to the Car­thaginian for practising some of his wiles, sent ex­presses round to all the neighboring states to informthem that ' his colleague had been slain, that the enemywas in possession of his ring, and that they should,therefore, give no credit to any letters writlen in thename of Marcellns.' This message from the consulhad but just arrived at Salapia, when a letter wasbrought thither from Hannibal, written in the name ofMarcellns, intimating that ' he would come to Salapiaon the night which was to follow that day; and direct­ing that the soldiers of the garrison should be ready invase he should have occasion to employ them.' TheSalapians were aware of the fraud; and judging thatHannibal, whom they had incensed, not only by theirdefection from his party, but by killing his horsemen,was seeking an opportunity for revenge, sent back hismessenger, who was a Roman deserter, in order thatthe Soldiers might act, as should be thought proper,without being watched by him; they then placed par­ties of the townsmen on guard along the walls, and inthe convenient parts of the city, forming the guardsand watches for that night with more than ordinarycare. On each side of the gate through which theyexpected the enemy to come they placed the mainstrength of the garrison. About the fourth watchHannibal approached the city: his vanguard was com­posed of Roman deserters, armed also in the Romanfashion. These, when they came to the gate, as theyall spoke the Latin language, called up the watch­men, and ordered them to open the gate, for the consulwas at hand.

But since necessity diverted my attentionfrom the guarding of it to this present war, the Thra­cians have possession of it. So much for the jEtolians.To Attalus and the Rhodians I in justice owe nothing;for not to me, but to themselves, is the commencementof hostilities to be attributed. However, out of respectto the Romans, I will restore Perae to the Rhodians,and to Attalus his ships, and such prisoners as can befound. As to what concerns Nicephorium, and thetemple of Venus, what other answer can I make tothose who require their restoration, than what I shouldmake in case of woods and groves cut down; that, asthe only way of restoring them, I will take on myselfthe trouble and expense of planting, since it is thoughtfit that, between kings, such kinds of demands shouldbe made and answered?' The last part of his speechwas directed to the Achaeans, wherein he enumerated,first, the kindnesses of Antigonus; then, his own to­wards their nation, desiring them to consider the de­crees themselves had passed concerning him, whichcomprehended every kind of honor, divine and human;and to these he added their late decree, by which theyhad confirmed the resolution of deserting him. He in­veighed bitterly against their perfidy, but told themthat nevertheless he would give them back Argos.'With regard to Corinth, he would consult with theRoman general; and would, at the same time, inquirefrom him, whether he demanded only that he, Philip,should evacuate those cities which, being captured byhimself, were held by the right of war; or those, also,which he had received from his ancestors.'

The Achaeans and JEtolians were preparing toanswer, but, as the sun was near setting, the conferencewas adjourned to the next day; and Philip returnedto his station whence he came, the Romans and alliesto their camp.

state that the army of Quintns Caecilius should be dis­banded, as it could be of no use at present, Hannibalhaving already retired into winter quarters; and, be­sides, so powerful was the distemper in that camp, thatunless they were speedily separated, not one of themprobably would survive.' The senate left it with theconsul to determine those matters, in such manner ashe should judge best for the good of the nation andhis own honor. The city was at that time suddenlyengaged in a consideration respecting religion. Fre­quent showers of stones having fallen, the Sibyllinebooks were on that occasion inspected; in which werefound certain verses, importing that ' whensoever a fo­reign enemy shall have carried war into the land ofItaly, he may be expelled and conquered, if the IdaeanMother be brought from Pessinus to Rome.' Theseverses, discovered by the decemvirs, affected the se­nate the more, because the ambassadors, who had car­ried the offering to Delphi, affirmed also that they hadperformed sacrifice, and consulted the Pythian Apollo;and that the oracle had answered that the Romanswould soon obtain a much greater victory than thatwhich gave them the spoils of which their offering wascomposed. They considered as a confirmation of thesame that Scipio's mind was impelled, as it were, bysome presages of an end to the war, when he had soearnestly insisted on having Africa for his province.In order, therefore, that they might the sooner ac­quire the enjoyment of this triumph, portended tothem by the fates, omens, and oracles, they set aboutconsidering how the goddess might be transported toRome.

old under arms in Sicily, Africa, and Macedonia; theywere now, in short, worn out with labor and fatigue, andhad lost the best part of their blood by the manywounds which they had received.' The consul toldthem, that ' the grounds on which they demanded theirdischarge appeared to him to be reasonable, if the de­mand had been made in a moderate manner; but thatneither on that, nor on any other grounds, could mu­tiny ever be justified. Wherefore, if they were con­tented to adhere to their standards, and obey orders,he would write to the senate concerning their release;and that what they desired would more easily be ob­tained by modest behavior than by turbulence.'
4. At this time, Philip was pushing on the siege ofThaumaci, with the utmost vigor, by means of moundsand engines, and was ready to bring up the ram tothe walls, when he was obliged to relinquish the un­dertaking by the sudden arrival of the jEtolians, who,under the command of Archidamus, having made theirway into the town between the posts of the Macedo­nians, never ceased, day or night, making continualsallies, sometimes against the guards, sometimes againstthe works. They were at the same time favored bythe nature of the place; for Thaumaci stands near theroad from ThermopylEe, and the Malian bay, throughLamia, on a lofty eminence, hanging immediately overthe narrow pass called Caele. After passing throughthe craggy grounds of Thessaly, the roads are ren­dered intricate by the windings of the valleys, and onthe near approach to the city, such an immense plainopens at once to view, like a vast sea, that the eye canscarcely reach the bounds of the expanse beneath.From this surprising prospect it was called Thaumaci.The city itself is secured, not only by the height of itssituation, but by its standing on a rock, from the sidesof which, all round, the projecting parts had beenpared off. In consequence of these difficulties, andthe prize not appearing sufficient to recompense somuch toil and danger, Philip desisted from the at­tempt. The winter also was approaching; he there-

in which the money had been advanced, he had alsobeen the first adviser of the same, on account of theemptiness of the treasury, and the inability of thepeople to pay taxes.' The senate were well pleased atbeing reminded of this matter, and the consuls beingordered to propose the question, decreed, that ' mo­ney should be discharged in three payments: that thepresent consuls should make the first payment imme­diately; and that the other two instalments should bemade by the third and fifth consuls from that time.'All their cares soon after gave place to one alone:when, on the arrival of ambassadors, they were madeacquainted with the grievances of the Locrensians, ofwhich, until that day they had been ignorant; griev­ances which greatly disturbed the people, who were,however, less provoked at the villany of Quintus Ple-minius, than at the partiality or negligence shown inthe business by Scipio. As the consuls were sittingin the comitium, ten ambassadors of the Locrensiansin squalid mourning apparel, holding out branches ofolive (the badges of suppliants), according to theGrecian custom, prostrated themselves on the groundbefore the tribunal with lamentable cries. On in­quiring who they were, they answered, 'that theywere Locrensians, who had experienced such treatmentfrom Quintus Pleminius, the lieutenant-general, andhis soldiers, as the Roman people would not wish eventhe Carthaginians to suffer; and that they requestedthe favor of being admitted to an audience of the se­nate, that they might represent to them their deplor­able situation.'
17. An audience being granted, the eldest of themspoke to this effect: ' Conscript fathers, I know thatit would tend exceedingly to increase the regard whichyou may think proper to afford to our complaints, ifyou were fully informed of the manner in which Locriwas betrayed to Hannibal, and also by what means theCarthaginian garrison was expelled, and the town re­established under your dominion: for if the peoplegenerally taken, were intirely clear of the guilt of the

himself, with his own legions, set out for Capua, beingscarcely able to endure the motion of a litter, hiswounds were so very painful. But he first despatcheda letter to Rome, with an account of Marcellus' death,and of his own dangerous situation. 'It was not in hispower,' he said, 'to go to Rome to attend the elec­tions, because he was sure he should not be able tohear the fatigue of the journey; and besides, that hewas uneasy about Tarentum, lest Hannibal might marchthither from Bruttium. It was therefore necessary thatsome persons should be commissioned to come to himin his quarters, men of prudence, to whom he couldwith freedom speak his thoughts on the present stateof affairs.' The reading of this letter caused greatsorrow for the death of one consul, and apprehensionsfor the safety of the other. The senate therefore sentQuintus Fabius the younger to Venusia, to take thecommand of the army there; and deputed three per­sons to wait on the consul, Sextus Julius Caesar, Lu­cius Licinius Pollio, and Lucius Cincius Alimentus,who had a few days before come home from Sicily.These were ordered to deliver a message to the con­sul, that if he could not come himself to Rome, to holdthe elections, he would, within the Roman territories,nominate a dictator for that purpose; and directionswere given, that in case the consul should have goneto Tarentum, then Quintus Claudius, the pretor, shouldlead the army from its present quarters into that partof the country where he could afford protection to thegreatest number of the cities of the allies. In thecourse of this summer Marcus Valerius passed fromSicily to Africa with a fleet of one hundred sail; and,making a descent near the city of Clupea, ravaged thecountry to a great extent, meeting scarcely any one inarms. After which, the troops employed in these de­predations made a hasty retreat to their ships, in con­sequence of a sudden report that the Carthaginian fleetwas approaching. This fleet consisted of eighty-threeships, with which the Roman commander came to anengagement not far from Clupea, and gained a com-

most drawing up by the hand those who followed, andthe hindmost lifting up those before them, they madetheir way to the summit; and from thence, with loudshouts, poured down into the city, which had beenalready taken by the Romans. Then it plainly ap­peared that resentment and hatred had been the mo­tives of the assault: no one thought of taking pri­soners, no one thought of booty, though the objects laybefore their eyes. The armed and unarmed wereslain without distinction, women and men promiscu­ously; the cruel rage of the soldiers proceeded even toslaying of infants. They then set fire to the houses,and what could not be thus destroyed, they levelled tothe ground; so earnest were they to erase every traceof the city, and to abolish every mark of the enemy'sresidence. Scipio from thence led his army to Cas-tulo, which was defended by a great concourse of Spa­niards, and also by the remains of the Carthaginianarmy, collected from the places whither they had dis­persed in their flight. But the news of the calamitiesof the Illiturgians had preceded the arrival of Scipio,and thrown the garrison into fright and despair; andas they were differently circumstanced, while eachparty wished to provide for their own safety, withoutregard to the rest, at first silent suspicion, afterward'sopen discord, ensued, and caused a separation betweenthe Carthaginians and Spaniards. Cerdubellus openlyadvised the latter to surrender. Himilco commandedthe Carthaginian garrison auxiliaries, who, togetherwith the city, were delivered up to the Romans byCerdubellus, after he had privately made terms forhimself. This victory was not followed with so muchseverity; the guilt of this people not having been sogreat as that of the former, and their voluntary sur­render mitigating, in some degree, the resentmentagainst them.

Over these he laid planks, which formeda passage from ship to ship through the whole line;and under those bridges of communication he leftopenings, through which the scout boats might runout towards the enemy, and retreat with safety. Hav­ing completed these sea works as well as the time al­lowed, he put on board the transports about a thousandchosen men to defend them, with a vast quantity ofweapons, chiefly missive, sufficient to serve for a battleof any continuance. Thus prepared, they waited atten­tively the coming of the enemy. Had the Carthagi­nians been expeditious, they might at the first onsethave overpowered the Romans, every thing being inhurry and confusion; but dispirited by their losses onland, and losing thereby their confidence at sea also,where their strength however was superior, they spentthe whole day in approaching slowly, and about sunsetput into a harbor, which the Africans call Rnscino.On the following day, about sunrise, they formed theirships in a line towards the open sea, as if for a regularsea fight, and as if the Romans were to come out tomeet them.

36. These expressions, delivered with eagerness andvehemence by every one in the assembly, reached theears of Philip, though he stood at a distance. Hetherefore requested of Quintius that the whole businessmight be deferred until the next day; and then he would,positively, either prevail on the allies to accede to hisproposals, or suffer himself to be prevailed on to accedeto theirs. The shore at Thronium was appointed fortheir meeting, and all the parties assembled there early.Philip began with intreating Quintius, and all who werepresent, not to harbor such sentiments as must tend toobstruct a pacification ; and then desired time while hecould send ambassadors to Rome, to the senate, de­claring that ' he would either obtain a peace on theterms mentioned, or would accept whatever terms thesenate should prescribe.' None approved of this: theysaid, he only sought a delay, and leisure to collect hisstrength. But Quintius observed, ' that such an ob­jection would have been well founded, if it were thensummer and a season fit for action: as matters stood,and the winter being just at hand, nothing would belost by allowing him time to send ambassadors: for,without the authority of the senate, no agreement whichthey might conclude with the king would be valid;and besides, they would by this means have an oppor­tunity, while the winter itself would necessarily causea suspension of arms, to learn what terms were likelyto be approved by the senate.' The other chiefs of theallies came over to this opinion; and a cessation ofhostilities for two months being granted, they resolvedthat each of their states should send an ambassadorwith the necessary information to the senate, and inorder that it should not be deceived by the misrepre­sentations of Philip. To the above contention wasadded an article, that all the king's troops should beimmediately withdrawn from Phocis and Locris.

41. These reasons had brought back Damocritus andthe jEtolians to the interest of the Romans. Marchingout, therefore, in conjunction with Amynander, kingof the Athamanians, they laid siege to Cercinium. Theinhabitants here had shut their gates, whether of theirown choice or by compulsion is unknown, as they hada garrison of the king's troops. However, in a fewdays, Cercinium was taken and burned ; and after great, slaughter had been made, those who survived, bothfree men and slaves, were carried off amongst otherspoil. This caused such terror, as made all thosewho dwelt round the lake Boebius abandon their cities,and fly to the mountains: and the jEtolians not find­ing booty, turned away from thence, and proceededinto Perrhaebia. There they took Cyretias by storm,and sacked it without mercy. The inhabitants of Mal-loea, making a voluntary submission, were receivedinto alliance. From Perrhaebia, Amynander advisedto march to Gomphi, because that city lies close toAthamania, and there was reason to think that it mightbe reduced without any great difficulty. But the jEto-lians, for the sake of plunder, directed their march tothe rich plains of Thessaly, Amynander following,though he did not approve either of their carelessmethod of carrying on their depredations, or of theirpitching their camp in any place where chance di­rected, without choice, and without taking any care tofortify it. Therefore, lest their rashness and negli­gence might be the cause of some misfortune to him­self and his troops, when he saw them forming theircamp in low grounds, under the city Phecadus, hetook possession, with his own troops, of an eminenceabout five hundred paces distant, which could be ren­dered secure by a slight fortification.

whose lot Italy fell, should receive two legions fromMarcus Sextius, pretor.
41. Publius Scipio's command in the province ofAfrica was prolonged, with the armies which he thenhad. To Marcus Valerius Falto, pretor, were decreedthe two legions in Bruttium, which Caius Livius hadcommanded the preceding year. Publius jElius, pre­tor, was to receive two legions in Sicily from CneiusTremellius. One legion, which had been under Pub­lius Lentulus, propretor, was decreed to Marcus Fa-bius, for Sardinia. The command in Etruria was con­tinued to Marcus Servilius, consul of the former year,with his own two legions. With regard to Spain, thesenate ordered, that whereas Lucius Cornelius Lentu­lus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus had remained in thatcountry for several years, the consuls should thereforemake application to the tribunes, that, if they thoughtproper, they should ask the people, whom they wouldorder to have charge in Spain; and that the person soordered should collect such a number of Romans outof the two armies as would make up one legion, andas many of the allies of the Latine confederacy aswould form fifteen cohorts; with which he shouldconduct the business of the province; and that Lu­cius Cornelius and Lucius Manlius shall lead homethe veteran soldiers to Italy. To the consul Corneliuswas decreed a squadron of fifty ships out of the twofleets, one of which was under Cneius Octavins inAfrica, the other under Publius Vellius, guarding thecoast of Sicily; with liberty to take such of those ves­sels as he might please. It was also decreed that PubliusScipio should keep the fifty ships of war on his stationas before; and that if Cneius Octavius chose to conti­nue in the command of these as heretofore, he shouldhave it for that year as propretor: that if Laeliusshould be set at the head of the fleet, then Octaviusshould return to Rome, and bring home such ships asthe proconsul had not occasion for.

greatly extend his line, and without delay began theengagement, in order to divert the enemy's attention,by the hurry of the conflict, from Laelius' detachment,who were advancing from among the hills. In thisthey succeeded, for the Spaniards were unconscious oftheir coming, until they heard the tumult of the fightbetween them and their own cavalry on the rear. Thusthere were two different battles; two lines of foot, andtwo bodies of horse, were engaged along the extent ofthe plain, the circumscribed ground not allowing themto be composed of both together. On the side of theSpaniards, as neither the foot could assist the horse,nor the horse the foot, the latter, who had rashly ven­tured into the plain, relying on the support of theircavalry, were cut to pieces; and the cavalry being sur­rounded, could neither withstand the Roman infantryin front (for by this time their own was intirely cutoff), nor the cavalry on their rear; but, having formedin a circle, and defended themselves a long time with­out changing their position, they were all slain to aman. Thus not one of those who were engaged in thevalley, either horse or foot, survived the fight. Thethird company, which had stood on the hill rather toview the engagement securely, than to take any part init, had both room and time to make their escape. Thetwo princes also fled with them during the tumult, andbefore the army was intirely surrounded.

Of the Romans and their allies,there fell one thousand two hundred; above threethousand were wounded. The victory would havebeen less bloody, if the battle had happened in a moreextensive plain, so as to have allowed the enemy aneasy flight. Indibilis, renouncing his project of pro­ceeding farther in the war, and seeing no better pro­spect of safety in this desperate state of his affairs thanin the honor and clemency of Scipio, which he had al­ready experienced, sent his brother Mandonius to him;who, prostrating himself at his feet, lamented 'the

36. The public anxiety respecting Hasdrnbal's marchinto Italy increased daily. At first, envoys from theMassilians brought information that he had passedinto Gaul, and that the inhabitants of that countrywere in high spirits on the occasion; because it wasreported that he had brought a vast quantity of goldfor the purpose of hiring auxiliaries. In companywith these envoys, on their return, were sent fromRome, Sextus Antistius and Marcus Retius, to inquireinto the matter; who brought back an account thatthey had sent persons with Massilian guides, who, bymeans of some Gallic chieftains, connected in friend­ship with the Massilians, might procure exact intel­ligence of every particular; and that they had dis­covered with certainty that Hasdrubal, having alreadycollected a very numerous army, intended to passthe Alps in the following spring, and that nothingprevented his doing it immediately, but the passes ofthose mountains being shut up by the winter. PubliusjElius Pastus was elected and inaugurated into theoffice of augur, in the room of Marcus Marcellus; andCneius Cornelius Dolabella into that of king in reli­gious matters, in the room of Marcus Marcius, whohad died two years before. In this year, the firsttime since Hannibal's coming into Italy, the lustrumwas closed by the censors, Publius Sempronius Tudi-tanus and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus. The numberof citizens rated was one hundred and thirty-seventhousand one hundred and eight, a number muchsmaller than it had been before the war. It is re­corded that in this same year the comitium was co­vered, and the Roman games once repeated by thecurule ediles, Quintus Metellus and Caius Servilius;and the plebeian games twice, by the plebeian ediles,Quintus Mamilius and Marcus Caecilius Metellus.These also erected three statues in the temple of Ceres,and there was a feast of Jupiter on occasion of thegames.

Did you intendto settle your habitations at Sucro? a place in which,if I your general at my departure, after finishing thebusiness of the province, had left you, and there toremain, you ought to have appealed to gods and men,on not being allowed to return to your wives and chil­dren. But supposing that you had banished out ofyour minds all recollection of them, as you did ofyour country and of me, let us examine what could beyour design, and whether it can be accounted for onthe supposition of a depravity of principle, without in­cluding also the utmost degree of folly. While I wasalive, and the other part of the army safe, with whichI took Carthage in one day, with which I vanquished,put to flight, and drove out of Spain, four generals,with four armies of the Carthaginians; could you ex­pect that you, who were but eight thousand men, (allof you of course inferior in worth to Albius and At-rius, since to their command you submitted your­selves,)—could you imagine, I say, that you shouldbe able to wrest the province of Spain out of thehands of the Roman people? I lay no stress on myown name, I put it out of the question, supposing my-self no farther ill treated, than in your easily and joy­fully giving credit to the report of my death.

which were sufficiently powerful over the mind of herlover, but by prayers and appeals to his compassion;with tears having beseeched him not lo forsake herfather and her country, nor suffer Carthage to beburned as the camps had been. Add to this, somenew ground of hope, which offered itself very season­ably, the ambassadors acquainting him that they hadmet, near the city called Abba, four thousand Celtibe-rians, able young men, who had been enlisted by theirrecruiting parties in Spain, and that Hasdrubal wouldspeedily arrive with a body of troops far from con­temptible. Syphax not only gave a favorable answerto the Carthaginians, but showed them a multitude ofNumidian peasants, to whom he had, within a fewdays, given arms and horses; and assured them also,that he would call out all the youth in his kingdom;observing, that 'their loss had been occasioned byfire, not by battle; and that he only who was defeatedby arms ought to be deemed inferior to his enemy.'Such was his reply; and, a few days after, he andHasdrubal again joined their forces, when their wholearmy amounted to about thirty thousand fighting men.

While Scipio gave his whole attention to thesiege of Utica, as if no farther hostilities were to beapprehended from Syphax and the Carthaginians, andwas employed in bringing up his machines to the walls,he was called away by the news of the war being re­vived. Leaving, therefore, only a small number ofmen on sea and land, to keep up the appearance of asiege, he set out himself with the main body of thearmy to meet the enemy. At first he took post on ahill, distant about four miles from the king's camp.On the day following, descending into the great plains,as they are called, which lie under that hill, with abody of cavalry, he spent the day in advancing fre­quently to the enemy's posts, and provoking them byslight skirmishes.

with ropes to such a height, that men might come'inwithout stooping. Scarcely was the passage suffi­ciently opened, when the deserters rushed in eagerlythrough the gate; and, when about six hundred hadentered, the rope by which it was kept suspended be­ing loosened, the portcullis fell down with a greatnoise. Part of the Salapians now attacked the de­serters, who, as if among friends, carried their armscarelessly on their shoulders, as on a march; while therest, from the tower adjoining- the gate and from thewalls, beat off the enemy with stones, and pikes, andjavelins. Thus Hannibal, ensnared by an artifice wor­thy of himself, was obliged to retire, and went thenceto raise the siege of Locri, which Cincius was pushingforward with the utmost vigor, having constructed va­rious works, and being supplied with engines of everykind from Sicily. Mago, who almost despaired pf beingable to hold out and maintain the defence of the city,received the first gleam of returning hope from the newsof Marcellus' death. This was soon followed by an ex­press, acquainting him that Hannibal, having sent for­ward the Numidian cavalry, was hastening after, atthe head of the main body of infantry, with all thespeed he could make. As soon, therefore, as he un­derstood, by signals made from the watch-towers, thatthe Numidians were drawing nigh, he with his ownforces, suddenly throwing open a gate, rushed out fu­riously on the besiegers. The suddenness of hisattack, rather than inequality of strength, at first madethe dispute doubtful; but afterwards, when the Numi­dians came up, the Romans were struck with such dis­may, that they fled in confusion towards the sea andtheir ships, leaving behind their works and machineswhich they used in battering the walls. In this man­ner did the approach of Hannibal raise the siege ofLocri.

he could retreat for safety, he would not have even apretence for staying longer in Italy. He likewise sentan express to Rhegium, to the commander of the bodyof troops, which the consul Laevinus had placed there,to act against the Bruttians, and which consisted ofeight thousand men, all accustomed to live by plunder,the greater part of whom had been brought out ofSicily from Agathyrna, as was mentioned above. Tothese were joined many natives of the country, whodeserted from the Bruttians, equally daring, and underequal necessity to dare every thing. He ordered thisband to be led, first, to ravage the lands of Bruttium,and afterwards to besiege the city of Caulon. Theseorders they executed, not only with diligence but withavidity; and after plundering the country, and dis­persing the inhabitants, attacked the city with theirutmost vigor. Marcellus, incited by his colleague'sletter, and also by an opinion which he had himselfconceived, that he was the only Roman general able tocope with Hannibal, quitted his winter-quarters assoon as forage could be found, and met him at Canu-sium. The Carthaginian was at this time employed inendeavoring to entice the Canusians to a revolt, but onhearing of Marcellus' approach, he decamped and re­tired. The country was open, affording no cover foran ambuscade, for which reason he resolved to drawback into more woody tracts. Marcellus pressed closeon his steps, encamped within view of him, and, assoon as the trenches were finished, drew out his legionsand offered battle. Hannibal sent out single troops ofcavalry, and the light spearmen from his infantry, toskirmish with the enemy, but did not think it advisableto risk the issue of a general engagement. He washowever drawn into a contest of that sort which hewished to avoid: for although, by marching away inthe night, he gained some ground of the enemy, yetMarcellus overtook him in an open country, and, ashe was forming his camp, put a stop to his works, byattacking the workmen on all sides.

50. On the night which followed the battle Neroset out on his return; and by marches even speedierthan he had made in coming, on the sixth day afterreached his former post opposite the enemy. Thecrowds of people attending him were less than before,because no messenger had preceded him; but theseexhibited such demonstrations of joy, as to seem trans­ported almost beyond their reason. It is impossibleto express or describe the emotions that agitated theminds of all persons at Rome, either while waiting indoubtful expectation of the event, or when they re­ceived the news of the victory. The senators neverquitted the senate-house, nor the magistrates, nor thepeople, the forum, from the rising to the setting sun,during the whole of Claudius' march; so eager werethey to greet him. The matrons, incapable themselvesof contributing aid, had recourse to prayers and sup­plications; and going about from one temple to ano­ther, wearied the gods with their intreaties and theirvows. While the public were in this painful sus­pense, first an unauthenticated rumor spread that twoNarnian horsemen had come from the field of battle tothe camp which stood on the frontiers of Umbria,with intelligence that the enemy were utterly defeated.For some time this news, though listened to, was butlittle credited, as being too great, and too joyful, forthe people's minds to admit, or readily believe; andeven the quickness of the conveyance was urged as anobjection to the truth of it; as the account said thatthe battle was fought only two days before.

46. Orders were previously given by the consul Li-vius, that, on their arrival, each tribune should beaccommodated with a lodging by a tribune, each cen­turion by a centurion, each horseman by a horseman,and each footman by a footman. He considered thatit would not be prudent to enlarge the camp, lest theenemy might discover the coming of the second cou-sul; while the crowding together of additional num­bers, into lodgings in a narrow space, would be at­tended with the less inconvenience, as the troops ofClaudius had brought with them hardly any thing ex­cept their arms. Claudius had augmented his armywith a number of volunteers; for many, both veteransoldiers discharged from service, and young men, of­fered themselves on his march; and, as they eagerlypressed to be employed, he enlisted such of them as,from their personal appearance, seemed fit for theservice. The camp of Livius was near Sena, andHasdrubal lay about five hundred paces beyond it.Wherefore Nero, to avoid entering it before night,halted when he came nigh, and where he was con­cealed behind mountains. As darkness came on, hismen, marching silently, were conducted into tents,each by a person of his own rank; where they werehospitably entertained, amid mutual congratulationsand unbounded joy. Next day a council was held, atwhich was also present the pretor Lucius Porcius Li-cinus. At this time his camp was joined to that of theconsuls. It should however be noticed, that beforetheir coming he had often baffled and perplexed theenemy, leading his troops along the high ground;sometimes seizing narrow defiles to arrest his march,sometimes harassing him by attacks on his rear orflanks, and putting in practice, indeed, every art ofwar. He now assisted at the council.
