402 THE COMMONWEALTH AND ITS ECONOMY. [Book IV.


reserve-fund; but even the figures appearing for theseobjects, when compared with the wide domain of the Romanrule, attest the small amount of the net proceeds of theRoman taxes. In a certain sense therefore the old principleequally honourable and judicious—that the political hege­mony should not be treated as a privilege yielding profit—still governed Rome's financial administration of the pro­vinces as it had governed that of Italy. What the Romancommunity levied from its transmarine subjects was, as arule, re-expended for the military security of the transmarinepossessions; and if these Roman imposts fell more heavilyon those who paid them than the earlier taxation, in so faras they were in great part expended abroad, the substitu­tion, on the other hand, of a single ruler and a centra­lized military administration for the many petty rulers andarmies involved a very considerable financial saving. It istrue, however, that this principle of a better and earlier agecame from the very first to be infringed and mutilated by thenumerous exceptions which were allowed to prevail. Theground-tenth levied by Hiero and Carthage in Sicily wentfar beyond the amount of an annual war-contribution. Withjustice moreover Scipio iEmilianus says in Cicero, that itwas unbecoming for the Roman burgess-body to be at thesame time the ruler and the tax-gatherer of the nations.The appropriation of the customs-dues was not compatiblewith the principle of disinterested hegemony, and the highrates of the customs as well as the vexatious mode of levy­ing them were not fitted to allay the sense of the injusticethereby inflicted. Even as early probably as this period thename of publican became synonymous among the Easternpeoples with that of rogue and robber: no burden contri­buted so much as this to make the Roman name offensiveand odious especially in the East. But when Gaius Gracchusand those who called themselves the "popular party" inRome came to the helm, political sovereignty was declaredin plain terms to be a right which entitled every one whoshared in it to a number of bushels of corn, the hegemonywas converted into a direct ownership of the soil, and themost complete system of making the most of that owuershipwas not only iutroduced but with shameless candour legallyjustified and proclaimed. It was certainly not a mere acci­dent, that the hardest lot in this respect fell precisely tothe two least warlike provinces, Sicily and Asia.

give up the assault, and to march onward to Italy past thecamp. For six successive days they continued to defile—aproof of the cumbrousness of their baggage still more thanof the immensity of their numbers. The general permittedthe march to proceed without attacking them. We caneasily understand why he did not allow himself to be ledastray by the insulting inquiries of the enemy whether theRomans had no commissions for their wives at home; butthe fact, that he did not take advantage of this rash defilingof the barbarian columns in front of the concentrated Romantroops for the purpose of attack, shows how little he trustedhis unpractised soldiers.
When the march was over, he broke up his encampment Battle ofand followed in the steps of the enemy, preserving rigorous Muie Sex"order and carefully entrenching himself night after night. ilX"The Teutones, who were striving to gain the coast road,marching down the banks of the Rhone reached the districtof Aquae Sextiae, followed by the Romans. The light Ligu-rian troops of the Romans, as they were drawing water,here came into collision with the Celtic rear-guard, theAmbrones; the conflict soon became general; after a hotstruggle the Romans conquered and pursued the retreatingenemy up to their waggon-stronghold. This first successfulcollision elevated the spirits of the general as well as of thesoldiers; on the third day after it Marius drew up his arrayfor a decisive battle on the hill, the summit of which borethe Roman camp. The Teutones, long impatient to measurethemselves against their antagonists, immediately rushed upthe hill and began the conflict. It was severe and protracted:up to midday the Germans stood like a wall; but the un­wonted heat of the Provencal sun relaxed their energies,and a false alarm in their rear, where a band of Roman camp-boys ran forth from a wooded ambuscade with loud shouts,fully decided the breaking up of the wavering ranks. Thewhole horde was scattered, and, as was to be expected in aforeign land, either put to death or taken prisoners. Amongthe captives was King Teutobod; among the killed a multi­tude of women, who, not unacquainted with the treatmentwhich awaited them as slaves, had caused themselves to beslain in desperate resistance at their waggons, or had putthemselves to death in captivity, after having vainly re­quested to be dedicated to the service of the gods and of thesacred virgins of Vesta (summer of 652). 102.

menfc of aristocratic nobodies. Even the inaction of thegovernment in its outward relations was doubtless connectedwith this policy of the nobility, exclusive towards commoners,and distrustful towards the individual members of their ownorder. By no surer means could they keep commoners,whose deeds were their patent of nobility, aloof from thepure circles of the aristocracy than by giving no opportunityto any one to perform deeds at all; to the existing govern­ment of general mediocrity even an aristocratic conquerorof Syria or Egypt would have proved extremely inconve­nient.
It is true that now also there was no want of opposition, Attempts atand it was even to a certain extent effectual. The adminis- reform,tration of justice was improved. The administrative juris- Permanentdiction, which the senate exercised either personally or """"I"1by extraordinary commissions, as occasion required, over ^ons-the provincial magistrates, was confessedly inadequate. Itwas an innovation with a momentous bearing on the wholepublic life of the Roman community, when in 605, on the 149.proposal of Lucius Calpurnius Piso, a standing senatorialcommission (qucestio ordinaries was instituted to try injudicial form the complaints oi the provincials regarding theextortion of their Roman magistrates. An effort was made Vote byto emancipate the comitia from the preponderating influence ballot,of the aristocracy. The panacea of Roman democracy wasvote by ballot in the assemblies of the burgesses, whichwas introduced first for the elections of magistrates by theGabinian law (615), then for the public tribunals by the 139.Cassian law (617), lastly for the voting on legislative pro- 137.posals by the Papirian law (623).

punishment for defeats which he sustained through arrantfolly and insubordination (P. 345), but was even allowed atriumph; Gnaeus Pompeius, who had behaved still worse, wasstill more extravagantly honoured by Sulla (P. 344, 378).The extensive range and the worst enormities of the pro­scriptions and confiscations probably arose not so muchfrom Sulla's own wish as from this spirit of indifference,which in his position indeed was hardly more pardonable.That Sulla with his intrinsically energetic and yet withalindifferent temperament should conduct himself very va­riously, sometimes with incredible indulgence, sometimeswith inexorable severity, may readily be conceived. Thesaying repeated a thousand times, that he was before hisregency a good-natured mild man but when regent a blood­thirsty tyrant, carries in it its own refutation; if he as re­gent displayed the reverse of his earlier gentleness, it mustrather be said that he punished with the same careless non­chalance with which he pardoned. This half-ironical fri­volity pervades his whole political action. It is always asif the victor, just as it pleased him to call his merit in gain­ing victory good fortune, esteemed the victory itself of novalue; as if he had a partial presentiment of the vanity andperishableness of his own work; as if after the manner of a, steward he preferred making repairs to pulling down and revbuilding, and allowed himself in the end to be content witha sorry patchwork to conceal the flaws.
But, such as he was, this Don Juan of politics was a man suiia afterof one mould. His whole life attests the internal equili- his retire-brium of his nature; in the most diverse situations Sulla ment-remained unchangeably the same. It was the same temper,which after the brilliant successes in Africa made him seekonce more the idleness of the capital, and after the fullpossession of absolute power made him find rest and refresh­ment in his Cuman villa. In his mouth the saying, thatpublic affairs were a burden which he threw off so soon ashe might and could, was no mere phrase. After his resigna­tion he remained entirely like himself, without peevishnessand without affectation, glad to be rid of public affairs andyet interfering now and then when opportunity offered. .Hunting and fishing and the composition of his memoirsoccupied his leisure hours; by way of interlude he arranged,at the request of the discordant citizens, the internal affairsof the neighbouring colony of Puteoli as confidently and

throw the oligarchy hy means of this double official power, careseemed now taken to prevent some possibly wiser successorfrom making a better use of the same lever. According tothe previous arrangement the magistrate immediately nomi­nated by the people might have had a military position;the Sullan arrangement, on the other hand, reserved such aposition exclusively for those magistrates whom the senateconfirmed in their authority by prolonging their term ofoffice. No doubt this prolongation of office had now be­come a standing usage; but it still—so far as respects theauspices and the name, and constitutional formality in gene­ral—continued to be treated as an extraordinary extensionof their term. This was no matter of indifference. Noone, or at the utmost the burgesses alone, could depose theconsul or praetor from his office; the proconsul and pro­praetor were nominated and dismissed by the senate, so thatby this enactment the whole military power, on which every­thing ultimately depended, became formally at any ratedependent on the senate.Shelving of Lastly we have already observed that the highest of allthe censor- magistracies, the censorship, though not finally abolished,,lnp- was shelved in the same way as formerly the dictatorship.
Practically it might certainly be dispensed with. Provisionwas otherwise made for filling up the senate. From thetime that Italy was practically tax-free and the army wassubstantially formed by enlistment, the register of thoseliable to taxation and service lost its chief significance; and,if disorder prevailed in the equestrian roll or the list of thoseentitled to the suffrage, that disorder was probably notaltogether unwelcome. There thus remained only thecurrent financial functions, which the consuls had hithertodischarged when, as frequently happened, no election ofcensors had taken place, and which they now took as a partof their ordinary official duties. Compared with the sub­stantial gain, that by the abeyance of the censorship themagistracy lost its crowning dignity, it was a matter oflittle moment and was not at all prejudicial to the soledominion of the supreme governing corporatiou, that—witha view to satisfy the ambition of the senators now so muchmore numerous—the number of the Pontifices was increasedfrom eight (i. 307), that of the Augurs from nine (i. 307),that of the Custodiers of Oracles from ten (i. 304), to fifteeneach, and that of the Epulones from three (ii. 399) to seven.

breadth, the first rank of which in dangerous combats notunfrequently tied together their metallic girdles with cords.Their manners were rude. Flesh was frequently devouredraw. The bravest and, if possible, the tallest man was kingof the host. Not unfrequently, after the manner of theCelts and of barbarians generally, the time and place of thecombat were previously arranged with the enemy, and some­times also, before the battle began, an individual opponentwas challenged to single combat. The conflict was ushered inby their insulting the enemy with unseemly gestures, and bya horrible noise—the men raising their battle-shout, and thewomen and children increasing the din by drumming on theleathern covers of the waggons. The Cimbrian foughtbravely—death on the bed of honour was deemed by himthe only death worthy of a free man—but after the victory heindemnified himself by the most savage brutality, and some­times promised beforehand to present to the gods of battlewhatever victory should place in the power of the victor.The effects of the enemy were broken in pieces, the horseswere killed, the prisoners were hanged or preserved only tobe sacrificed to the gods. It was the priestesses—grey-headedwomen in white linen dresses and unshod—who, like Iplii-genia in Scythia, offered these sacrifices, and prophesied thefuture from the streaming blood of the victim whether cap­tive of war or criminal. How much in these customs was theuniversal usage of the northern barbarians, how much wasborrowed from the Celts, and how much was peculiar to theGermans, cannot be ascertained ; only, the practice of havingthe army accompanied and directed not by priests, but bypriestesses, may be pronounced as an undoubtedly Germaniccustom. Thus marched the Cimbri iuto the unknown land—an immense multitude of various origin which had congre­gated round a nucleus of Germanic emigrants from the Bal­tic—not without resemblance to the great bodies of emigrants,that in our own times cross the ocean similarly burdened andsimilarly mingled, and with aims not much less vague; car­rying their lumbering waggon-castle, with the dexteritywhich a long migratory life imparts, over streams and moun­tains; dangerous to more civilized nations like the waveand the hurricane, and like these capricious and unaccount­able, now rapidly advancing, now suddenly pausing, turningaside, or receding.

CHAPTER V.
THE PEOPLES OF THE NORTH.
Relations of Fbom the close of the sixth century the Roman communityRome to ruled over the three great peninsulas projecting from thethe north. northern continent into the Mediterranean, at least takenas a whole. Even there however—in the north and west ofSpain, in the valleys of the Ligurian Apennines and the Alps,and in the mountains of Macedonia and Thrace—tribeswholly or partially free continued to defy the negligentRoman government. Moreover the continental communi­cation between Spain and Italy as well as between Italyand Macedonia was very superficially provided for, and thecountries beyond the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Balkanchain—the great river-basins of the Rhone, the Rhine, and theDanube—in the main lay beyond the political horizon of theRomans. We have now to set forth what steps were takenon the part of Rome to secure and to round off her empirein this direction, and how at the same time the great massesof peoples, who were ever moving to and fro behind thatmighty mountain-screen, began to beat at the gates of thenorthern mountains and rudely to remind the Graeco-Romanworld that it was mistaken in believing itself the sole pos­sessor of the earth.The country Let us first glance at the region between the westernbetween the Alps and the Pyrenees.

and with fearful rapidity and violence to maturity. From avery early period the Roman economy was based on the twofactors—always in quest of each other, and always at variance—the husbandry of the small farmer and the money of thecapitalist. The latter in the closest alliance with landhold-ing on a great scale had already for centuries waged againstthe farmer-class a war, which seemed as though it could notbut terminate in the destruction first of the farmers andthereafter of the whole commonwealth, but was broken offwithout being properly decided in consequence of the suc­cessful wars and the comprehensive and ample distribution ofdomains for which they gave facilities. It has already beenshown (ii. 371-377) that in the same age, which renewedthe distinction between patricians and plebeians underaltered names, the disproportionate accumulation of capitalwas preparing a second assault on the farming system. Itis true that the method was different. Formerly the smallfarmer had been ruined by advances of money, which practi­cally reduced him to be the mere steward of his creditor;now he was crushed by the competition of transmarine, andespecially of slave-grown, corn. The capitalists kept pacewith the times; capital, while waging war against labour orin other words against the liberty of the person, of course asit had always done, under the strictest form of law, waged itno longer in that unseemly fashion which converted the freeman on account of debt into a slave, but, on the contrary,with slaves regularly bought and paid; the former usurerof the capital appeared in a shape conformable to the timesas the owner of industrial plantations. But the ultimateresult was in both cases the same—the depreciation of theItalian farms; the supplanting of the petty husbandry, firstin a part of the provinces and then in [taly, by the farmingof large estates; the prevailing tendency to devote the latterin Italy to the rearing of cattle and the culture of the oliveand vine; finally, the replacing of the free labourers in theprovinces as in Italy by slaves. Just as the nobility wasmore dangerous than the patriciate, because the formercould not like the latter be set aside by a change of theconstitution; so this new power of capital was more dan­gerous than that of the fourth and fifth centuries, becausenothing could be done to oppose it by changes in the law ofthe land.

banquet. Another novelty -was a dancing-school, such asScipio iEmilianus full of indignation describes in one of hisspeeches, in which upwards of five hundred boys and girls—the dregs of the people and the children of magistrates and ofdignitaries mixed up together—received instruction from aballet-master in far from decorous castanet-dances, in corre­sponding songs, and in the use of the proscribed Greekstringed instruments. It was a novelty too—not so muchthat a consular and pontifex maximus like Publius Scaevola(consul in 621) should catch the balls in the circus as nimbly 133.as he solved the most complicated questions of law at home—as that noble young Romans should display their jockey-artsbefore all the people at the festal games of Sulla. Thegovernment occasionally attempted to check such practices;as for instance in 639, when all musical instruments, with 115.the exception of the simple flute indigenous in Latium, wereprohibited by the censors. But Rome was no Sparta: thelax government by such prohibitions rather drew attentionto the evils than attempted to remedy them by a sharp andconsistent application of the laws.
If, in conclusion, we glance back at the picture as a wholewhich the literature and art of Italy unfold to our view fromthe death of Ennius to the beginning of the Ciceronian age, wefind in these respects as compared with the preceding epocha most decided decline of productiveness. The higher kindsof literature—such as epos, tragedy, history—have died outor been arrested in their development. The subordinatekinds—the translation and imitation of the intrigue-piece,the farce, the poetical and prose brochure—alone prosper;in this last field of literature swept by the full hurricane ofrevolution we meet with the two men of greatest literarytalent in this epoch, Gaius Gracchus and Gaius Lucilius,who stand out amidst a number of more or less mediocrewriters just as in a similar epoch of French literatureCourier and Beranger stand out amidst a multitude of pre­tentious nullities. In the plastic and delineative arts like­wise the production, always weak, is now utterly null. Onthe other hand the receptive enjoyment of art and literatureflourished: as the Epigoni of this period in the politicalfield gathered in and used up the inheritance that fell totheir fathers, we find them in this field also as diligent fre­quenters of plays, as patrons of literature, as. connoisseursand still more as collectors in art.

no fidelity to the state at all, and proved faithful to theofficer only when he had the skill personally to gain theirattachment. The civil war had given fearful evidence ofthis total revolution in the spirit of the army: six generals,Albinus (P. 257), Cato (P. 258), Rufus (P. 271), Flaccus(P. 307), Cinna (P. 328), and Gaius Carho (P. 342), hadfallen during its course by the hands of their soldiers; Sullaalone had hitherto been able to retain the mastery of thedangerous crew, and that only, in fact, by giving the rein toall their wild desires as no Roman general before him hadever done. If the blame of destroying the old military dis­cipline is on this account attached to him, the censure is notexactly without ground, but yet without justice; he was in­deed the first Roman magistrate who was enabled to dischargehis military and political task only by coming forward as acondottiere. He had not however taken the military dicta­torship for the purpose of making the state subject to thesoldiery, but rather for the purpose of compelling everythingin the state, and especially the army and the officers, to sub­mit once more to the authority of civil order. When this be­came evident, an opposition arose against him among hisown staff. The oligarchy might play the tyrant as respectedother citizens; but that the generals also, who with theirgood swords had replaced the overthrown senators in theirseats, should now be summoned to yield implicit obedienceto this very senate, seemed intolerable. The very two officersin whom Sulla had placed most confidence, resisted the neworder of things. When Gnaeus Pompeius, whom Sulla hadintrusted with the conquest of Sicily and Africa and hadselected for his son-in-law, after accomplishing his task re­ceived orders from the senate to dismiss his army, he omittedto comply and fell little short of open insurrection. Quint usOfella, to whose firm perseverance in front of Praeneste thesuccess of the last and sorest campaign was essentially due,in equally open violation of the newly issued ordinancesbecame a candidate for the consulship without having heldthe inferior magistracies. With Pompeius there was effected,if not a cordial reconciliation, at any rate a compromise.Sulla, who knew his man sufficiently not to fear him, did notresent the impertinent remark which Pompeius uttered to hisface, that more people concerned themselves with the risingthan with the setting sun; and accorded to the vain youththe empty honours to which his heart clung (P. 344).

agreement, which had seemed so near, was not effected; itwas Scipio who denounced the armistice. But Sulla main­tained that it was too late and that the agreement had beenalready concluded; whereupon Scipio's soldiers, under thepretext that their general had wrongfully denounced thearmistice, passed over en masse to the ranks of the enemy.The scene closed with an universal embracing, at which thecommanding officers of the revolutionary army had to look on.Sulla gave orders that the consul should be summoned toresign his office, which he did, and should along with hisstaff be escorted by his cavalry to whatever point they de­sired; but Scipio was hardly set at liberty when he resumedthe insignia of his dignity and began afresh to collect troops,without however executing anything further of moment.Sulla and Metellus took up winter quarters in Campaniaand, after the failure of a second attempt to come to termswith Norbanus, maintained the blockade of Capua duringthe winter.Prepara- The results of the first campaign in favour of Sulla were
tions on ttie submission of Apulia, Picenum, and Campania, the dis­solution of the one, and the vanquishing and blockading of theother, consular army. The Italian communities, compelledseverally to choose between their two oppressors, alreadyentered in many instances into negotiations with him, andcaused the political rights which had been won from theopposition-party to be guaranteed to them by formal sepa­rate treaties on the part of the general of the oligarchy. Sullacherished the distinct expectation, and intentionally madeboast of it, that he would overthrow the revolutionary govern­ment in the next campaign and again march into Rome.
But despair seemed to furnish the revolution with freshenergies. The consulship was committed to two of its mostdecided leaders, to Carbo for the third time and to GaiusMarius the younger; the circumstance that the latter, whowas just twenty years of age, could not legally be investedwith the consulship, was as little heeded as any other pointof the constitution. Quintus Sertorius, who in this andother matters proved an inconvenient critic, was ordered toproceed to Etruria with a view to procure new levies, andthence to his province Hither Spain. To replenish thetreasury, the senate was obliged to decree the melting downof the gold and silver vessels of the temples in the capital:that the produce was considerable, is clear from the fact

sioners of a definite sum annually from the public chest forthe purchase of Italian lands for distribution. The new•features in the Sempronian agrarian law, as compared withthe Licinio-Sextian, were, first, the clause in favour of thehereditary possessors; secondly, the leasehold and inalien­able tenure proposed for the new allotments; thirdly andespecially, the permanent executive, the absence of whichunder the older law had been the chief reason why it hadremained virtually without practical application.
War was thus declared against the great landholders,who now, as three centuries ago, found substantially theirorgan in the senate; and once more, after a long interval, asingle magistrate stood forth in earnest opposition to thearistocratic government. It took up the conflict in themode sanctioned by use and wont for such cases, viz. para­lyzing the extravagant action of magistrates by means oftheir colleagues (i. 322). A colleague of Gracchus, MarcusOctavius, a resolute man who was seriously persuaded of theobjectionable character of the proposed domain law, inter­posed his veto when it was about to be put to the vote; astep, the constitutional effect of which was to set aside theproposal. Gracchus then in his turn suspended the busi­ness of the state and the administration of justice, andplaced his seal on the public chest. The government ac­quiesced—it was inconvenient, but the year would draw to anend. Gracchus in perplexity brought his law to the vote asecond time. Octavius of course repeated his veto; and tothe urgent entreaty of his colleague and former friend, thathe would not obstruct the salvation of Italy, he might replythat on that very question, as to how Italy could be saved,opinions differed, but that his constitutional right to use hisveto against the proposal of his colleague was beyond doubt.The senate now made an attempt to open up to Gracchus.a tolerable means of retreat; two cqnsulars challenged himto discuss the matter further in the senate house, and thetribune entered into the scheme with zeal. He sought toconstrue this proposal as implying that the senate had con­ceded the principle of distributing the domainland; butneither was this implied in it, nor was the senate at all dis­posed to yield in the matter; the discussions ended withoutany result. Constitutional means were exhausted. Inearlier times under such circumstances men were not indis­posed to let the proposal made go to sleep for the moment,

intrusting the office of jurymen to men of equestrian censusprocured for the capitalist class an indirect share in ad­ministration and in government, which proved not seldomstronger than the executive; Sulla abolished the eques­trian and restored the senatorial courts. Gaius Gracchusor at any rate the Gracchan period had conceded to theequites a special place at the popular festivals, such as thesenators had for long possessed (ii. 321); Sulla abolished itand relegated the equites to the plebeian benches.* Theequestrian order, created as such by Gaius Gracchus, was de­prived of its political existence by Sulla. The senate was toexercise the supreme power in legislation, administration, andjurisdiction unconditionally, indivisibly, and permanently,and was to be distinguished also by outward tokens notmerely as a privileged, but as the only privileged, order.
For this purpose the governing board had, first of all, to Reorganiza-have its ranks filled up and to be itself placed on a footing tIon of tl,eof independence. The numbers of the senators had been sena e'fearfully reduced by the recent crises. Sulla no doubt nowgave to those who were exiled by the equestrian courtsliberty to return, for instance to the consular Publius Kuti-lius Rufus (P. 219), who however made no use of the per­mission, and to Gaius Cotta the friend of Drusus (P. 237);but this made only slight amends for the gaps which the revo­lutionary and reactionary reigns of terror had created in theranks of the senate. Accordingly by Sulla's directions the its comple-senate had its complement extraordinarily made up by the ment filledaddition of about 300 new senators, whom the assembly of UP ov.ex"the tribes had to nominate from among those of equestrian traol.dml,r.vcensus, and whom they selected, as was natural, chiefly fromthe younger men of the senatorial houses on the one hand,and from Sullan officers and others brought into prominenceby the last revolution on the other.

west to a point beyond Scodra, where Illyria began. Theprotectorate which Rome claimed over Greece Proper like­wise devolved, of course, on the new governor of Macedonia.Tims Macedonia recovered its unity and nearly the samelimits which it had in its most flourishing times. It was nolonger, however, an united kingdom, but an united pro­vince, retaining its communal and even as it would seemits national organization, but placed under an Italian go­vernor aud quaestor, whose names make their appearance onthe native coins along with the name of the country. Astribute there was retained the old moderate land tax, asPaullus had arranged it (ii. 303)—a sum of 100 talents(£24,400) which was allocated in fixed proportions on theseveral communities. Yet the land could not forget its oldglorious dynasty. A few years after the subjugation of thePseudo-Philip another pretended son of Perseus, Alexander,raised the banner of insurrection on the Nestus (Karasu),and had in a short time collected 16,000 men; but thequaestor Lucius Tremellius mastered the insurrectionwithout difficulty and pursued the fugitive pretender as faras Dardania (612). This was the last movement of the 142.proud national spirit of Macedon, which two hundred yearsbefore had accomplished so great things in Hellas and Asia.Henceforward there is scarcely anything else to be told ofthe Macedonians, save that they continued to reckon theiringlorious years from the date at which the countryreceived its definitive provincial organization (608). 146.
Thenceforth the defence of the northern and easternfrontiers of Macedonia or, in other words, of the frontier ofHellenic civilization against the barbarians devolved on theRomans. It was not conducted by them with adequateforces or, on the whole, with befitting energy; but with aprimary view to this military object the great Egnatianhighway was constructed, wliich as early as the time ofPolybius ran from Apollonia and Dyrrhaehium, the two chiefports on the west coast, across the interior to Thessalonica,and was afterwards prolonged to the Hebrus (Maritza).*The new province became the natural basis, on the one hand

In addition to thosewho were placed on the list for their services in or on behalfof the revolutionary army with little discrimination, some­times on account of money advanced to one of its officersor on account of relations of hospitality formed with suchan one, the retaliation fell specially on the "hoarders "—those capitalists who had sat in judgment on the senatorsand had speculated in Marian confiscations; about 1600 ofthe equites, as they were called,* were inscribed on the pro­scription-list. In like manner the professional accusers, theworst scourge of the nobility, who made it their trade tobring men of the senatorial order before the eqviestriancourts, had now to suffer for it—" how comes it to pass,"an advocate soon after asked, "that they have left tous the tribunals, when they were putting to death theaccusers and judges?" The most savage and disgracefulpassions raged without restraint for many months in Italy.In the capital a Celtic band was primarily charged with theexecutions, and Sullan soldiers and subaltern officers tra­versed for the same purpose the different districts of Italy;but every volunteer was also welcome, and the rabble highand low pressed forward not only to earn the rewards ofmurder, but also to gratify their own vindictive or covetousdispositions under the mantle of political persecution. Itsometimes happened that the assassination did not follow,but preceded, the placing of the name on the list of the pro­scribed. One example shows the way in which these exe­cutions took place. At Larinum, a town of new burgessesand favourable to Marian views, one Statius Albius Oppi-anicus, who had fled to Sulla's head-quarters to avoid a chargeof murder, made his appearance after the victory as com­missioner of the regent, deposed the magistrates of thetown, installed himself and his friends in their room, and

qualified poorer burgesses pressed forward unbidden to enterthe army; in fact, from the mass of the civic rabble withoutwork or averse to it, and from the considerable advantageswhich the Roman war-service yielded, the enlistment ofvolunteers could not be difficult. It was therefore simply anecessary consequence of the political and social changes inthe state, that its military arrangements should exhibit atransition from the system of the burgess-levy to the systemof contingents and enlisting; that the cavalry and lighttroops should be mainly formed out of the contingents of thesubjectsjin the Cimbrian campaign, for instance, contin­gents were summoned from as far as Bithynia; and that in thecase of the infantry of the line, while the former arrange­ment of obligation to service was not abolished, every free-born citizen should at the same time be permitted voluntarilyto enter the army, as was first done by Marius in 647. 107.
To this was added the reducing the infantry of the line toa level, which is likewise referable to Marius. The Romanmethod of aristocratic classification had hitherto prevailedalso within the legion. Each of the four divisions of the velites,the hastati, the principes, and the triarii, or, as we may say, ofthe advanced guard, of the first, second, and third line, hadhitherto possessed its special qualification as respected pro­perty or age for service and in great part also its own styleof equipment; each had its definite place once for all as­signed in the order of battle; each had its definite militaryrank and its own standard. All these distinctions were nowsuperseded. Any one admitted as a legionary at all neededno further qualification in order to serve in any division;the discretion of the officers alone decided as to his place.All distinctions of armour were set aside, and consequentlyall recruits were uniformly trained. Connected, doubtless,with this change were the various improvements which Ma­rius introduced in the armament, the carrying of the bag­gage, and similar matters, and which furnish an honour­able evidence of his insight into the practical details of thebusiness of war and of his care for his soldiers; and moreespecially the new method of drill devised by Publius Ruti-lius Rufus (consul 649) the comrade of Marius in the ]osAfrican war. It is a significant fact, that that method con­siderably increased the military culture of the individualsoldier and was essentially based upon the training of thefuture gladiators which was usual in the fighting-schools of

The gates were closed; for five daysand five nights the slaughter continued without interruption;even afterwards the execution of individuals who had escapedor been overlooked was of daily occurrence, and for mouthsthe bloody persecution went on throughout Italy. Theconsul Gnaeus Octavius was the first victim. True to hisoften expressed principle, that he would rather suffer deaththan make the smallest concession to men beyond the paleof law, he refused eveb. now to take flight, and in his con­sular robes awaited at the Janiculum the assassin, who wasnot slow to appear. Among the slain were Lucius Caesar90.

The case is much the same with the advancement of the frontier; we knowthat formerly the JEsis, and in Caesar's time the Kubico, separated the Celticland from Italy, but we do not know when the boundary was shifted. Fromthe circumstance indeed, that Marcus Terentius Vairo Lucullus as propraetorundertook a regulation of the frontier in the district between the iEsis and Kubico(Orelli, Inscr. 570), it has been inferred that that must still have been provincial75. land at least in the year after Lucullus' praetorship 679, since the propraetor
had nothing to do on Italian soil. But it was only within the pomerium thatevery prolonged imperium ceased of itself; in Italy, on the other hand, sucha prolonged imperium was even under Sulla's arrangement allowable, thoughnot in ordinary circumstances occurring. Lucullus, therefore, might still haveacted as propraetor in extraordinary circumstances there; but no such hypothesisis required. This very Lucullus was aheady before the Sullan reorganization32. in 672 engaged as commanding officer in this distinct (P. 337) and was probably,just like Pompeius, furnished by Sulla with proprtetorian powers; in this82. 81. character he must have regulated the boundary in question in 672 or 673(comp. Appian. i. 95), so that no inference may be drawn theuce as to thelegal position of the district. On the other hand a remarkable hint is con­tained in the statement, that Sulla advanced the Roman pomerium (Seneca, deBrev. Vitae, 14; Dio, xliii. 50); which distinction was by Koman state-lawonly accorded to one who had advanced the bounds not of the empire, bat ofthe city—that is, the bounds of Italy (i. 107).

brought about; even Scaurus was evidently open to bribery,only at a price higher than the ordinary senatorial average.The legal validity of the peace was seriously assailed in thesenate; Gaius Memmius declared that the king, if he hadreally submitted unconditionally, could not refuse to appearin Rome, and that he should accordingly be summoned beforethem, with the view of ascertaining the real facts as to thethoroughly irregular negotiations for peace by hearing thetwo contracting parties. They yielded to the inconvenientdemand: but at the same time granted a safe-conduct tothe king inconsistently with the law, for he came not as anenemy, but as one who had made his submission. There­upon the king actually appeared at Rome and presentedhimself to be heard before the assembled people, which waswith difficulty induced to respect the safe-conduct and torefrain from tearing in pieces on the spot the murderer of theItalians at Cirta. But scarcely had Gaius Memmius addressedhis first question to the king, when one of his colleagues in­terfered in virtue of his veto and enjoined the king to besilent. Here too African gold was more powerful than thewill of the sovereign people and of its supreme magistrates.Meanwhile the discussions respecting the validity of thepeace so concluded went on in the senate, and the new con­sul Spurius Postumius Albinus zealously supported theproposal to cancel it, in the expectation that in that casethe chief command in Africa would devolve on him. Thisinduced Massiva, a grandson of Massinissa living in Rome,to assert before the senate his claims to the vacant Numidiankingdom; upon which Bomilcar, one of the confidants ofking Jugurtha, doubtless under his instructions made awaywith the rival of his master by assassination, and, when hewas prosecuted on account of it, escaped with Jugurtha'said from Rome.
This new outrage perpetrated under the eyes of theRoman government was at least so far effectual, that thesenate now cancelled the peace and dismissed the king fromthe city (winter of 643-644). The war was accordingly re­sumed, and the consul Spurius Albinus was invested withthe command (644). But the African army was down toits lowest grades in a state of disorganization correspondingto such a political and military superintendence.

The testa-war for the inent came into force: but the two sons of Micipsa—thevehement Hiempsal still more than his weak elder brother—soon came into so violent collision with their cousin whomthey looked on as an intruder into the legitimate line ofsuccession, that the idea of a joint reign of the three kingshad to be abandoned. An attempt was made to carry outa division of the heritage; but the quarrelling kings couldnot agree as to their quotas of land and treasure, and theprotecting power, to which the duty of decision by rightbelonged, gave itself, as usual, no concern about theseaffairs. A rupture took place; Adherbal and Hiempsal pro­bably asserted that their father's testament was surrep­titious and altogether disputed Jugurtha's right of jointinheritance, while on the other hand Jugurtha cameforward as a pretender to the whole kingdom. While thediscussions as to the partition were still going on, Hiempsalwas made away with by hired assassins ; then a civil war arosebetween Adherbal and Jugurtha, in which all Numidia tookpart. With his less numerous but better disciplined andbetter led troops Jugurtha conquered, and seized the wholeterritory of the kingdom, subjecting the chiefs who adheredto his cousin to the most cruel persecutions. Adherbalescaped to the Roman province and proceeded to Rome tomake his complaint there. Jugurtha had. expected this, andhad made his arrangements to meet the threatened inter­vention. In the camp before Numantia he had learnedmore from Rome than a mere lesson in tactics; theNumidian prince, introduced to the circles of the Romanaristocracy, had at the same time been initiated into theintrigues of Roman coteries, and had studied at the fountain-head what might be expected of Roman nobles. Even then,sixteen years before Micipsa's death, he had entered into dis­loyal negotiations as to the Numidian succession with nobleRoman comrades, and Scipio had been under the necessityof gravely reminding him that it was becoming in foreignprinces to be on terms of friendship with the Romanstate rather than with individual Roman citizens.

The new commander-in-chief, Gaius Marius, appeared Roman do.in 650 beyond the Alps, followed by a number of expe- fensl.^f;rienced officers—among whom the bold captor of Jugurtha,Lucius Sulla, soon acquired fresh distinction—and by anumerous host of Italian and allied soldiers. At first hedid not find the enemy against whom he had been sent.The singular people, who had conquered at Arausio, had inthe mean time (as we have already mentioned), after plunder­ing the country to the west of the Rhone, crossed the Pyre­nees and were carrying on a desultory warfare in Spainwith the brave inhabitants of the northern coast and of theinterior; it seemed as if the Germans wished at their veryfirst appearance on the historic stage to display their wantof persevering grasp. So Marius found ample time on theone hand to reduce the revolted Tectosages to obedience,to confirm afresh the wavering fidelity of the subject Gallicand Ligurian cantons, and to obtain support and contin­gents within and without the Roman province from the allieswho were equally with the Romans placed in peril by theCimbri, such as the Massiliots, the Allobroges, and theSequani; and on the other hand, to discipline the armyintrusted to him by strict superintendence and impartialjustice towards noble and ignoble, and to prepare the soldiersfor the more serious labours of war by marches and exten­sive works of entrenching—particularly the construction ofa canal of the Rhone, afterwards handed over to the Mas­siliots, for facilitating the passage of the transports sentfrom Italy to the army. He maintained a strictly defensiveattitude, and did not cross the bounds of toe Roman pro­vince. At length, apparently in the course of 651, the wave 108.of the Cimbri, after having broken itself in Spain on thebrave resistance of the native tribes and especially of theCeltiberians, flowed back again over the Pyrenees andthence, as it appears, passed along the shore of the AtlanticOcean, where everything from the Pyrenees to the Seinesubmitted to the terrible invaders. There, on the confinesof the brave confederacy of the Belgae, they first encounteredserious resistance; but thero also, while they were in theterritory of the Vellocassi (near Rouen), considerable rein­forcements reached them.

More readable and adroit imitations of Greek tragedy Accius.were furnished by Pacuvius' younger contemporary, LuciusAccius, son of a freedman of Pisaurum (584—after 651), 170-103.with the exception of Pacuvius the only notable tragic poetof the seventh century. An active author also in the fieldof literary history and grammar, he doubtless laboured tointroduce instead of the crude manner of his predecessorsgreater purity of language and style into Latin tragedy;jet his inequality and incorrectness were emphatically cen­sured by men of strict observance like Lueilius.
Far greater activity and far more important results are Greekapparent in the field of comedy. At the very commence- comedy,ment of this period a remarkable reaction set in against thesort of comedy hitherto prevalent and popular. Its repre- Terence,sentative Tereutius (558-595) is one of the most interest- 196-159.ing phenomena, in a historical point of view, in Romanliterature. Born in Phoenician Africa, brought in early youthas a slave to Rome and there initiated into the Greek cul­ture of the day, he seemed from the very first destined forthe vocation of restoring to the new Attic comedy that cos­mopolitan character, which in its adaptation to the Romanpublic under the rough hands of Naevius, Plautus, and theirassociates it had in some measure lost. Even in the selec­tion and employment of models the contrast is apparentbetween him and that predecessor whom alone we can nowcompare with him. Plautus chooses his pieces from thewhole range of the newer Attic comedy, and by no meansdisdains the livelier and more popular comedians, such asPhilemon; Terence keeps almost exclusively to Menander,the most elegant, polished, and chaste of all the poets of theNewer comedy. The method of working up several Greekpieces into one Latin is retained by Terence, because in factfrom the state of the case it could not be avoided by theRoman editors; but it is handled with incomparably moreskill and carefulness. The Plautine dialogue beyond doubtdeparted very frequently from its models; Terence boastsof the verbal adherence of his imitations to the originals,by which however we are not to understand a verbaltranslation in our sense. The not unfrequently coarse,but always effective laying on of Roman local tints overthe Greek ground-work, which Plautus was fond of, iscompletely and designedly banished from Terence; not anallusion puts one in mind of Rome, not a proverb, hardly

period it amounted to almost £860,000 (ii. 331,382) and wasdoubtless constantly on the increase.
All these facts taken together certainly lead to the infer­ence that the position of the Roman finances at this epochwas on the whole favourable. Only we may not in a financialpoint of view overlook the fact that, while the governmentduring the two earlier thirds of this period executed splendidand magnificent buildings, it neglected to make other outlays"at least as necessary. We have already indicated how un­satisfactory were its military arrangements; the frontiercountries and even the valley of the Po (P. 175) were pillagedby barbarians, and bands of robbers made havoc in the in­terior even of Asia Minor, Sicily, and Italy. The fleet wastotally neglected; there was hardly any longer a Romanvessel of war; and the vessels, which the subject cities wererequired to build and maintain, were not sufficient, so thatRome was not only absolutely unable to carry on a navalwar, but was not even in a position to check the tradeof piracy. In Rome itself a number of the most neces­sary improvements were left untouched, and the river-build­ings in particular were singularly neglected. The capitalstill possessed no other bridge over the Tiber than the pri­mitive wooden gangway, which led over the Tiber islandto the Janiculum; the Tiber was still allowed to lay thestreets every year under water, and to demolish houses andin fact not unfrequently whole districts, without anythingbeing done to strengthen the banks; mighty as was thegrowth of transmarine trade, the roadstead of Ostia—al­ready by nature bad—was allowed to become more and moresanded up. A government, which under the most favour­able circumstances and in an epoch of forty years of peaceabroad and at home neglected such duties, might easily allowtaxes to fall into abeyance and yet obtain an annual surplusof income over expenditure and a considerable reserve; butsuch a financial administration by no means deserves com­mendation for its mere semblance of brilliant results, butrather merits the same censure—in respect of laxity, want ofcentral management, mistaken flattery of the people—asfalls to be brought in every other sphere of political lifeagainst the senatorial government of this epoch.

demonstrated, not only that the political struggles had reachedthe point at which nothing save open and direct force provesdecisive, but also that the power of the bludgeon was of noavail against the power of the sword. It was the conserva­tive party which first drew the sword, and which accord­ingly in due time experienced the truth of the ominoussaying of the Gospel as to those who first have recourse to it.For the present they triumphed completely and might put thevictory into formal shape at their own pleasure. As a matterof course, the Sulpician laws were characterized as legallynull. Their author and his most notable adherents hadfled; they were, twelve in number, proscribed by the senateto be arrested and executed as enemies of their country.Death of Publius Sulpicius was accordingly seized at Laurentum andSulpicius. pUt to death ; and the head of the tribune, sent to Sulla, wasby his orders exposed in the Forum at the very rostra wherehe himself had stood but a few days before in the full vigourof youth and eloquence. The rest of the proscribed were pur­sued; the assassins were on the track of even the old GaiusFlight of Marius. Although the general might have clouded thememory of his glorious days by a succession of pitiful pro­ceedings, now that the deliverer of his country was runningfor his life, he was once more the victor of Vercellae, and withbreathless suspense all Italy listened to the incidents of hismarvellous flight. At Ostia he had gone on board a trans­port with the view of sailing for Africa; but adverse windsand want of provisions compelled him to land at the Circeianpromontory and to wander at random. With few attendantsand without trusting himself to a roof, the grey-haired con­sular, often suffering from hunger, found his way on foot tothe neighbourhood of the Roman colony of Hinturnae at themouth of the Garigliano. There the pursuing cavalry wereseen in the distance; with great difficulty he reached thecoast and a trading-vessel lying there withdrew him fromhis pursuers; but the timid mariners soon put him ashoreagain and made off, while Marius stole along the beach.His pursuers found him in the salt-marsh of Minturuaesunk to the girdle in the mud and with his head concealedamidst a quantity of reeds, and delivered him to the civicauthorities of Minturnae.

It is easy to form a general conception of the aspect whichwith such economic conditions the social relations must havepresented; but to follow out in detail the increase of luxury,of prices, of fastidiousness and frivolity is neither pleasantnor instructive. Extravagance and sensual enjoyment formedthe main object with all, among the parvenus as well asamong the Licinii and Metelli; not the polished luxurywhich is the acme of civilization, but that sort of luxurywhich had developed itself amidst the decaying Helleniccivilization of Asia Minor and Alexandria, which degradedeverything beautiful and significant to the purpose of deco­ration and studied enjoyment with a laborious pedantry, aprecise punctiliousness, rendering it equally nauseous to theman of fresh feeling as to the man of fresh intellect. As tothe popular festivals, the importation of transmarine beastsof prey prohibited in the time of Cato (ii. 412) was, appa­rently about the middle of this century, formally permittedanew by a decree of the burgesses proposed by GnaeusAufidius; the effect of which was, that animal hunts cameinto enthusiastic favour and formed a chief feature of theburgess-festivals. Several lions first appeared in the Somanarena about 651, the first elephants about 655; Sulla whenpraetor exhibited a hundred lions in 661. The same holdstrue of gladiatorial games. If the forefathers had pub­licly exhibited representations of great battles, their grand­children began to do the same with their gladiatorial games,and by means of such leading and public performances of theage to make themselves a laughing-stock to their descendants.What sums were spent on these and on funeral solemnitiesgenerally, may be inferred from the testament of MarcusJEmilius Lepidus (consul in 567, 579; + 602); he gaveorders to his children, forasmuch as true honour at lastconsisted not in empty pomp but in the remembrance ofpersonal and ancestral merits, to expend on his funeral notmore than 1,000,000 asses (£10,200). Luxury was on theincrease also as respected houses and gardens; the splendidtown house of the orator Crassus (+ 663), famous espe­cially for the old trees of its garden, was valued with thetrees at 6,000,000 of sesterces (£61,500) without them atthe half; while the value of an ordinary dwelling-housein Rome may be estimated perhaps at 60,000 sesterces

To relieve his hard-pressed native town,Judacilius appeared before Asculum with the Picentinelevy and attacked the besieging army, while at the sametime the garrison sallied forth and threw itself on the Romanlines. It is said that 75,000 Romans fought on this dayagainst 60,000 Italians. Victory remained with the Romans,but Judacilius succeeded in throwing himself with a part ofthe relieving army into the town. The siege resumed itscourse; it was protracted* by the strength of the place andthe desperate defence of the inhabitants, who fought witha recollection of the terrible declaration of war within itswalls. When Judacilius at length after a brave defence ofseveral months saw the day of capitulation approach, heordered the chiefs of that fraction of the citizens which wasfavourable to Rome to be put to death under torture, andthen died by his own hand. So the gates were opened, and and con-Roman executions were substituted for Italian; all officers ilu»r»d-and all the respectable citizens were executed, the rest weredriven forth to beggary, and all their property was confiscatedon account of the state. During the siege and after the fallof Asculum numerous Roman corps marched through theadjacent rebel districts, and induced one after another to Subjuga-submit.

honesty of life asserts itself in antagonism to the greatBabel of mingled tongues and corrupt morals. The as­piration of the Scipionic circle after literary correctness,especially in point of language, finds critically its mostfinished and most gifted representative in Lucilius. Hededicated his very first book to Lucius Stilo the fouuder ofRoman philology (P. 442), and designated as the public for'which he wrote not the cultivated circles of pure and clas­sical speech, but the Tarentines, the Bruttians, the Siculi,or in other words the half-Greeks of Italy, whose Latincertainly might well require a corrective. Whole books ofhis poems are occupied with the settlement of Latin ortho­graphy and prosody, with the combating of Praenestine,Sabine, Etruscan provincialisms, with the exposure ofcurrent solecisms; along with which, however, the poet byno means forgets to ridicule the insipidly systematic Isocra-tean purism of words and phrases,* and even to reproach hisfriend Scipio in serious jest with the exclusive fineness ofhis languagcf But the poet inculcates purity of morals inpublic and private life far more earnestly than he preachespure and simple Latinity. Tor this his position gave himpeculiar advantages. Although by descent, estate, andculture on a level with the noble Romans of his time andpossessor of a handsome house in the capital, he was yetnot a Roman burgess, but a Latin; even his positiontowards Scipio, under whom he had served in his earlyyouth during the Numantine war, and in whose house hewas a frequent visitor, may be connected with the fact, thatScipio stood in varied relations to the Latins and was theirpatron in the political feuds of the time (P. 103). He wasthus precluded from a public life, and he disdained thecareer of a speculator—he had no desire, as he once said, tocease to be Lucilius in order to become an Asiatic revenue-farmer. So he lived in the sultry age of the Gracchan re­forms and the agitations preceding the Social war, frequent­ing the palaces and villas of the Roman grandees and yet notexactly their client, at once immersed in the strife of political

By land also the siege made no progress: after apart of the works had been destroyed, Mithradates aban­doned the enterprise, arid the important island as well as themainland opposite remained in the hands of the Romans.
But not only was the Asiatic province occupied by Mith­radates almost without defending itself, chiefly through theSulpician revolution breaking out at a most unfavourabletime; Mithradates even directed an attack against Europe.Already since 662 the neighbours of Macedonia on hernorthern and eastern frontier had been repeating theirincursions with remarkable ardour and perseverance; in theyears 664, 665 the Thracians overran Macedonia and allEpirus and plundered the temple of Dodoua. Still moresingular was the circumstance, that with these movementswas combined a renewed attempt to place a pretender onthe Macedonian throne in the person of one Euphenes.Mithradates, who by way of the Crimea maintained connec­tions with the Thracians, was hardly a stranger to all theseevents. The praetor Gaius Sentius defended himself, it istrue, against these intruders with the aid of the ThracianDentheletae; but it was not long before mightier opponentscame against him. Mithradates, carried away by his suc­cesses, had formed the bold resolution that he would, likeAntiochus, bring the war for the sovereignty of Asia to adecision in Greece, and had by land and sea directedthither the flower of his troops. His son Ariarathespenetrated from Thrace into the weakly-defended Mace­donia, subduing the country as he advanced and parcellingit into Pontic satrapies. Abdera and Philippi became theprincipal bases for the operations of the Pontic arms inEurope. The Pontic fleet, commanded by Mithradates'best general Archelaus, appeared in the jEgean sea, wherescarce a Roman sail was to be found. Delos, the emporium

age in which they appeared, there was no observer whodeemed it worth while accurately to describe the marvellousmeteor. When men afterwards began to trace the chain,of which this emigration, the first Germanic movement whichtouched the orbit of ancient civilization, was a link, thedirect and living knowledge of it had long passed away.
This homeless people of the Cimbri, which hitherto had Cimbrianbeen prevented from advancing to the south by the Celts on movementsthe Danube, more especially by the Boii, broke through °"d con"that barrier in consequence of the attacks directed by theRomans against the Danubian Celts; either because thelatter invoked the aid of their Cimbrian antagonists againstthe advancing legions, or because the Roman attack pre­vented them from protecting as hitherto their northern fron­tiers. Advancing through the territory of the Scordisci Defeat ofinto the Tauriscan country, they approached in 641 the Carbo.passes of the Carnian Alps, to protect which the consul 113-Gnaeus Papirius Carbo took up a position on the heights notfar from Aquileia. Here, seventy years before, Celtic tribesbad attempted to settle on the south of the Alps, but at thebidding of the Romans had evacuated without resistance theground which they had already occupied (ii. 196); even nowthe dread of the Transalpine peoples at the Roman nameshowed itself powerfully. The Cimbri did not attack; in­deed, when Carbo ordered them to evacuate the territoryof the Taurisci wio were in relations of hospitality withRome—an order which the treaty with the latter by no meansbound him to make—they complied and followed the guideswhom Carbo had assigned to them to escort them over thefrontier. But these guides were in fact instructed to lurethe Cimbri into an ambush, where the consul awaited them.Accordingly an engagement took place not far from Noreiain the modern Cariuthia, in which the betrayed gained thevictory over the betrayer and inflicted on him considerableloss; a storm, which separated the combatants, alone pre­vented the complete annihilation of the Roman army.The Cimbri might have immediately directed their attacktowards Italy; they preferred to turn to the westward.By treaty with the Helvetii and the Sequani rather than byforce of arms they made their way to the left bank of theRhine and over the Jura, and there some years after Carbo'sdefeat once more threatened the Roman territory by their im­mediate vicinity.

also foreign nationalities—the Transalpine Gauls, theSyrians ; above all, the various trades frequently appear onthe boards. The sacristan, the soothsayer, the bird-seer,the physician, the publican, the painter, fisherman, baker,pass across the stage: the criers were severely assailed andstill more the fullers, who seem to have played in theRoman fool-world the part of our tailors. While thevaried life of the city thus received its due attention, thefarmer with his joys and sorrows was also represented inall aspects. The copiousness of this rural repertory may beguessed from the numerous titles of that nature, such as"the Cow," "the Ass," "the Kid," "the Sow," "theSwine," "the Sick Boar," "the Farmer," "the Country­man," "Harlequin Countryman," "the Cattle-herd,""the Vinedresser," "the Figgatherer," "Woodcutting,""Pruning," "the Poultry-yard." In these pieces it wasalways the standing figures of the stupid and the artfulservant, the good old man, the wise man, that delighted thepublic; the first in particular might never be wanting—the Pulcinello of this farce—the gluttonous filthy Maccus,hideously ugly and yet eternally in love, always on the pointof stumbling across his own path, set upon by all with jeersand with blows and eventually at the close the regularscapegoat. The titles "Maccus Miles," "Maccus Copo,""Maccus Virgo," "Maccus Exul," "Macci Gemini" may fur­nish the good-humoured reader with some conception of thevariety of entertainment in the Roman masquerade. Al­though these farces, at least after they came to be written,accommodated themselves to the general laws of literature,and in their metres for instance followed the Greek stage,they yet naturally retained a far more Latin and more po­pular stamp than even the national comedy. The farceresorted to the Greek world only under the form of travestiedtragedy;* and this species appears to have been cultivatedfirst by Novius, and not very frequently in any case.

(about 609).The public But this hostility between the formal sovereignty of theelections- people and the practically subsisting constitution was ingreat part a semblance. Party phrases were in free circula­tion; of the parties themselves there was little trace inmatters really and directly practical. Throughout the wholeseventh century the annual public elections to the civilmagistracies, especially to the consulship and. censorship,formed the real standing question of the day and the focusof political agitation; but it was only in isolated and rareinstances that the different candidates represented oppositepolitical principles; ordinarily the question related purelyto persons, and it was for the course of affairs a matter ofindifference whether the majority of the votes fell to a Ca;ci-lian or to a Cornelian. The Romans thus lacked that whichoutweighs and compensates all the evils of party-life—thefree and common movement of the masses towards what theydiscern as a befitting aim—and yet endured all those evilssolely for the benefit of the paltry game of the ruling coteries.It was comparatively easy for the Roman noble to enter on thecareer of office as quaestor or tribune of the people; but theconsulship and the censorship were attainable by him onlythrough great exertions prolonged for years. The prizeswere many, but those really wortli having were few; thecompetitors ran, as a Roman poet once said, as it wereover a race-course wide at the starting-point but graduallynarrowing its dimensions. This was right so long as themagistracy was—what it was called—an " honour," and menof military, political, or juristic ability were rival competitorsfor the rare chaplets; but now the practical exclusiveness ofthe nobility did away with the benefit of competition, andleft only its disadvantages. With few exceptions the youngmen belonging to the ruling families crowded into thepolitical career, and their impetuous and premature ambitionsoon caught at means more effective than useful action forthe public good.

praised and beloved during his lifetime, he spent in literary-leisure his remaining days. And this disgraceful condemna­tion, while perhaps the worst, was by no means the onlycase of the sort. The senatorial party was exasperated, notso much perhaps by such an abuse of justice in the case ofmen of stainless walk but of new nobility, as by the fact thatthe purest nobility no longer sufficed to cover possible stainson its honour. Scarcely was Rufus out of the country,when the most respected of all aristocrats, for twenty yearsthe chief of the senate, Marcus Scaurus at seventy years ofage was brought to trial for exactions; a sacrilege accordingto aristocratic notions, even if he were guilty. The officeof accuser began to be exercised professionally by worthlessfellows, and neither irreproachable character, nor rank, norage longer furnished protection from the most wicked andmost dangerous attacks. The commission regarding exac­tions was converted from a shield of the provincials intotheir worst scourge; the most notorious robber escaped withimpunity, if he only indulged his fellow-robbers and did notrefuse to allow part of the sums exacted to reach the jury;but any attempt to respond to the equitable demands ofthe provincials for right and justice sufficed for condemna­tion. It seemed as if the intention was to bring the Romangovernment into the same dependence on the controllingcourt, as that in which the college of judges at Carthagehad formerly kept the council there.

Afterthe crisis occasioned by that war in Hellas he was carriedoff along with the other Achaean hostages to Italy (ii. 310),167-150. where he lived in exile for seventeen years (587-604) andwas introduced by the sons of Paullus to the leading circlesof the capital.

When they learned this,the magistrates of Minturnae were ashamed that the delivererof Rome should meet with greater reverence from slaves towhom he had brought servitude than from his fellow-citizensto whom he had brought freedom; they loosed his fetters,gave him a vessel and money for travelling expenses, andsent him to .Enaria (Ischia). The proscribed with theexception of Sulpicius gradually met in those waters; theylanded at Eryx and at what was formerly Carthage, but theRoman magistrates both in Sicily and in Africa sent themaway. So they escaped to Numidia, whose sandy desertsgave them a place of refuge for the winter. But the kingHiempsal II., whom they hoped to gain and who had seemedfor a time willing to unite with them, had only done so tolull them into security, and now attempted to seize theirpersons. With great difficulty the fugitives escaped fromhis cavalry, and found a temporary refuge in the little islandof Kerkina (Kerkena) on the coast of Tunis. We know not,whether Sulla thanked his fortunate star that he had beenspared the odium of putting to death the victor of the Cim-brians; at any rate it does not appear that the magistratesof Minturnae were punished.

except that, as might be expected, the sophists made warmore against the popular faith, Carneades and his disciplesmore against their philosophical colleagues. On the otherhand Epicurus and Zeno agreed both in their aim of ration­ally explaining the nature of things, and in their physiolo­gical method, which set out from the idea of matter. Theydiverged, in so far as Epicurus, following the atomic theoryof Democritus, conceived the first principle as rigid matter,and evolved the manifoldness of things out of this mattermerely by mechanical variations; whereas Zeno, forming hisviews after the Ephesian Heraclitus, introduces even intohis primordial matter a dynamic antagonism and a move­ment of fluctuation up and down. From this are derived thefurther distinctions—that in the Epicurean system the godsas it were did not exist or were' at the most a dream ofdreams, while the Stoical gods formed the ever active soulof the world, and were as spirit, as sun, as God powerfulover the body, the earth, and nature; that Epicurus did not,while Zeno did, recognize a government of the world and apersonal immortality of the soul; that the proper object ofhuman aspiration was according to Epicurus an absoluteequilibrium disturbed neither by bodily desire nor by mentalconflict, while it was according to Zeno a manly activityalways increased by the constant antagonistic efforts of themind and body, and striving after a harmony with natureperpetually in conflict and perpetually at peace. But inone point all these schools were agreed with reference toreligion, that faith as such was nothing, and had necessarilyto be supplemented by reflection—whether this reflectionmight consciously despair of attaining any result, as did theAcademy, or might reject the conceptions of the popularfaith, as did the school of Epicurus, or might partly retainthem with explanation of the reasons for doing so, andpartly modify them, as did the Stoics.
It was accordingly only natural, that the first contactof Hellenic philosophy with the Roman nation equally strongin faith and adverse to speculation was of a thoroughly hos­tile character. The Roman religion was entirely right indisdaining alike the assaults and the theoretic support ofthese philosophical systems, both of which did away with itsproper character.

The villas, and the luxurious ruraland sea-bathing life, rendered Baiae and generally the districtaround the Bay of Naples the El Dorado of noble idleness.Games of hazard, in which the stake was not any more than Games,in the Italian dice-playing a trifle, became common, and asearly as 639 a censorial edict was issued against them. 115.Gauze fabrics, which displayed rather than concealed the Dress.figure, and silken clothing began to displace the old woollendresses among women and even among men.

But the real focus in The table,which the brilliance of this genteel life was concentrated wasthe table. Extravagant prices—as much as 100,000 ses­terces (£1050)—were paid for an exquisite cook. Houseswere constructed with special reference to this object, andthe villas in particular along the coast were provided withsalt-water tanks of their own, in order that they might fur­nish marine fishes and oysters at any time fresh to the table.A dinner was already described as poor, at which the fowlswere served up to the guests entire and not the choice por­tions merely, and at which the guests were expected to eat ofthe several dishes and not simply to taste them.

At table above all the Romans displayed theirhost of slaves ministering to luxury, their bands of musicians,their dancing-girls, their elegant furniture, their carpetsglittering with gold or pictorially embroidered, their purplehangings, their antique bronzes, their rich silver plate.Against such displays the sumptuary laws were primarilydirected, which were issued more frequently (593, 639, 665, 161. l II673) and in greater detail than ever; a number of delicacies 89. 81.and wines were therein totally prohibited, for others a maxi-

but, while the Phoenicians yielded from despair, the king ofSinope did the very opposite and assembled his troops andships.

Hisson Arioljarzanes received orders to advance into Cappadocia;a message was sent once more to the Roman envoys to informthem of the step to which necessity had driven the king,and to demand their ultimatum. It was to the effect whichwas to be anticipated. Although neither the Roman senatenor king Mithradates nor king Nicomedes had desired therupture, Aquillius desired it and war ensued (end of 665). 89.
Mithradates prosecuted the political and military prepara- Prepara­tions for the passage of arms thus forced upon him with all his tions ofcharacteristic energy. First of all he drew closer his alliance M1thrada-with Tigranes king of Armenia, and obtained from him thepromise of an auxiliary army, which was to march into ante­rior Asia and to take possession of the soil there for kingMithradates and of the moveable property for king Tigranes.The Parthian king offended by the haughty carriage of Sulla,though not exactly coming forward as an antagonist to theRomans, did not act as their ally. To the Greeks the kingendeavoured to present himself in the character of Philipand Perseus, as the defender of the Greek nation against thealien yoke of the Romans. Pontic envoys were sent to theking of Egypt and to the last remnant of free Greece, theleague of the Cretan cities, and adjured those for whom Romehad already forged her chains to rise now at the last momentand save Hellenic nationality; the attempt was in the caseof Crete at least not wholly in vain, and numerous Cretanstook service in the Pontic army. Hopes were entertainedthat the lesser and least of the protected states—Numidia,Syria, the Hellenic republics—would successively rebel, andthat the provinces would revolt, particularly anterior Asia,the victim of unbounded oppression. Efforts were made toexcite a Thracian rising, and even to arouse Macedonia torevolt.

from Gaius Gracchus. The institutions of Gracchus stood,for the moment at least, immoveably firm with the exceptionof a single one—his own supremacy. The weakness of thelatter lay in the fact, that in the constitution of Gracchusthere subsisted no relations of allegiance at all between thechief and the army; and, while the new constitution possessedall other elements of vitality, it lacked one—the moral bondbetween ruler and ruled—without which every state rests ona pedestal of clay. In the rejection of the proposal toadmit the Latins to the franchise it had been demonstratedwith decisive clearness, that the multitude in fact never votedfor Gracchus, but always simply for itself. The aristocracyconceived the plan of offering battle to the author of thecorn-largesses and land-assignations on his own ground.
As a matter of course, the senate offered to the prole- Rival dema-tariate not merely the same advantages as Gracchus had S°Psm ot'already assured to it in corn and otherwise, but advantages !ie s£na,e-still greater.

Itmay be conjectured that the Latins were named as thepersons at whose expense the plan was to be carried out, forthere does not appear to have now existed in Italy any otheroccupied domain-land of any extent save that which was en­ioyed by them.

zealous champions of Adherbal's just title were withincredible rapidity convinced, that Hiempsal had been putto death by his subjects on account of his cruelty, andthat the author of the war as to the succession was notJugurtha, but Adherbal. Even the leading men in thesenate were shocked at the scandal; Marcus Scaurus soughtto check it, but in vain. The senate passed over what hadtaken place in silence, and ordained that the two survivingtestamentary heirs should have the kingdom equally dividedbetween them, and that, for the prevention of iresh quarrels,the division should be undertaken by a commission of thesenate. This was done: the consular Lucius Opimius, well-known through his services in setting aside the revolution,had embraced the opportunity of gathering the reward ofhis patriotism, and had got himself placed at the head of thecommission. The division turned out thoroughly in favourof Jugurtha, and not to the disadvantage of the commis­sioners; Cirta (Constantine) the capital with its port ofEusicade (Philippeville) was no doubt given to Adherbal,but by that very arrangement the portion which fell to himwas the eastern part of the kingdom consisting almostwholly of sandy deserts, while Jugurtha obtained the fertileand populous western half (what was afterwards MauretaniaCaesariensis and Sitifensis).
This was bad; but matters soon became worse. In order Siege ofto be able under the semblance of self-defence to defraud Cirta.Adherbal of his portion, Jugurtha provoked him to war; butwhen the weak man, rendered wiser by experience, allowedJugurtha's horsemen to ravage his territory unhinderedand contented himself with lodging complaints at Rome,Jugurtha, impatient of ceremony, began the war evenwithout pretext. Adherbal was totally defeated in theregion of the modern Philippeville, and threw himself intohis capital of Cirta in the immediate vicinity.

the history of the states of the Mediterranean resolving itselfinto the hegemony of Roman power and Greek culture.Thus Polybius became the first Greek of note, who embracedwith serious conviction the comprehensive view of the Sci-pionic circle, and recognized the ascendancy of Hellas in thesphere of intellect and that of Rome in the sphere of politicsas facts, regarding which history had given her final decision,and to which people on both sides were entitled and boundto submit. In this spirit he acted as a practical statesman,and wrote his history. If in his youth he had done homageto the honourable but impracticable local patriotism of theAchaeans, during his later years, with a clear discernment ofinevitable necessity, he. advocated in the community to whichhe belonged the policy of the closest adherence to Rome.It was a policy in the highest degree judicious and beyonddoubt well-intentioned, but it was far from being high-spiritedor proud. Nor was Polybius able wholly to disengage himselffrom the vanity and paltriness of the Hellenic statesmanshipof the time. He was hardly released from exile, when heproposed to the senate that it should formally secure to thereleased their former rank in their several homes; where­upon Cato aptly remarked, that that looked to him as ifUlysses were to return to the cave of Polyphemus to requestfrom the giant his hat and girdle. He often availed himselfof his relations with the great men in Rome to benefit hiscountrymen; but the way in which he submitted to, andboasted of, the illustrious protection somewhat approachesfawning servility. His literary activity breathes throughoutthe same spirit as his practical action. It was the task ofhis life to write the history of the union of the Mediterraneanstates under the hegemony of Rome. From the first Punicwar down to the destruction of Carthage and Corinth hiswork embraces the fortunes of all the civilized states,—namely Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt,Carthage, and Italy—and exhibits in causal connection themode in which they came under the Roman protectorate; inso far he describes it as his object to demonstrate the fitnessand reasonableness of the Roman hegemony. In design asin execution, this history stands in clear and distinct con­trast with the contemporary Roman as well as with thecontemporary Greek historiography.

Critolaus at last appeared alone and informed them that thegeneral assembly of the Achaeans was alone competent inthis matter, and that it could only be settled at the diet or,in other words, in six months. Caesar thereupon returnedto Rome; and the next national assembly of the Achaeans onthe proposal of Critolaus formally declared war against Sparta.Even now Metellus made an attempt amicably to settle thequarrel, and sent envoys to Corinth; but the noisy ecclesia,consisting mostly of the mob of that wealthy commercialand manufacturing city, drowned the voice of the Romanenvoys and compelled them to leave the platform. Thedeclaration of Critolaus, that they wished the Romans to betheir friends but not their masters, was received with inex­pressible delight; and, when the members of the diet wishedto interpose, the mob protected the man after its own heart,and applauded the sarcasms as to the high treason ofthe rich and the need of a military dictatorship as well asthe mysterious hints regarding an impending insurrection ofnumerous peoples and kings against Rome. The spiritanimating the movement is shown by the two resolutions,that all clubs should be permanent and that all actions fordebt should be suspended till the restoration of peace.
The Achaeans thus had war; and they had even actualallies, namely the Thebans and Boeotians and also the Chal-cidians. At the beginning of 608 the Achaeans advanced 146.into Thessaly to reduce to obedience Heraclea near Oeta,which, in accordance with the decree of the senate, haddetached itself from the Achaean league. The consul LuciusMuminius, whom the senate had resolved to send toGreece, had not yet arrived; accordingly Metellus under­took to protect Heraclea with the Macedonian legions.When the advance of the Romans was announced to theAchaeo-Theban army, there was no more talk of fighting;they considered only how they might best succeed in reachingonce more the secure Peloponnesus; in all haste the armymade off, and did not even attempt to hold the position ofThermopylae. But Metellus quickened the pursuit, and over­took and defeated the Greek army near Scarpheia in Locris.The loss in prisoners and dead was considerable; Critolauswas never heard of after the battle.

to be powerful connections; and therefore that careerbegan, not as formerly in the camp, but in the ante-chambersof influential men. A new and noble body of clients nowundertook—what had formerly been done only by depend­ents and freedmen—to come and wait on their patron earlyin the morning, and to appear publicly in his train. But thepopulace also was a great lord, and desired as such to receiveattention. The rabble began to demand as its right thatthe future consul should recognize and honour the sovereignpeople in every ragged idler of the street, and that everycandidate should in his "going round" (ambitus) saluteevery individual voter by name and press his hand. Thenoble world entered readily into this degrading canvass.The true candidate cringed not only in the palace, but alsoon the street, and recommended himself to the multitude byflattering attentions, indulgences, and civilities more or lessrefined. Demagogism and the cry after reforms were sedu­lously employed to attract the notice and favour of the public;and they were all the more effective, that they attackednot things but persons. It became the custom for beardlessyouths of noble birth to introduce themselves with eclat intopublic life by playing afresh the part of Cato with theimmature passion of their boyish eloquence, and by con­stituting and proclaiming themselves state-prosecutors, ifpossible, against some man of very high standing and greatunpopularity; the Romans suffered the grave institutions ofcriminal justice and of political police to become a means ofsoliciting office. The provision or, what was still worse, thepromise of magnificent popular amusements had long beenthe, as it were legal, prerequisite to the obtaining of theconsulship (ii. 346) ; now the votes of the electors began tobe directly purchased with money, as the prohibition issuedagainst it about 595 shows. Perhaps the worst consequence 159.of the continual courting of the favour of the multitude bythe ruling aristocracy, was the incompatibility of such abegging and fawning part with the position which the govern­ment should rightfully occupy in relation to the governed.The government was thus converted from a blessing intoa curse for the people. They no longer ventured to disposeof the property and blood of the burgesses, as exigency re­quired, for the good of their country. They allowed theBurgesses to become habituated to the dangerous idea thatthey were legally exempt from the payment of direct taxes

87. of 667 has been already described; the half-suppressed insur­rection, the principal army under the more than half-usurpedcommand of a general whose politics were very doubtful,the confusion and the manifold activity of intrigue in thecapital. The victory of the oligarchy by force of arms had,in spite or because of its moderation, made various classesdiscontented. The capitalists, painfully affected by the blowsof the most severe financial crisis which Rome had yetwitnessed, were indignant at the government on account ofthe law which it had issued as to interest, and on accountof the Italian and Asiatic wars which it had not pre­vented. The insurgents, so far as they had laid down theirarms, bewailed not only the disappointment of their proudhope that they would obtain equal rights with the rulingburgesses, but also the forfeiture of their venerable treatiesand their new position as subjects utterly destitute of rights.The communities between the Alps and the Po were like­wise discontented with the partial concessions made to them,and the new burgesses and freedmen were exasperated bythe cancelling of the Sulpician laws. The populace of thecity suffered amid the general distress, and found it intolera­ble that the government of the sabre was no longer disposedto acquiesce in the constitutional rule of the bludgeon.

In Samnium Silo no Venusia-doubt succeeded in retaking Bovianum; but in a battle, inwhich he engaged the Roman general Mamercus ^Emilius,the Romans conquered, and—what was more important thanthe victory itself—Silo was among the 6000 dead whom Fall of Silo,the Samnites left on the field. In Campania the smallerplaces, which the Samnites still occupied, were wrestedfrom them by Sulla, and Nola was invested. The Romangeneral Aulus Gabinius penetrated also into Lucania andgained no small advantages; but, after he had fallen in anattack on the enemy's camp, Lamponius the insurgentleader and his followers once more held almost undisturbedcommand over the wide and desolate Lucano-Bruttian countryand even made an attempt to seize Rhegium, which wasfrustrated, however, by the Sicilian governor Gaius Nor-banus. Notwithstanding isolated mischances the Romanswere constantly drawing nearer to the attainment of theirend; the fall of Nola, the submission of Samnium, the pos­sibility of rendering considerable forces available for Asiaappeared no longer distant, when the turn taken by affairsin the capital unexpectedly gave fresh life to the well-nighextinguished insurrection.
Rome was in a fearful ferment. The attack of Drusus Ferment inupon the equestrian courts and his sudden downfall brought Rome-about by the equestrian party, followed by the two-edgedVarian warfare of prosecutions, had sown the bitterestdiscord between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie as wellas between the moderates and the ultras. Events had com­pletely justified the party of concession; what they had pro­posed voluntarily to bestow, Rome had been more than halfcompelled to concede; but the mode in which the conces­sion was made bore, just like the earlier refusal, the stampof obstinate and shortsighted envy. Instead of grantingequality of rights to all Italian communities, they had onlvexpressed the inferiority in another form. They had re-The bestow-ceived a great number of Italian communities into Roman al°fthecitizenship, but had attached to what they thus conferred an fraj ^*.injurious stigma, by placing the new burgesses alongside of mitations.the old on nearly the same footing as the freedmen occupiedalongside of the freeborn.

But these client statesof Rome had neither independence nor peace. In Africathere practically subsisted a perpetual border-war betweenCarthage and Numidia. In Egypt Roman arbitration hadsettled the dispute as to the succession between the twobrothers Ptolemy Philometor and Ptolemy the Fat;nevertheless the new rulers of Egypt and Cyrene wagedwar for the possession of Cyprus. In Asia not only weremost of the kingdoms—Bithynia, Cappadocia, Syria,—like­wise torn by internal quarrels as to the succession and bythe interventions of neighbouring states to which thesequarrels gave rise, but various and severe wars were carriedon between the Attalids and the Galatians, between theAttalids and the kings of Bithynia, and even betweenRhodes and Crete. In Hellas Proper, in like manner, thepigmy feuds which were customary there continued tosmoulder; and even Macedonia, formerly so tranquil, con­sumed its strength in the intestine strife that arose out ofits new democratic constitution. It was the fault of therulers as well as the ruled, that the last vital energies andthe last prosperity of the nations were expended in theseaimless feuds. The client states ought to have perceivedthat a state which cannot wage war against every one cannotwage war at all, and that, as the position and power enjoyedby all these states were practically under Roman guarantee,they had in the event of any difference no alternative butto settle the matter amicably with their neighbours or tocajl in the Romans as arbiters.

Unhappilybeyond the employment of the mother-tongue there ishardly anything else deserving of commendation in thechronicles of this epoch composed in Latin. They werenumerous and ample enough—there are mentioned, forexample, those of Lucius Cassius Hemina (about 608), 146.of Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul in 621), of Gaius Sem- 133.pronius Tuditanus (consul in 625), of Gaius Eannius (con- 137.sul in 632). To these falls to be added the digest of the 129.official annals of the city in eighty books, which PubliusMucius Scaevola (consul in 621), a man esteemed also as 133.a jurist, prepared and published as pontifex maximus,thereby closing the city-chronicle in so far as thenceforththe pontifical records, although not exactly discontinued,were no longer at any rate, amidst the increasing diligenceof private chroniclers, taken account of in literature. Allthese annals, whether they gave themselves forth as privateor as official works, were substantially similar compilationsof the extant historical and quasi-historical materials; andthe value of their sources as well as their formal valuedeclined beyond doubt in the same proportion as theiramplitude increased. Chronicle certainly nowhere pre­sents truth without fiction, and it would be very foolish toquarrel with Naevius and Pictor because they have notacted otherwise than Hecataeus and Saxo Grammaticus; butthe later attempts to build houses out of such castles in theair severely test even the most tried patience.

These and the ter­rorism of the restoration were the deeds of the aristocracy,and Sulla was nothing more in the matter than, to use thepoet's expression, the executioner's axe following theconscious thought as its unconscious instrument. Sullacarried out that part with rare, in fact superhuman, perfec­tion; but within the limits, which it laid down for him, hisworking was not only grand but even useful. Never hasany aristocracy deeply decayed and decaying still furtherfrom day to day, such as was the Roman aristocracy of thattime, found a guardian so willing and able as Sulla to wieldfor it the sword of the general and the pen of the legislatorwithout any regard to the gain of power for himself. Thereis no doubt a difference between the case of an officer whorefuses the sceptre from public spirit and that of one whothrows it away from ennui; but, so far as concerns the totalabsence of political selfishness—although, it is true, in thisrespect only—Sulla deserves to be named side by side withWashington.Value of But the whole country—and not the aristocracy merely—
the Sullan was more indebted to him than posterity is willing to con­fess. Sulla definitely terminated the Italian revolution, inso far as it was based on the disabilities of individual lessprivileged districts as compared with others of better rights,and, by compelling himself and his party to recognize theequality of the rights of all Italians in presence of the law,he became the real and final author of the full politicalunity of Italy—a gain, which was not too dearly purchasedeven by so many troubles and streams of blood. Sulla how­ever did more. For more than half a century the power ofRome had been declining and anarchy had been her perma­nent condition: for the government of the senate with theGracchan constitution was anarchy, and the government ofCinna and Carbo was a yet far worse illustration of the ab­sence of a master-hand (the sad image of which is mostclearly reflected in that equally confusedand unnatural leaguewith the Samnites), the most indistinct, most intolerable.

Butno one, and least of all he himself, could fail to see thatincreased stringency in the administration of justice andisolated interference were not even first steps towards thehealing of the organic evils under which the state laboured.These Scipio did not touch. Gaius Laelius (consul in 614), 140.Scipio's elder friend and his political instructor and confi­dant, had conceived the plan of proposing the confiscationof the Italian domain land which had not been given awaybut had been provisionally occupied, and of giving relief byits distribution to the visibly decaying Italian farmers; butlie desisted from the project when he saw what a storm hewas going to raise, and was thenceforth named the "judi­cious." Scipio was of the same opinion. He was fullypersuaded of the greatness of the evil, and with a couragedeserving of honour he, without respect of persons, remorse­lessly assailed it and carried his point where he risked him­self alone; but he was also persuaded that the countrycould only be relieved at the price of a revolution similar tothat which in the fourth and fifth centuries had sprung outof the question of reform, and, rightly or wrongly, theremedy seemed to him worse than the disease. So with thesmall circle of his friends he held a middle position betweenthe aristocrats, who never forgave him for his advocacyof the Cassian law, and the democrats, whom he neithersatisfied nor wished to satisfy; solitary during his life, praisedafter his death by both parties, now as the championof the aristocracy, now as the promoter of reform. Downto his time the censors on laying down their office had calledupon the gods to grant greater power and glory to the state;the censor Scipio prayed that they might deign to preservethe state. His whole confession of faith lies in that painfulexclamation.
But, where the man who had twice led the Roman army Tiberiusfrom deep disorganization to victory despaired, a youth with- Gracchus-oat achievements had the boldness to give himself forth asthe saviour of Italy. He was called Tiberius SemproniusGracchus (591-621). His father who bore the same name 163-133.

a very unnecessary way by a meaningless disregard of theconstitutional rules of election. The capitalist party mighthave furnished some support, and it was injured in the mostsensitive point by the law as to debt. The true mainstay ofthe government was—wholly without any co-operation onits part—the new burgesses; their assistance was acquiescedin, but nothing was done to regulate the strange position ofthe Samnites, who were now nominally Roman citizens, butevidently regarded their country's independence as practi­cally the real object and prize of the struggle and remainedin arms to defend it against all and sundry. Illustrioussenators were struck down like mad dogs; but not thesmallest step was taken to reorganize the senate in theinterest of the government, or even permanently to terrifyit; bo that the government was by no means sure of itsaid. Gaius Gracchus had not understood the fall of the oli­garchy as implying that the new master might conduct him­self on his self-created throne, as legitimate cipher-kingsthink proper to do. But this Cinna had been elevated topower not by his will, but by pure accident; was there anywonder, that he remained where the stormy wave of revolu­tion had washed him up, till a second wave came to sweephim away again?
The same union of the mightiest plenitude of power withthe most utter impotence and incapacity in those who heldit, was apparent in the warfare waged by the revolutionarygovernment against the oligarchy—a warfare on which itsexistence primarily depended. In Italy it ruled with abso­lute sway. Of the old burgesses a very large portion wereon principle favourable to democratic views; and the stillgreater mass of quiet people, while disapproving the Marianhorrors, saw in an oligarchic restoration simply the com­mencement of a second reign of terror by the opposite parry.The impression of the outrages of 667 on the nation at largehad been comparatively slight, as they had chiefly affectedthe mere aristocracy of the capital; and it was moreoversomewhat effaced by the three years of tolerably peaceful •government that ensued. Lastly the whole mass of the newburgesses—three-fifths perhaps of the Italians—were de­cidedly, if not favourable to the present government, yetopposed to the oligarchy.

pear, arranged in the order of matters.* A strictly sys­tematic treatment of the law of the land soon followed. Itsfounder was the pontifex maximus Quintus Mucius Scaevola(consul in 650, + 672, P. 219, 336, 432), in whose family 95. 82.jurisprudence was, like the supreme priesthood, hereditary.His eighteen books on the Jus Civile, which embracedthe positive materials of jurisprudence—legislative enact­ments, judicial precedents, and authorities—partly from theolder collections, partly from oral tradition in as great com­pleteness as possible, formed the starting-point and themodel of the complete systems of Roman law; in like man­ner his compendious treatise of " Definitions" (opoi) be­came the basis of juristic summaries and particularly ofthe books of Rules. Although this development of lawproceeded of course in the main independently of Hel­lenism, yet an acquaintance with the philosophico-practicalsystematizing of the Greeks beyond doubt gave a generalimpulse to the more systematic treatment of jurisprudence,as in fact the Greek influence is in the case of the last-mentioned treatise apparent in the very title. We havealready remarked that in several more external mattersRoman jurisprudence was influenced by the Stoa (P. 432).
Art exhibits still less pleasing results. In architecture, Art.sculpture, and painting there was, no doubt, a more andmore general diffusion of a dilettante interest, but theexercise of native art retrograded rather than advanced.It became more and more customary for those sojourningin Grecian lands personally to inspect the works of art; forwhich in particular the winter-quarters of Sulla's army inAsia Minor in 670—671 formed an epoch. Connoisseur- 84-83.ship developed itself also in Italy. They had commenced witharticles in silver and bronze; about the commencement ofthis epoch they began to esteem not merely Greek statues,but also Greek pictures. The first picture publicly exhi­bited in Rome was the Bacchus of Aristides, which LuciusMummius withdrew from the sale of the Corinthian spoil,because king Attalus offered as much as 6000 denarii (£246)for it. The buildings became more splendid; and in parti­cular transmarine, especially Hymettian, marble (Cipollin)

an order of succession to be fixed on each occasion by lot.While these enactments were mainly designed to procurefor the new chief of the state by means of the city-proleta­riate the complete command of' the capital and thereby ofthe state, the amplest control over the comitial machinery,and the power in case of need of striking terror into thesenate and magistrates, the legislator certainly at the sametime set himself with earnestness and energy to redress theexisting social evils. It is true that the Italian domainquestion was in a certain sense settled. The agrarian lawof Tiberius and even the allotment-commission still con­tinued in force; the agrarian law carried by Gracchus canhave enacted nothing new save the restoration to the commis­sioners of the jurisdiction which they had lost. That the objectof this step was only to save the principle, and that the dis­tribution of lands, if resumed at all, was resumed only to avery limited extent, is shown by the burgess-roll, whichgives exactly the same number of persons for the years 629and 639. Gaius beyond doubt did not proceed further inthis matter, because the domain-land intended for distribu­tion by his brother was already in substance distributed, andthe question as to the domains enjoyed by the Latins couldonly be taken up anew in connection with the very difficultquestion as to the extension of Roman citizenship. On theother hand he took an important step beyond the agrarianlaw of Tiberius, when he proposed the establishment ofcolonies in Italy—at Tarentum, and more especially atCapua—and by that course rendered the domain-land, whichhad been let on lease by the state and was hitherto excludedfrom distribution, liable to be also parcelled out, not, how­ever, according to the previous method which did not contem­plate the founding of new communities, but according to thecolonial system (P. 102). Beyond doubt these colonies werealso designed to aid in permanently defending the revolution,to which they owed their existence. Still more significantline coloni- and momentous was the measure, by which Gaius Gracchusration. gr.^ proceeded to provide for the Italian proletariate in.' thetransmarine territories of the state. He despatched to thesite on which Carthage had stood 6000 colonists selectedperhaps not merely from Roman burgesses but also from theItalian allies, and conferred on the new town of Janonia therights of a Roman burgess-colony.

to support his son-in-law against Rome. The Koman army,•which was returning from the river Molochath, found itselfone evening surrounded of a sudden by immense masses ofMauretanian and Numidian cavalry; they were obliged tofight just as the divisions stood without forming in a properorder of battle or following any leading command, and hadto deem themselves fortunate when their sadly-thinned troopswere brought into temporary safety for the night on twohills not far remote from each other. But the culpable neg­ligence of the Africans intoxicated with victory wrested fromthem its consequences; they allowed themselves to be sur­prised in a deep sleep during the morning twilight by theKoman troops which had been in some measure reorganizedduring the night, and were fortunately dispersed. There­upon the Roman army continued its retreat in better orderand with greater caution; but it was yet again assailedsimultaneously on all the four sides and was in great danger,till the cavalry officer Lucius Cornelius Sulla first dispersedthe squadrons opposed to him and then, rapidly returningfrom their pursuit, threw himself also on Jugurtha andBocchus at the point where they in person pressed bard onthe rear of the Roman infantry. Thus this attack also wassuccessfully repelled; Marius brought his army back toCirta, and took up his winter quarters there (648-9).106-105. Strange as it may seem, we can yet understand whyNegotia- the Romans now, after king Bocchus had commenced thetions with war, began to make most zealous exertions to secure hisfriendship, which they had at first slighted and thereafter hadat least not specially sought; by doing so they gainedthis advantage, that no formal declaration of war took placeon the part of Mauretania. King Bocchus was not unwill­ing to return to his old ambiguous position: without dis­solving his agreement with Jugurtha or dismissing him, he'entered into negotiations with the Roman general respectingthe terms of an alliance with Rome. When they wereagreed or seemed to be so, the king requested that, for thepurpose of concluding the treaty and receiving the royalcaptive, Marius would send to him Lucius Sulla, who wasknown and acceptable to the king partly from his havingformerly appeared as envoy of the senate at the Maure­tanian court, partly from the commendations of the Maure­tanian envoys destined for Rome to whom Sulla hadrendered services on their way.

the troops for Africa, showed very clearly what the Romanintentions were; the senate acted with fearful harshness,but it did not put on the semblance of concession. TheCarthaginians, however, would not open their eyes; there wasno statesman found, who had the power to move the unstablemultitude of the city either to thorough resistance or tothorough resignation. When they heard at the same time ofthe horrible decree of war and of the endurable demand forhostages, they complied immediately with the latter; andstill clung to hope, because they had not the courage fully torealize the import of surrendering themselves beforehand tothe arbitrary will of a mortal foe. The consuls sent thehostages from Lilybaeum to Rome, and informed the Cartha­ginian envoys that they would learn further particulars inAfrica. The landing was accomplished without resistance,and the provisions demanded were supplied. When theGerusia of Carthage appeared in a body at the head-quartersin Utica to receive the further orders, the consuls requiredin the first instance the disarming of the city. To the ques­tion of the Carthaginians, who was in that case to protectthem even against their own emigrants—against the army,which had swelled to 20,000 men, under the command ofHasdrubal who had saved himself from the sentence of deathby flight—it was replied, that this would be provided for bythe Romans. Accordingly the council of the city obsequi­ously appeared before the consuls with all their fleet-material,all the military stores of the public magazines, all the armsthat were found in the possession of private persons—to thenumber of 3000 catapults and 200,000 sets of armour—andinquired whether anything more was desired. Then the con­sul Lucius Marcius Censorinus rose and announced to thecouncil, that in accordance with the instructions given by thesenate the existing city was to be destroyed, but that theinhabitants were at liberty to settle anew wherever theychose in their territory, provided it were at a distance of atleast ten miles from the sea.
This fearful command aroused in the Phoenicians all the Resistance—shall we say magnanimous or frenzied ?—enthusiasm, which of the Car-was displayed previously by the Tyrians against Alexander, tnag1niaDS-and subsequently by the Jews against Vespasian.

In the Latin townKorba. of Norba for instance, when jEmilius Lepidus got into itby treason, the citizens killed each other and set fire them­selves to their town, solely in order to deprive their execu­tioners of vengeance and of booty. In Lower Italy Neapolishad already, been taken by assault, and Capua had, as itNola. would seem, been voluntarily surrendered; but Nola was
80. only evacuated by the Samnites in 674. On his flight fromNola the last surviving leader of note among the Italians,
90. the consul of the insurgents in the hopeful year 664, GainsPapius Mutilus, disowned by his wife to whom he hadstolen in disguise and with whom he had hoped to find anasylum, fell on his sword in Teanum before the door of hisown house. As to Samnium the dictator declared, thatRome would have no rest so long as Samnium existed, andthat the Samnite name ought therefore to be extirpatedfrom the earth; and, as he verified these words in terriblefashion on the prisoners taken before Rome and in Pravneste, so he appears to have also undertaken a raid for thepurpose of laying waste the country, to have captured
80. ^Esernia* (674?), and to have converted that hithertoflourishing and populous region into the desert which it hassince remained. In the same manner Tuder in Umbria wasstormed by Marcus Crassus. A longer resistance wasoffered in Etruria by Populonium and above all by theimpregnable Volaterrae, which gathered out of the remainsof the beaten party an army of four legions, and stood atwo years' siege conducted first by Sulla in person and thenby the former praetor Gaius Carbo, the brother of the demo­cratic consul, till at length in the third year after the battle

Mutilus ventured to attack the Roman camp; but he wasrepulsed, and the Samnites, who while retreating were as­sailed in the rear by the Roman cavalry, left nearly 6000dead on the field of battle. It was the first notable successwhich the Romans gained in this war; the army proclaimedthe general imperator, and the sadly fallen courage of thecapital began to revive. It is true that not long afterwardsthe victorious army was attacked in crossing a river by MariusEgnatius, and so emphatically defeated that it had to retreatas far as Teanum and to be reorganized there; but the exer­tions of the active consul succeeded in restoring his army to aserviceable condition even before the arrival of winter, and hereoccupied his old position under the walls of Acerrae, whichthe Samnite main army under Mutilus continued to besiege.
At the same time operations had also begun in Central CombatsItaly, where the revolt in the Abruzzi and the region of the with theFucine lake threatened the capital in dangerous proximity. Marwans.An independent corps under Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo wassent into Picenum in order that, resting for support onFirmum and Falerio, it might threaten Asculum; but themain body of the Roman northern army took its positionunder the consul Lupus on the borders of the Latin andMarsian territories, where the Valerian and Salarian high­ways brought the enemy nearest to the capital; the rivuletTolenus (Turano), which intersects the Valerian road be­tween Tibur and Alba and falls into the Velino at Rieti,separated the two armies. The consul Lupus impatientlypressed for a decision, and did not listen to the disagreeableadvice of Marius that he should exercise his men—unaccus­tomed to service—in the first instance in petty warfare. Atthe very commencement the division of Gaius Perpenna,10,000 strong, was totally defeated, whereupon the com­mander-in-chief deprived the defeated general of his com­mand and united the remnant of the corps with that whichwas under the orders of Marius, but did not allow himself tobe deterred from assuming the offensive and crossing theTolenus in two divisions, led partly by himself, partly byMarius, on two bridges constructed not far from each other.Publius Scato with the Marsians confronted them; he hadpitched his camp at the spot where Marius crossed thebrook, but, before the passage took place, he had withdrawnthence leaving behind the mere posts that guarded thecamp, and had taken a position in ambush further up the river.

Even for earlier injuries inflicted by the Populareson the aristocracy satisfaction was .now demanded, not with­out prospect of success, before the equestrian tribunals.Because Gaius Norbanus had eight years previously in con­cert with Saturninus driven the consular Quintus Caepiointo exile (P. 186) he was now (659) under his own law 95.accused of high treason, and the jurymen hesitated long—not whether the accused was guilty or innocent, butwhether his ally Saturninus or his enemy Caepio was tobe regarded as the more deserving of their hate—till at lastthey decided for acquittal. Even if people were not morefavourably disposed towards the government in itself thanbefore, yet, after having found themselves, although butfor a moment, on the verge of a real mob-rule, all menwho had anything to lose could not but look on the existinggovernment in a different light; it was notoriously wretchedand pernicious for the state, but the still more wretched andstill more pernicious government of the proletariate had con­ferred on it a relative value. The current now set so muchin that direction, that the multitude tore in pieces a tribuneof the people who had ventured to postpone the return ofQuintus Metellus, and that the democrats began to seektheir safety in league with murderers and poisoners—riddingthemselves, for example, of the hated Metellus by poison—oreven in league with the public enemy, several of them alreadytaking refuge at the court of king Mithradates who wassecretly preparing for war against Rome. External relationsalso assumed au aspect favourable for the government. TheRoman arms were employed but little in the period from theCimbrian to the Social war, but everywhere with honour.The only serious conflict was in Spain, where, during therecent years so trying for Rome (649 seq.), the Lusitanians 105.and Celtiberians had risen with unwonted vehemence againstthe Romans. In the years 656-661 the consul Titus Didius 98-93.in the northern and the consul Publius Crassus in thesouthern province not only re-established with valour andgood fortune the ascendancy of the Roman arms, but alsorazed the refractory towns and, where it seemed necessary,transplanted the population of the strong towns among themountains to the plains.

Cappadocia.Philopator (591-624) had, chiefly by the aid of the Attalids, 163-130.held his ground against his brother and rival Holopherneswho was supported by Syria—followed substantially thePergamene policy, both as respected absolute devotion toRome and the tendency to adopt Hellenic culture. Hewas the means of introducing that culture into the hithertoalmost barbarous Cappadocia, and along with it its extrava­gancies also, such as the worship of Bacchus and the dissolutepractices of the bands of wandering actors—the " artists " asthey were called. In reward for the fidelity to Rome whichhad cost this prince his life in the struggle with the Per­gamene pretender, his youthful heir Ariarathes VI. was notonly protected by the Romans against the usurpationattempted by the king of Pontus, but received also thesouth-eastern part of the kingdom of the Attalids, Lycaonia,along with the district bordering on it to the eastward andin earlier times included in Cilicia.
In the remote north-east of Asia Minor "Cappadocia on Pontus.the sea," or more briefly the "maritime state," Pontus,increased in extent and importance. Not long after thebattle of Magnesia king Pharnaces I. had extended hisdominion far beyond the Halys to Tius on the frontier ofBithynia, and in particular had possessed himself of therich Sinope, which was converted from a Greek free cityinto the residence of these kings. The neighbouring statesendangered by these encroachments, with king Eumenes II.at their head, had on that account waged war against him(571-575), and under Roman mediation had exacted from 133-179.him a promise to/evacuate Galatia and Paphlagonia; but thecourse of events shows that Pharnaces as well as his suc­cessor Mithradates V.

CHAPTER XIII.
LITERATURE AND ART.
The sixth century was, both in a political and a literary Literarypoint of view, a vigorous and great age. It is true that we reaction.do not find in the field of authorship any more than in thatof politics a man of the first rank; Naevius, Ennius, Plautus,Cato, gifted and lively authors of distinctly-marked indi­viduality, were not in the highest sense men of creativetalent; nevertheless we perceive in the soaring, stirring,bold strain of their dramatic, epic, and historic attempts.,that these are based on the gigantic struggles of the Punicwars. Much is only artificially transplanted, there arevarious faults in delineation and colouring, the form of artand the language are deficient in purity of treatment, Greekand national elements are quaintly conjoined; the wholeperformance betrays the stamp of its scholastic origin andwants independence and completeness; yet there exists inthe poets and authors of that age, if not the full power toreach their high aim, at any rate the courage to competewith and the hope of rivalling the Greeks. It is otherwisein the epoch before us. The morning mists fell; what hadbeen begun in the fresh feeling of the national strength hard­ened in war, with youthful want of insight into the difficultyof the undertaking and into the measure of their own talent,but also with youthful delight in and love to the work, couldnot be carried further now, when on the one hand the dullsultriness of the approaching revolutionary storm began tofill the air, and on the other hand the eyes of the moreintelligent were gradually opened to the incomparable gloryof Greek poetry and art and to the very moderate artistic

Asia Minor. It is significant of the greatness of the evil, thatan attempt of the government to check the worst iniquitiesof the slaveholders was. the immediate cause of the newinsurrection. That the free proletarians in Sicily werelittle better off than the slaves, had been shown by theirattitude in the first insurrection (P. 81); after it was sub­dued the Roman speculators took their revenge, and placednumbers of the free provincials among their slaves. In con­sequence of a sharp enactment issued against this by thesenate in 650, Publius Licinius Nerva, the governor of 104,Sicily at the time, appointed a court for deciding on claimsof freedom to sit in Syracuse. The court went earnestly towork ; in a short time decision was given in eight hundred pro­cesses against the slave-owners, and the number of causes independence was daily on the increase. The terrified plantershastened to Syracuse, to compel the Roman governor to isuspend such unparalleled administration of justice; Nervawas weak enough to let himself be terrified, and in harshlanguage informed the non-free persons requesting trial,that they should forego their troublesome demand for rightand justice and should instantly return to those who calledthemselves their masters. Those who were thus dismissed,instead of doing as he bade them, formed a conspiracy andwent to the mountains. The governor was not prepared formilitary measures, and even the wretched militia of theisland was not immediately at hand; so that he concludedan alliance with one of the best known captains of bandittiin the island, and induced him by the promise of personalpardon to betray the revolted slaves into the hands of theRomans. He thus gained the mastery over this band.But another band of runaway slaves succeeded in defeatinga division of the garrison of Enna (Castrogiovanni) ; and thisfirst success procured for the insurgents—what they espe­cially needed—arms and reinforcements. The armour oftheir fallen or fugitive opponents furnished the first basis oftheir military organization, and the number of the insur­gents soon swelled to many thousands. These Syrians in aforeign land already, like their predecessors, seemed tothemselves not unworthy to be governed by kings, as weretheir countrymen at home; and—parodying the trumperyking of their native land down to the very name—theyplaced the slave Salvius at their head as king Tryphon.In the district between Enna and Leoutini (Lentini) where

superseding the ordinary magistracy, and practically atleast administered their office as one which was unlimitedin point of time. Or, we should rather say, this newoffice, with its absolute power based on a decree of thepeople and restrained by no set term or colleague, was noother than the old monarchy, which in fact just rested onthe free engagement of the burgesses to obey one of theirnumber as absolute lord. It was argued even by contem­poraries in vindication of Sulla that a king is better than abad constitution,* and it may be presumed that the title ofdictator was only chosen to indicate that, as. the formerdictatorship implied a reassumption with various limita­tions (i. 263, 294, 321), so this new dictatorship involved acomplete reassumption, of the regal power. Thus, singularlyenough, Sulla's course here also coincided with that onwhich Gains Gracchus had entered with so wholly differenta design. In this respect too the conservative party had toborrow from its opponents; the protector of the oligarchicconstitution had himself to come forward as a tyrant, inorder to avert the ever-impending tyrannis. There was nolittle of defeat in this last victory of the oligarchy.Executions. Sulla had not sought and had not desired the difficult anddreadful labour of the work of restoration ; but, as no othercourse was left to him but either to leave it in utterly in­capable hands or to undertake it himself, he set himself toit with remorseless energy. First of all a settlement had tobe effected in respect to the guilty. Sulla was in himselfinclined to pardon. Sanguine as he was in temperament, hemight occasionally give vent to violent rage, and well mightthose beware who saw his eye gleam and his cheek colour;but the chronic vindictiveness, which characterized Mariusin the irritability of his old age, was altogether foreign toSulla's easy disposition. Not only had he borne himselfwith comparatively great moderation after the revolution of88. 666 (P. 268); even the second revolution, which had perpetrated so fearful outrages and had affected him in personso severely, had not disturbed his equilibrium. At the sametime that the executioner was dragging the bodies of hisfriends through the streets of the capital, he had sought tosave the life of the blood-stained Fimbria, and, when thelatter died by his own hand, had given orders for his decent

But the poor and butsuperficially subdued country was not sufficiently importantto be erected into a distinct province: the Romans con­tented themselves, as they had already done in the case ofthe more important possessions in Epirus, with having itadministered from Italy along with Cisalpine Gaul; anarrangement which was, at least as a rule, retained evenwhen the province of Macedonia had been erected in 608 146.and its north-western frontier had been fixed to the north­ward of Scodra.*

He himself advanced from Occupationdifferent sides upon the capital, which as well as the whole of Rome.surrounding district he found abandoned by the enemyand occupied without resistance. He barely took time tocompose the minds of the people by an address and to makethe most necessary arrangements, and immediately passedon to Etruria, that in concert with Metellus he might dis­lodge his antagonists from Northern Italy.
Metellus had meanwhile encountered and defeated Carbo's Metelluslieutenant Carrinas at the river jEsis (Esino between againstAncona and Sinigaglia), which separated the district of^arb?mPicenum from the Gallic province; when Carbo in person )^[vcame up with his superior army, Metellus had been obligedto abstain from any further advance. But on the news ofthe battle at Sacriportus, Carbo, anxious about his commu­nications, had retreated to the Flaminian road, with a viewto take up his headquarters at its rallying point Ariminum,and from that point to hold the passes of the Apennines onone hand and the valley of the Po on the other. In thisretrograde movement different divisions fell into the handsof the enemy, and not only so, but Sena Gallica was stormedand Carbo's rearguard broken in a brilliant cavalry engage- Carboment by Pompeius; nevertheless Carbo attained on the assailed onwhole his object. The consular Norbanus took the com- 'rj? sld.esmand in the valley of the Po; Carbo himself proceeded toEtruria. But the march of Sulla with his victorious legionsto Etruria altered the position of affairs; soon three Sullanarmies from Gaul, Umbria, and Rome established commu­nications with each other. Metellus with the fleet wentpast Ariminum to Ravenna, and at Faventia cut off thecommunication between Ariminum and the valley of thePo, into which he sent forward a division along the greatroad to Placentia under Marcus Lucullus, the quaestor ofSulla and brother of his admiral in the Mithradatic war.The young Pompeius and his contemporary and rivalCrassus penetrated from Picenum by mountain-paths intoUmbria and gained the Flaminian road at Spoletium, wherethey defeated Carbo's legate Carrinas and shut him up inthe town; he succeeded, however, in escaping from it on a

purely aristocratic blood was in general of no use, andthat Sulla clearly discerned its uselessness, is shown by thefact that, with the exception of Quintus Metellus who wasrelated to him by marriage, he selected all his instrumentsout of what was previously the middle party and the desertersfrom the democratic camp—such as Lucius Flaccus, LuciusPhilippus, Quintus Ofella, Gnaeus Pompeius. Sulla was asmuch in earnest about the restoration of the old constitu­tion as the most vehement aristocratic emigrant; he under­stood however, not perhaps to the full extent—for how inthat case could he have put hand to the work at all ?—butbetter at any rate than his party, the enormous difficultieswhich attended this work of restoration. Comprehensiveconcessions so far as concession was possible without affect­ing the essence of oligarchy, and the establishment of anenergetic system of repression and prevention, were both inhis view unavoidable; and he saw clearly that the senate asit stood would refuse or mutilate every concession, and wouldparliamentarily ruin every systematic reconstruction. IfSulla had already after the Sulpician revolution carried outwhat he deemed necessary in both respects without askingmuch of their advice, he was now determined, under circum­stances of far more severe and intense excitement, to restorethe oligarchy—not with the aid, but in spite, of the oligarchs—by his own hand.Sulla regent Sulla, however, was not now consul as he had been then,of Rome- but was furnished merely with proconsular, that is to say,purely military power; he needed an authority, preservingwith all possible strictness constitutional forms, but yetextraordinary, in order to impose his reform on friends andfoes. In a letter to the senate he announced to them thatit seemed to him indispensable that they should place theregulation of the state in the hands of a single manequipped with unlimited plenitude of power, and that bedeemed himself qualified to fulfil this difficult task. Thisproposal, disagreeable as it was to many, was under theexisting circumstances a command. By direction of thesenate its chief, the interrex Lucius Valerius Flaccus thefather, as interim holder of the supreme power submitted tothe burgesses the proposal, that the proconsul Lucius Cor­nelius Sulla should now receive a retrospective approvalof all his official acts as consul and proconsul, and shouldbe empowered in future to adjudicate without appeal on

as the " Istrian War " of Hostius and the " Annals (perhaps)of the Gallic War " by Aulus Furius (about 650), which to allappearance took up the narrative at the very point whereEnnius had broken off—the description of the Istrian warof 576 and 577. In didactic and elegiac poetry no promi­nent name appears. The only successes, which the recita­tive poetry of this period has to show, belong to the domainof what was called Saturn—a species of art, which like theletter or the pamphlet allowed any form and admitted anysort of contents, and accordingly in default of all propergeneric characters drew its individual shape wholly from theindividuality of each poet, and occupied a position not merelyon the boundary between poetry .and prose, but even morethan half beyond the bounds of literature proper. Thehumorous poetical epistles, which one of the younger menof the Scipionic circle, Spurius Mummius, the brother of thedestroyer of Corinth, sent home from the camp of Corinthto his friends, were still read with pleasure a century after­wards; and numerous poetical pleasantries of that sort notdestined for publication probably proceeded at that timefrom the rich social and intellectual life of the better circlesof Rome.
Its representative in literature is Gaius Lucilius (606-651)sprung of a respectable family in the Latin colony of Suessa,and likewise a member of the Scipionic circle. His poemsare, as it were, open letters to the public. Their contents, asa gifted successor gracefully says, embrace the whole life ofa cultivated man of independence, who looks upon theevents passing on the political stage from the pit and occa­sionally from the side-scenes; who converses with the bestof his epoch as his equals; who prosecutes literature andscience with sympathy and intelligence without wishing per­sonally to pass for a poet or scholar ; and who, in fine, makeshis pocket-book the confidential receptacle for everythinggood and bad that he meets with, for his political experiencesand expectations, for grammatical remarks and criticisms onart, for the incidents of his own life, visits, dinners, journeys,as well as for the anecdotes which he has heard. Caustic,capricious, thoroughly individual, the Lucilian poetry hasyet a distinctly impressed controversial and, so far, didacticaim in literature as well as in morals and politics; there isin it something of the protest of the country against thecapital; the Suessan's sense of his own purity of speech and

Roman augurs grown into a prolix system of various celestialomens and rules of conduct associated therewith; in theearlier portion of this period it was even directly enactedby the iElian and Fufian law, that every popular assemblyshould be compelled to disperse if it should occur to anyof the higher magistrates to look for signs of a thunder­storm in the sky; and the Roman oligarchy was proud ofthe cunning device which enabled them thenceforth by asingle pious fraud to impress the stamp of invalidity onany decree of the people. Conversely the Eoman oppositionrebelled against the ancient practice under which the fourprincipal colleges of priests tilled up their own ranks whenvacancies arose, and demanded the extension of popularelection to the stalls themselves, as it had been previouslyintroduced with reference to the presidents of these colleges(ii. 357). This was certainly inconsistent with the spiritof these corporations; but they had no right to complain ofit, after they had become themselves untrue to their spirit,and had played into the hands of the Government at itsrequest by furnishing religious pretexts for the annullingof political proceedings. This affair became an apple ofcontention between the parties: the senate beat off thefirst attack in 609, on which occasion the Scipionic circle i4.-,.especially turned the scale for the rejection of the proposal;on the other hand the project passed in 650 with the proviso 104.already made in reference to the election of the presidentsfor the benefit of scrupulous consciences, that not thewhole burgesses but only the lesser half of the tribesshould make the election (P. 204) ; finally Sulla restoredthe right of co-optation in its full extent (P. 362). "Withthis care on the part of the conservatives for the purenational religion it was of course quite compatible, thattheir very noblest circles should openly make a jest ofit. The practical side of the Roman priesthood was thepriestly cuisine; the augural and pontifical banquets wereas it were the official gala-days in the life of a Eomanepicure, and several of them formed epochs in the historyof gastronomy; the banquet on the accession of the augurQuintus Hortensius for instance brought roast peacocksinto vogue.

So completely had thestate of affairs changed in Picenum, that the Italians nowfound themselves confined to Asculum as the Romans werepreviously to Firmum, and the war was thus once more con­verted into a siege.
Lastly, there was added in the course of the year to the Umbro-two difficult and straggling wars in southern and central EtruscanItaly a third in the north. The state of matters apparently con"lcti-so dangerous for Rome after the first months of the warhad induced a great portion of the Umbrian, and isolatedEtruscan, communities to declare for the insurrection; sothat it became necessary to despatch against the UmbriansAulus Plotius, and against the Etruscans Lucius PorciusCato. Here however the Romans encountered a far lessenergetic resistance than in the Marsian and Samnite coun­tries, and maintained a most decided superiority in the field.

Every one felt that,though able generals might still once and again avert imme­diate destruction, the commonwealth was only the moresurely on the way to ruin under the government of the re­stored oligarchy; but every one felt also that the time waspast when in such cases the burgess-body provided its ownredress, and that there was no amendment so long as theplace of Gaius Gracchus remained empty. How deeply themultitude felt the blank that was left after the disappearanceof those two illustrious youths who had opened the gates torevolution, and how childishly in fact it grasped at anyshadow of a substitute, was shown by the case of the pretendedson of Tiberius Gracchus, who, although the very sister ofthe two Gracchi charged him with fraud in the open Forum,99. was yet chosen by the people in 655 as tribune solely onaccount of his usurped name. In the same spirit the mul­titude exulted in the presence of Gaius Marius; how shouldit not? He, if any one, seemed the proper man—he was atany rate the first general and the most popular name of histime, confessedly brave and upright, and recommended as re­generator of the state by his very position aloof from thestruggles of party—how should not the people, how shouldnot he himself, have deemed that he was so! Public opinionas decidedly as possible favoured the opposition.

time an attack was directed from Macedonia against theScordisci, who had, it may be presumed, made common causewith the assailed inhabitants of the coast. Soon afterwards(625) the consul Tuditanus in connection with the able 129.Decimus Brutus, the conqueror of the Spanish Gallaeci,humbled the Japydes, and, after sustaining a defeat atthe outset, at length carried the Roman arms into the heartof Dalmatia as far as the river Kerka, 115 miles distant fromAquileia; the Japydes thenceforth appear as a nation atpeace and on friendly terms with Rome. But ten yearslater (635) the Dalmatians rose afresh, once more in concert 119.with the Scordisci. While the consul Lucius Cotta foughtagainst the latter and in doing so advanced apparently asfar as Segestica, his colleague Lucius Metellus afterwardsnamed Dalmaticus, the elder brother of the conqueror ofNumidia, marched against the Dalmatians, conquered themand passed the winter in Salona (Spalato), which town hence­forth appears as the chief stronghold of the Romans in thatregion.' It is not improbable that the construction of theVia Gabijiia, which led from Salona in an easterly directionto Andetrium (Clissa) and thence farther into the interior,falls within this period.
The expedition of the consul of 639, Marcus ^Emilius The [115.Scaurus, against the Taurisci* presented more the character Komansof a war of conquest. He was the first of the Romans to cross cross tnethe chain of the eastern Alps at their lowest elevation be- A)tween Trieste and Laybach, and contracted hospitable rela­tions with the Taurisci; which secured a not unimportantcommercial intercourse without involving the Romans, as aformal subjugation would have involved them, in the com­motions of the peoples to the north of the Alps. The at­tacks about the same time directed from Macedonia towardsthe Danube yielded at first a very unfavourable result: theconsul of 640, Gaius Porcius Cato, was surprised in the 114.Servian mountains by the Scordisci, and his army completelydestroyed, while he himself, with a few attendants, disgrace­fully fled. With difficulty the praetor Marcus Didius pro­tected the Roman frontier.

Still more important than these individual accessions wasthe gain of the district of Picenum, which was substantiallydue to the son of Strabo, the young Gnaeus Pompeius.The latter, like his father originally no adherent of theoligarchy, had acknowledged the revolutionary governmentand even taken service in Cinna's army; but in his casethe fact was not forgotten, that his father had borne armsagainst the revolution; he found himself assailed in variousforms and even threatened with the loss of his very con­siderable wealth by an indictment charging him to give upthe booty which was, or was alleged to have been, embezzledby his father after the capture of Asculum. The protectionin particular of the consul Carbo who was personally attachedto him, along with the eloquence of the consular LuciusPhilippus and of the young Lucius Hortensius,' avertedfrom him financial ruin; but he remained uneasy. On thenews of Sulla's landing he went to Picenum, where he hadextensive possessions and the best municipal connectionsderived from his father and the Social war, and set up thestandard of the Optimate party in Auximum (Osimo). Thedistrict, which was mostly inhabited by old burgesses, joinedhim; the young men, many of whom had served with himunder his father, readily ranged themselves under the cou­rageous leader who, not yet twenty-three years of age, wasas much soldier as general, sprang to the front of his cavalryin combat, and vigorously assailed the enemy along with them.The corps of Picenian volunteers soon grew to three legions;divisions under Cloelius, Gaius Albius Carrinas, LuciusJunius Brutus Damasippus,* were despatched from thecapital to put down the Picenian insurrection, but the ex­temporized general, dexterously taking advantage of the dis­sensions that arose among them, had the skill to evade themor to beat them in detail and to effect his junction with themain army of Sulla, apparently in Apulia.

While a gold mine was thus opened for the mercantileclass, and the members of the new partnership constituted agreat financial power imposing even for the government—a"senate of merchants "—a definite sphere of public actionwas at the same time assigned to them in the jurycourts. The field of the criminal procedure which by rightfell to be brought before the burgesses was among theRomans from the first very narrow, and was, as we alreadyobserved (P.l 12), still further narrowed by Gracchus. Mostprocesses—both such as related to public crimes, and civilcauses—were decided either by single jurymen (judices),or by commissions partly permanent, partly extraordinary.Hitherto both the former and the latter had been exclusivelytaken from the senate; Gracchus transferred the functions ofjurymen—both in strictly civil processes, and in the case ofthe standing and temporary commissions—to the equestrianorder, directing a new list of jurymen to be annually formedafter the analogy of the equestrian centuries from all personsof equestrian rating, and excluding the senators directly, andthe young men of senatorial families by the fixing of acertain limit of age, from judicial functions.* It is notimprobable that the selection of jurymen was chieflymade to fall on the same men who played the leading partin the great mercantile associations, particularly those farm­ing the revenues in Asia and elsewhere, just because thesehad a very close personal interest in sitting in the courts;and, if the lists of judices and the societies of publkani thuscoincided as regards their chiefs, we can all the better under­stand the significance of the counter-senate thus constituted.The substantial effect of this was, that, while hitherto therehad been only two authorities in the state—the government asthe administering and controlling, and the burgesses as the

energy the distribution of the domains which he had carried—so sad was the state of things in Rome, that honest patriotswere forced into the horrible hypocrisy of abandoning thecriminal and yet appropriating the fruit of his crime. Forthat reason too the opponents of Gracchus were in a certainsense not wrong, when they accused him of aspiring to thecrown. It was a fresh ground of charge against him ratherthan a justification, that he himself was probably a strangerto any such thought. The aristocratic government wasso thoroughly pernicious, that a citizen who was able todepose the senate and to put himself in its room wouldperhaps have benefited the commonwealth more than heinjured it.Results, But such a bold player Tiberius Gracchus was not. He
was a tolerably able, thoroughly well-meaning, conservativepatriot, who simply did not know what he was doing; whoin the fullest belief that he was calling the people evokedthe rabble, and grasped at the crown without being himselfaware of it, till the inexorable concatenation of eventsurged him irresistibly into the career of the demagogue-tyrant. Then the family commission, the interferences withthe public finances, the further "reforms" exacted byperplexity and despair, the body-guard taken from thepavement, and the conflicts in the streets displayed the me­lancholy usurper more and more clearly to himself andothers; and at length the unchained spirits of revolutionseized and devoured their incapable conjurer. The infamousbutchery, through which he perished, condemns itself, as itcondemns the aristocratic faction whence it issued; but theglory of martyrdom, with which it has embellished the nameof Tiberius Gracchus, came in this instance, as usually, tothe wrong man. The best of his contemporaries judgedotherwise. When the catastrophe was mentioned to Scipio-32milianus, he uttered the words of Homer:

marched into the region of Cirta, where Metellus was in

that in the person of Jugurtha he held in his hands the real
prize of the struggle for Rome. But what were his intentions
—whether to sell his son-in-law dear to the Romans, or to
take up the national war in concert with that son-in-law—

assumed the supreme command for the next campaign in

He was indebted for it in some degree to a revolution.Relying on the services which he had rendered and at thesame time on oracles which had been communicated to him,he had resolved to come forward as a candidate for theconsulship. If the aristocracy had supported the constitu­tional, and in other respects quite justifiable, candidature ofthis able man, who was not at all inclined to take part withthe opposition, nothing would have come of the matter butthe enrolment of a new family in the consular Fasti. In­stead of this the man of non-noble birth, who aspired to thehighest public dignity, was reviled by the whole governingcaste as a daring innovator and revolutionist; just as theplebeian candidate had been formerly treated by the patri­cians, but now without any such formal ground as there wasthen in law. The brave officer was sneered at in sharplanguage by Metellus—Marius was told that he might waitwith his candidature till Metellus' son, a beardless boy,could be his colleague—and he was with the worst gracesuffered to leave almost at the last moment, that he mightappear in the capital as a candidate for the consulship of

faded far earlier than the Italian, had long ago passedthe epoch of faith and thenceforth moved exclusively in thesphere of speculation and reflection; for long there had beenno religion there, and nothing but philosophy. But eventhe philosophic activity of the Hellenic mind had, when itbegan to exert influence on Rome, already left the epoch ofproductive speculation far behind it, and had arrived at thestage at which there is not only no origination of reallynew systems, but even the power of apprehending the moreperfect of the older systems begins to wane and men restrictthemselves to the repetition, soon passing into the scholastictradition, of the less complete dogmas of their predecessors;at that stage, accordingly, when philosophy, instead of givinggreater depth and freedom to the mind, rather renders itshallow and imposes on it the worst of all chains—chains ofits own forging. The enchanted draught of speculation, al­ways dangerous, is, when diluted and stale, certain poison.The contemporary Greeks presented it thus flat and di­luted to the Romans, and these had not the judgment either'to refuse it or to go back from the livingschoolmasters to thedead masters. Plato and Aristotle, to say nothing of thesages before Socrates, remained without material influenceon the Roman culture, although their illustrious names werefreely employed, and their more easily understood writingswere probably read and translated. Accordingly theRomans became in philosophy simply inferior scholars ofbad teachers. Besides the historico-rationalistic view ofreligion, which resolved the myths into biographies of variousbenefactors of the human race living in the grey dawnof early times whom superstition had transformed intogods, or Euhemerism as it was called (ii. 401), there werechiefly three philosophical schools that came to be of im­portance for Italy ; viz. the two dogmatic schools of Epicurus(+484) and Zeno (+491) and the sceptical school of Arcesi- 270. 263.laus ( + 513) and Carneades (541-625), or, to use the school- 241.names, Epicureanism, the Stoa, and the newer Academy. 213-129.The last of these schools, which started from the impossibi­lity of assured knowledge and in its stead only conceded aspossible a provisional opinion sufficient for practical require­ments, presented mainly a polemical aspect, seeing that itcaught every proposition of positive faith or of philosophicdogmatism in the meshes of its dilemmas.

It was not until the present period that theAtellan piece was handed over to actors properly so called,*and was employed, like the Greek satyric drama, as anafterpiece particularly after tragedies; a change which na­turally suggested the extension of literary activity to thatfield. Whether this authorship developed itself altogetherindependently, or whether possibly the art-farce of LowerItaly, in various respects of kindred character, gave theimpulse to this Roman farce,\ can no longer be determined;that the several pieces were uniformly original works, iscertain. The founder of this new species of literature,Lucius Pomponius from the Latin colony of Bononia, ap­peared in the first half of the seventh century ;J and alongwith his pieces those of another poet Novius soon becamefavourites. So far as the few remains and the reports ofthe old litteratores allow us to form an opinion, they wereshort farces, ordinarily perhaps of one act, the charm of whichdepended less on the preposterous and loosely constructedplot than on the drastic portraiture of particular classesand situations. Festal days and public acts were favouritesubjects of comic delineation, such as the "Marriage,"the "First of March," "Harlequin Candidate;" so were


* In the time of the Empire the Atellana was represented by professionalactors (Friedlander in Becker's Handbuch, iv. 546). The time at which thesebegan to engage in it is not reported, but it can hardly have been other thanthe time at which the Atellan was admitted among the regular stage-plays, i.e.,the epoch before Cicero (Oic. ad Fam. ix. 16). This view is not inconsistentwith the circumstance that still in Livy's time (vii. 2) the Atellan playersretained their honorary rights as contrasted with other actors; for the state­ment that professional actors began to take part in performing the Atellana forpay does not imply that the Atellana was no longer performed, in the countrytowns for instance, by unpaid amateurs, and the privilege therefore still re­mained applicable.
t It deserves attention that the Greek farce was not only especially at homein Lower Italy, but that several of its pieces (e.g., among those of Sopater,the " Lentile-Porridge," the "Wooers of Bacchis," the " Valet of Mystakos,"the " Bookworms,'' the " Physiologist") strikingly remind us of the Ateilanae.This composition of farces must have reached down to the time at which theGreeks in and around Neapolis formed a distinct enclosure within the Latin-speaking Campania; for one of these writers of farces, BLtsus of Capreae, bearseven a Roman name and wrote a farce "Saturnus."90. + According to Eusebius, Pomponius flourished about 664; Velleius calls

alone, having estate of 100,000 sesterces (£1050) or up­wards, possessed almost half of the votes. Practically therewas thus introduced for the election of consuls, praetors,and censors, a census which really excluded the non-wealthyfrom exercising the suffrage. The legislative initiative inthe case of the tribunes of the people was restricted by therule, that every proposal had henceforth to be submitted bythem in the first instance to the senate and could only comebefore the people in the event of the senate approving it.
These enactments which were called forth by the Sul-pician attempt at revolution from the man who then cameforward as the shield and sword of the constitutional party—the consul Sulla—bear an altogether peculiar character.Sulla ventured, without consulting the burgesses or jury­men, to pronounce sentence of death on twelve of the mostdistinguished men including magistrates actually in officeand the most famous general of his time, and publicly to de­fend these proscriptions; a violation of the venerable andsacred laws of appeal, which met with severe censure evenfrom very conservative men, such as Quintus Scaevola. Heventured to overthrow an arrangement as to the electionswhich had subsisted for a century and a half, and to restore theelectoral census which had been long obsolete and proscribed.He ventured practically to withdraw the right of legislationfrom its two primitive factors, the magistrates and the co-mitia, and to transfer it to a board which had at no time pos­sessed formally any other privilege in this respect than thatof being asked for its advice (i. 326). Hardly had any demo­crat ever exercised justice in forms so tyrannical, or dis­turbed and remodelled the foundations of the constitutionwith so reckless an audacity, as this conservative reformer.But if we look at the substance instead of the form, wereach very different conclusions. Revolutions have nowhereended, and least of all in Rome, without demanding a certainnumber of victims, who under forms more or less bor­rowed from justice atone for the fault of defeat as thoughit were a crime. Any one who recalls the succession ofprosecutions carried on by the victorious partv after thefall of the Gracchi and Saturninus (P. 95,129, 216.) will beinclined to yield to the victor of the Esquiline market thepraise of candour and comparative moderation, in so far as,first, he without ceremony accepted as war what was reallysuch and proscribed the men who were defeated as enemies

tresa assumes towards the spies of the army advancing to be­siege it, and as early as 593 dismissed the Greek philosophers igi.along with the rhetoricians from Rome.. In fact the veryfirst debut of philosophy on a great scale in Rome was aformal declaration of war against faith and morals. It wasoccasioned by the occupation of Oropus by the Athenians,a step which they commissioned three of the most esteemedprofessors of philosophy, including Carneades the master ofthe modern sophistical school, to justify before the senate(599). The selection was so far appropriate, as the utterly 153.scandalous transaction defied any justification in commonsense; whereas it was quite in keeping with the circum­stances of the case, when Carneades proved by thesis andcounter-thesis that exactly as many and as cogent reasonsmight be adduced in praise of injustice as in praise ofjustice, and when he showed in due logical form thatwith equal propriety the Athenians might be required tosurrender Oropus and the Romans to confine themselvesonce more to their old straw huts on the Palatine. Theyoung men who were masters of the Greek language wereattracted in crowds by the scandal as well as by the livelyand emphatic delivery of the celebrated man; but on thisoccasion at least Cato could not be found fault with, whenhe not only bluntly enough compared the dialectic argu­ments of the philosophers to the tedious dirges of the wail-ing-women, but also insisted on the senate dismissing aman who understood the art of making right wrong andwrong right, and whose defence was in fact nothing but ashameless and almost insulting confession of injustice. Butsuch dismissals had no great effect, more especially as theRoman youth could not be prevented from hearing philo­sophic discourses at Rhodes and Athens. Men became ac­customed first to tolerate philosophy at least as a necessaryevil, and ere long to seek for the Roman religion, which wasno longer tenable in its simplicity, a support in foreign phi­losophy—a support which no doubt ruined it as faith, but inreturn at any rate allowed the man of culture decorously toretain in some measure the names and forms of the popularcreed. But this support could neither be Euhemerism, northe system of Carneades or of Epicurus.

Without neglectingtheir national education, so far as there was such, he madeprovision like the Greeks for the physical development ofhis boys, not indeed by gympastic exercises which wereaccording to Roman notions' inadmissible, but by instruc­tion in the chase which was among the Greeks developedalmost like an art; and he elevated their Greek instructionin such a way, that the language was no longer merelylearned and practised for the sake of speaking, but after theGreek fashion the whole subject-matter of general higherculture was associated with the language and developedout of it — embracing first of all the knowledge of Greekliterature with the mythological and historical informationnecessary for understanding it, and then rhetoric and phi­losophy. The library of king Perseus was the only portionof the Macedonian spoil that Paullus took for himself, withthe view of presenting it to his sons. Even Greek paintersand sculptors were found in his train and completedthe aesthetic training of his children. That the time waspast, when men could in this field preserve a merelynegative attitude as regarded Hellenism, had been felteven by Cato; the better classes had probably now a pre­sentiment, that the noble substance of Roman character wasless endangered by Hellenism as a whole than by Hellenismmutilated and misshapen: the mass of the upper society ofRome and Italy went along with the new mode. Therehad been for long no want of Greek schoolmasters in Rome;now they arrived in troops—and as teachers not merely ofthe language but of literature and culture in general—at thenewly-opened lucrative market for the sale of their wisdom.Greek tutors and teachers of philosophy, who, even if theywere not slaves, were as a rule accounted as servants,* werenow permanent inmates in the palaces of Rome; peoplespeculated in them, and there is a statement that 200,000sesterces (£2000) were paid for a Greek literary slave1 61. of the first rank.

disembarked in the morning and to have been all soldbefore evening—a proof at once how enormous was thenumber of slaves delivered, and how, notwithstanding, thedemand still exceeded the supply. It was no wonder.Already in describing the Roman economy of the sixth cen­tury we have explained that it was based, like all the greatdealings of antiquity generally, on the employment of slaves(ii. 360 et seq. 380). In whatever direction speculationapplied itself, its instrument was invariably man reduced inthe eye of the law to a brute. Trades were in great partcarried on by slaves, so that the proceeds belonged to themaster. The levying of the public revenues in the lowerdepartments was regularly conducted by the slaves of theassociations that leased them. Servile hands performedthe operations of mining, making pitch, and others of asimilar kind; it became early the custom to send herds ofslaves to the Spanish mines, whose superintendents rea­dily received them and paid a high rent for them. Thetending of cattle was universally performed by slaves. Wehave already mentioned the armed, and frequently mounted,slave-herdsmen in the great pastoral districts of Italy (ii.371); and the same sort of pastoral husbandry soon becamein the provinces also a favourite object of Roman specula­tion—Dalmatia, for instance, was hardly acquired (599) 155.when the Roman capitalists began to prosecute the rearingof cattle there on a great scale after the Italian fashion.But far worse in every respect was the plantation systemproper—the cultivation of the fields by a band of slaves notunfrequently branded with iron, who with shackles on theirlegs performed the labours of the field under overseersduring the day, and were locked up together by night inthe common, frequently subterranean, labourers' prison.This plantation system had migrated from the East to Car­thage (ii. 9), and seems to have been brought by the Car­thaginians to Sicily, where, probably for this reason, it ap­pears developed earlier and more fully than in any otherpart of the Roman dominions.* "We find the territory ofLeontini, about 30,000 jujera of arable land, which was leton lease as Roman domain (ii. 149) by the censors, divided

was deposited in front of it; the senate, as if surprised,appeared en masse at the door in order to view the deadbody, and then retired to determine what should be done.The leaders of the democracy had gone from the Capitol totheir houses; Marcus Flaccus had spent the night in pre­paring for the war in the streets, while Gracchus apparentlydisdained to strive with destiny. Next morning, whenthey learned the preparations made by their opponents atthe Capitol and the Forum, both proceeded to the Aventine,the old stronghold of the popular party in the strugglesbetween the patricians and the plebeians. Gracchus wentthither silent and unarmed; Flaccus called the slaves toarms and entrenched himself in the temple of Diana, whilehe at the same time sent his younger son Quintus to theenemy's camp, in order if possible to arrange a compromise.The latter returned with the announcement that the aris­tocracy demanded unconditional surrender; at the sametime he brought a summons from the senate to Gracchusand Flaccus to appear before it and to answer for theirviolation of the majesty of the tribunes. Gracchus wishedto comply with the summons, but Flaccus prevented himfrom doing so, and repeated the equally weak and mistakenattempt to move such antagonists to a compromise. Wheninstead of the two cited leaders the young Quintus Flaccusonce more presented himself alone, the consul treated theirrefusal to appear as the beginning of open insurrectionagainst the government; he ordered the messenger to bearrested and gave the signal for attack on the Aventine,while at the same time he caused proclamation to be madein the streets that the government would give to whosoevershould bring the head of Gracchus or of Flaccus its literalweight in gold, and that they would guarantee complete in­demnity to every one who should leave the Aventine beforethe beginning of the conflict. The? ranks on the Aventinespeedily thinned; the valiant nobility in union with theCretans and the slaves stormed the almost undefendedmount and killed all whom they found, about 250 persons,mostly of humble rank. Marcus Flaccus fled with his eldestson to a place of concealment, where they were soon after­wards hunted out and put to death.

position. His declining the suggestion would probably leadto a breach; his accepting it would throw his most aristo­cratic and bravest officer iuto the hands of a man more thanuntrustworthy, who, as every one knew, played a doublegame with the Bomaus and with Jugurtha, and who seemedalmost to have contrived" the scheme for the purpose of ob­taining for himself provisional hostages from both sides inthe persons of Jugurtha and Sulla. But the wish to termi­nate the war outweighed every other consideration, andSulla agreed to undertake the perilous task which Mariussuggested to him. He boldly departed under the guidanceof Volux the son of king Bocchus, nor did his resolutionwaver even when his guide led him through the midst of Ju-gurtha's camp. He rejected the pusillanimous proposals offlight that came from his attendants, and marched, with theking's son at his side, uninjured through the enemy. Thedaring officer evinced the same decision in the discussionswith the sultan, and induced him at length seriously to makehis choice.
Jugurtha was sacrificed. Under the pretext that all his sarremkrrequests were to be granted, he was allured by his own and execu-father-in-law into an ambush, his attendants were killed, tl°"°t''"'and he himself was taken prisoner. The great traitor thus gurfell by the treachery of his nearest relatives. Lucius Sullabrought the crafty and restless African in chains along withhis children to the Roman headquarters; and the war whichhad lasted for seven years was at an end. The victory wasprimarily associated with the name of Marius. King Ju­gurtha in royal robes and in chains, along with his two sons,preceded the triumphal chariot of the victor, when heentered Eome on the 1st of January 650: by his orders the 10i.son of the desert perished a few days afterwards in the sub­terranean city-prison, the old tullianum at the Capitol—the"bath of ice," as the African called it when he crossed thethreshold in order either to be strangled or to perish fromcold and hunger there. But it could not be denied, thatMarius had the least important share in the actual suc­cesses: the conquest of Numidia up to the edge of thedesert was the work of Metellus, the capture of Jugurthawas the work of Sulla, and between tha two Marius playeda part somewhat compromising the dignity of an ambitiousupstart. Marius reluctantly tolerated the assumption byhis predecessor of the name of conqueror of Numidia; he

against reform, but turned away with horror from such con­federates, and ordered his four sons to carry the bier of hisgreat antagonist to the funeral pile. The funeral was hurriedover; with veiled head the last of the family of the con­queror of Zama was borne forth, without any one havingbeen previously allowed to see the face of the deceased, andthe flames of the funeral pile consumed the remains of theillustrious hero and with them the traces of the crime.
The history of Rome presents various men of greatergenius than Scipio jEmilianus, but none equalling him inmoral purity, in the utter absence of political selfishness, ingenerous love of his country, and none, perhaps, to whom des­tiny has assigned a more tragic part. Conscious of the bestintentions and of no common abilities, he was doomed tosee the ruin of his country carried out before his eyes, andto repress within him every serious attempt to save it,because he clearly perceived that he should only therebyaggravate the evil; doomed to the necessity of sanctioningoutrages like that of Nasica, and at the same time ofdefending the work of the victim against his murderers.Tet he might say that he had not lived in vain. It was tohim, at least quite as much as to the author of the Sempro-nian law, that the Roman burgess-body was indebted for anincrease of nearly 80,000 new farm allotments ; he it was too,who put a stop to that distribution of the domains when ithad produced such benefit as it could produce. That it wastime to leave it off, was no doubt disputed at the moment evenby well-meaning men; but the fact that Gaius Gracchus didnot seriously recur to those possessions which might have beenand yet were not distributed under the law of his brother,tells very strongly in favour of the belief that Scipio hit sub­stantially the right moment. Both measures were extortedfrom the parties—the first from the aristocracy, the secondfrom the friends of reform; the latter its author paid forwith his life. It was his lot to fight for his country onmany a battle-field and to return home uninjured, thathe might perish there by the hand of an assassin; but inhis quiet chamber he no less died for Rome than if he hadfallen beneath the walls of Carthage.

which has reached almost to our own times. But in inter­nal development also this epoch bears the same character.The old organization collapses irretrievably. The Romancommonwealth was planned as a civic community, whichthrough its free burgess-body gave to itself rulers and laws;which was governed by these duly advised rulers withinthese legal limits with kingly freedom; and around whichthe Italian confederacy, as an aggregate of free civic com­munities essentially homogeneous and cognate with theRoman, and the body of extra-Italian allies, as an aggregateof Greek free cities and barbaric peoples and principalities—both more superintended, than domineered over, by thecommunity of Rome—formed a double circle. It was thefinal result of the revolution—and both parties, the nomi­nally conservative as well as the democratic party, had co­operated towards it and concurred in it—that of thisvenerable structure, which at the beginning of the presentepoch, though full of chinks and tottering, still stood erect,not one stone was at its close left upon another. Theholder of sovereign power was now either a single man or aclose oligarchy at one time of those who were noble, at an­other of those who were wealthy. The burgesses had lostall real share in the government. The magistrates wereinstruments without independence in the hands of the holderof power for the time being. The civic community of Romehad broken down by its unnatural enlargement. The Italianconfederacy had been merged in the civic community. Thebody of extra-Italian allies was in full course of being con­verted into a body of subjects. The whole organic classifi­cation of the Roman commonwealth had gone to wreck, andnothing was left but a crude mass of more or less disparateelements. The state of matters threatened to end in utteranarchy and in the inward and outward dissolution of thestate. The political movement tended thoroughly towardsthe goal of despotism; the only point still in dispute waswhether the close circle of the noble families, or the senateof capitalists, or a monarch was to be despot. The politicalmovement followed thoroughly the paths that led to des­potism; the fundamental principle of a free commonwealth—that the contending powers should reciprocally confinethemselves to indirect coercion—had become effete in theeyes of all parties alike, and on both sides the fight forpower began to be carried on first by the bludgeon, and

takings finally miscarried through the perfidy of those whomhe trusted. At the same time we meet with isolated traitsof high-minded justice: when he punished traitors, he ordi­narily spared those who were involved in the crime solelythrough their personal relations with the leading culprit; butsuch fits of equity are to be met with in every barbaroustyrant. What really distinguishes Mithradates amidst themultitude of similar sultans, is his boundless activity. Hedisappeared one fine morning from his palace and remainedunheard of for months, so that he was given over as lost; whenhe returned, he had wandered incognito through all anteriorAsia and reconnoitred everywhere the country and thepeople. In like manner he was not only generally fluent inspeech, but he administered justice to each of the twenty-two nations over which he ruled in its own language withoutneeding an interpreter—a trait significant of the versatileruler of the many-tongued East. His whole activity as aruler bears the same character. So far as we know (forour authorities are unfortunately altogether silent as to hisinternal administration) his energies, like those of everyother sultan, were spent in collecting treasures, in assemblingarmies—which were usually, in his earlier years at least, ledagainst the enemy not by the king in person, but by someGreek condottiere—in efforts to add new satrapies to theold. Of higher elements—desire to advance civilization,earnest leadership of the national opposition, special gifts ofgenius—there are found, in our traditional accounts at least,no distinct traces in Mithradates, and we have no reason toplace him on a level even with the great rulers of the Os-maus, such as Mahomet II. and Suleiman. Notwithstand­ing his Hellenic culture, which sat on him not much betterthan the Eoman armour on his Cappadocians, he wasthroughout an Oriental of the ordinary stamp, coarse, full ofthe most sensual appetites, superstitious, cruel, perfidious,and unscrupulous, but so vigorous in organization, so power­ful in physical endowments, that his defiant laying about himand his unshaken courage in resistance frequently look liketalent, sometimes even like genius. Granting even, thatduring the death-struggle of the republic it was easier to offerresistance to Rome than in the times of Scipio or Trajan, andthat it was only the complication of the Asiatic events withthe internal commotions of Italy that rendered it possible forMithradates to resist the Romans twice as long as Jugurtha

While the Eoman aris­tocracy thus took care of itself and got whatever occupiedland was still in its hands converted into its own property,it at the same time pacified the Italian allies, not indeed byconferring on them the property of the Latin domain-landwhich they and more especially their municipal aristocracyenjoyed, but by preserving unimpaired the rights in rela­tion to it guaranteed to them by their charters. The oppo­site party was in the unfortunate position, that in the mostimportant material questions the interests of the Italiansran diametrically counter to those of the opposition in thecapital; in fact the Italians entered into a species of leaguewith the Roman government, and sought and found protec­tion from the senate against the extravagant designs ofvarious Eoman demagogue^.

Sicilian militia, and in capturing his camp. By this meansalmost the whole island came into the power of the insur­gents, whose numbers, according to the most moderateestimates, are alleged to have amounted to 70,000 mencapable of arms. The Romans found themselves compelled134-132. for three successive years (620-622) to despatch consuls andconsular armies to Sicily, till, after several undecided andeven some unfavourable conflicts, the revolt was at lengthsubdued by the capture of Tauromenium and of Enna.The most resolute men of the insurgents threw themselvesinto the latter town, in order to defend themselves in thatimpregnable position with the determination of men whodespair of deliverance or of pardon; the consuls LuciusCalpurnius Piso and Publius Rupilius lay before it fortwo years, and reduced it at last more by famine than byarms.*
These were the results of the preventive police system, asit was handled by the Roman senate and its officials inItaly and the provinces. While the task of getting quit ofthe proletariate demands and only too often transcends thewhole power and wisdom of a government, its repressionby measures of police on the other hand is for any largercommonwealth comparatively easy. It would be well withstates, if the unpropertied masses threatened them withno other danger than that with which they are menaced bybears and wolves; only the timid and those who trade uponthe silly fears of the multitude prophesy the destruction ofcivil order through servile revolts or insurrections of the pro­letariate. But even to this easier task of restraining theoppressed masses the Roman government was by no meansequal, notwithstanding the profound peace and the inex­haustible resources of the state. This was a sign of itsweakness; but not of its weakness alone. By right theRoman governor was bound to keep the highways clear andto have the robbers who were caugnt crucified, if they wereslaves; and that as a matter of course, for slavery is notpossible without a reign of terror. At this period inSicily a razzia was occasionally no doubt set on foot by thegovernor, if the roads were too insecure; but, in order not todisoblige the Italian planters, the captive robbers were

during the suspension of hostilities the chief business of theRoman soldiery, but not a few officers and soldiers had aswell as their generals entered into secret understandingwith the enemy. It is easy to see that such an army coulddo nothing in the field; and if Jugurtha on this occa­sion bribed the Roman general into inaction, as was after­wards judicially asserted against the latter, he did intruth what was superfluous. Spurius" Albinus thereforecontented himself with doing nothing. On the other handhis brother who after his departure assumed the interimcommand—the equally foolhardy and incapable Aulus Pos-tumius—in the middle of winter fell on the idea of seizingby a bold coup de main the treasures of the king, which werekept in the town of Suthul (afterwards Calama, nowGuelma) difficult of access and still more difficult of con­quest. The army set out thither and reached the town ; butthe siege was unsuccessful and without prospect of result,and, when the king who had remained for a time with histroops in front of the town went into the desert, theRoman general preferred to pursue him. This was pre­cisely what Jugurtha intended ; in a nocturnal assault, whichwas favoured by the difficulties of the ground and thesecret understanding which Jugurtha had with some in theRoman army, the Numidians captured the Roman camp,and drove the Romans, many of whom were unarmed, beforethem in the most complete and disgraceful rout. The con- Capitula-sequence was a capitulation, the terms of which—the march- tion of theing off of the Roman army under the yoke, the immediate Romans.evacuation of the whole Numidian territory, and the re- ^newal of the treaty cancelled by the senate—were dictatedby Jugurtha and accepted by the Romans (in the beginningof 645).

Neither the commissionssent by the senate (590), nor the foreign arbiters, such as 164.Scipio -iEmilianus (603) called in after the Greek fashion bythe Macedonians, were able to establish any tolerable order. 151.Suddenly there appeared in Thrace a young man, who calledhimself Philip the son of king Perseus, whom he strikinglyresembled, and of the Syrian Laodice. He had passed hisyouth in the Mysian town of Adramyttium; there heasserted that he had preserved the sure proofs of hisillustrious descent. With these he had, after a vain attemptto obtain recognition in his native country, resorted toDemetrius Soter, king of Syria, his mother's brother. Therewere in fact some who believed the Adramyttene or pro­fessed to believe him, and urged the king either to reinstatethe prince in his hereditary kingdom or to cede to him thecrown of Syria; whereupon Demetrius, to put an end tothe foolish proceeding, arrested the pretender and sent himto the Romans. But the senate attached so little import­ance to the man, that it confined him in an Italian townwithout taking steps to have him even seriously guarded.Thus he had escaped to Miletus, where the civic autho­rities once more seized him and asked the Roman commis­sioners what they should do with the prisoner. The latteradvised them to let him go; and they did so. He nowtried his fortune further in Thrace; and, singularly enough,he obtained recognition and support there not only fromTeres the chief of the Thracian barbarians, the husband ofhis father's sister, and Barsabas, but also from the prudentByzantines. With Thracian support the so-called Philipinvaded Macedonia, and, although he was defeated at first,he soon gained one victory over the Macedonian militia in thedistrict of Odomantice beyond the Strymon, followed by asecond on the west side of the river, which gave him posses­sion of all Macedonia. Apocryphal as his story sounded,and decidedly as it was established that the real Philip, theson of Perseus, had died when eighteen years of age at Alba,and that this man, so far from being a Macedonian prince,was Andriscus a fuller of Adramyttium, yet the Macedo­nians were too much accustomed to the rule of a king notto be readily satisfied on the point of legitimacy and toreturn with pleasure into the old paths.

Chap. VI.] AND THE ATTEMPT OF DRUSUS AT REFORM. 221


Drusus was, like his father, of strictly conservative views,and had already given practical proof that such were hissentiments in the insurrection of Saturninus. He belongedto the circle of the highest nobility, and was the possessorof a colossal fortune; in disposition too he was a genuinearistocrat—a man emphatically proud, who scorned to bedeckhimself with the insignia of his offices, but declared on hisdeath-beo. that there would not soon arise a citizen like him;a man with whom the beautiful saying, that nobility consti­tutes obligation, was and continued to be the rule of his life.With all the vehement earnestness of his temperament hehad turned away from the frivolity and venality that markedthe nobles of the common stamp; trustworthy and strict inmorals, he was respected rather thau properly beloved onthe part of the common people, to whom his door and hispurse were always open, and notwithstanding his youth, hewas through the personal dignity of his character a man ofweight in the senate as in the Forum. Nor did he standalone. Marcus Scaurus had the courage on occasion of hisdefence in his trial for extortion publicly to summon Drususto undertake a reform of the judicial arrangements; he andthe famous orator, Lucius Crassus, were in the senate themost zealous champions of his proposals, and were perhapsassociated with him in originating them. But the mass ofthe governing aristocracy was by no means of the same mindwith Drusus, Scaurus, and Crassus. There were not want­ing in the senate decided adherents of the capitalist party,among whom in particular there made themselves conspicuousthe consul of the day, Lucius Marcius Philippus, who main­tained the cause of the equestrian order as he had formerlymaintained that of the democracy (P. 138) with zeal andprudence, and the daring and reckless Quintus Caepio, whowas induced to this opposition primarily by his personalhostility to Drusus and Scaurus. More dangerous, how­ever, than these decided opponents was the cowardly andcorrupt mass of the aristocracy, who no doubt would havepreferred to plunder the provinces alone, but in the end hadnot much objection to share the spoil with the equites, and,instead of taking in hand the grave and perilous struggleagainst the haughty capitalists, reckoned it far more equita­ble and easy to purchase impunity at their hands by fair wordsand by an occasional prostration or even by a round sum.The result alone could show how far success would attend

bounds of Italy and began to pass beyond them; it camealso to acquire intrinsically a deeper intellectual basis. Wefind it in the course of creating a classical literature, and ahigher instruction of its own; and, though in comparisonwith the Hellenic classics and Hellenic culture we may feelourselves tempted to attach little value to the feeble hot­house products of Italy, yet, so far as its historical develop­ment was primarily concerned, the quality of the Latinclassical literature and the Latin culture was of far lessmoment than the fact that they subsisted side by side withthe Greek; and, sunken as were the contemporary Hellenesin a literary point of view, one might perhaps apply in thiscase also the saying of the poet, that the living day-laboureris better than the dead Achilles.
But, however rapidly and vigorously the Latin language Hellenism.and nationality gain ground, they at the same time recog­nize the Hellenic nationality as having an entirely equal,indeed an earlier and better title, and enter everywhere intothe closest alliance with it or become intermingled with it ina joint development. The Italian revolution, which otherwiselevelled all the non-Latin nationalities in the peninsula, didnot disturb the Greek cities of Tarentum, Rhegium, Nea-polis, Locri (P. 249). In like manner Massilia, althoughnow enclosed by Roman territory, remained a Greek cityand in that very capacity firmly connected with Rome. "Withthe complete Latinizing of Italy an increased Hellenizingwent hand in hand. In the higher circles of Italian societyGreek training became an integral element of their nativeculture. The consul of 623, the pontifex maximus Publius 131.Crassus, excited the astonishment even of the native Greeks,when as governor of Asia he delivered his judicial decisions,as the case required, sometimes in ordinary Greek, some­times in one of the four dialects used as written languages.And if the Italian literature and art for long looked steadilytowards the East, Hellenic literature and art now began tolook towards the West. Not only did the Greek cities inItaly maintain a lively intellectual intercourse with Greece,Asia Minor, and Egypt, and confer on the Greek poets andactors who had acquired celebrity there the like recognitionand the like honours among themselves; in Rome also,after the example set by the destroyer of Corinth at histriumph in 608, the gymnastic and aesthetic recreations of 146.the Greeks—competitions in wrestling as well as in musics

Itis probable, moreover, that the words of Horace that "captive Greece ledcaptive her conquerors" primarily refer to these epoch-making theatrical gamesof Mummius (Tac. Ann. xiv. 21).

Hitherto the machinery for thunder had consisted in theshaking of nails and stones in a copper kettle; Puleher first produced a betterthunder by rolling stones, which was thenceforth named " Claudian thunder"(Festus v.

ther designs became unveiled, a change took place; he couldnot venture to bring in his chief law; he had to postpone,he had to delay, he had soon to retire. It was reported thatthe majority of the senate was vacillating and threatened tofall away from its leaders; in rapid succession the tidingsran through the communities of Italy, that the law whichhad passed was annulled, that the capitalists ruled moreabsolutely than ever, that the tribune had been struck bythe hand of an assassin, that he was dead (autumn of 663). 91.
The last hope that the Italians might obtain admission to Prepara-Boman citizenship by agreement was buried with Marcus tions ,ilrDrusus. A measure, which that conservative and energetic Se°eral f'man had not been able under the most favourable circum- Kome.Si"ni.stances to induce his own party to adopt, was not to begained at all by amicable means. The Italians had no courseleft to them save to submit patiently or to repeat once more,and if possible with their united strength, the attempt whichhad been crushed in the bud five-and-thirty years beforeby the destruction of Fregellae—so as by force of arms eitherto destroy Home and succeed to her heritage, or at least tocompel her to grant equality of rights. The latter resolu­tion was no doubt a resolution of despair; as matters stood,the revolt of the isolated urban communities against theltoman government might well appear still more hopelessthan the revolt of the American colonies against the Britishempire; to all appearance the Roman government mightwith moderate attention and energy of action consign thissecond insurrection to the fate of its predecessor. But wasit less perhaps a resolution of despair, to sit still and allowthings to take their course? When they recollected howthe Romans had been in the habit of behaving in Italywithout provocation, what could they expect now that themost considerable meu in every Italian town had or werealleged to have had—the consequences on either suppositionbeing pretty mucfi the same—an understanding with Drusus,.which was immediately directed against the party now vic­torious and might well be characterized as treason?

But this march in the plain threatened tobecome the destruction of the army; for, while Numidian in­fantry occupied the mountain defiles in the rear of theRomans as the latter evacuated them, the Roman attackingcolumn found itself assailed on all sides by swarms of theenemy's horse, who charged down on it from the ridge. Theconstant onset of the hostile swarms hindered the advance,and the battle threatened to resolve itself into a number ofconfused and detached conflicts; while at the same timeBomilcar with his division detained the corps under Rufusto prevent it from hastening to the help of the hard-pressedmain army. Nevertheless Metellus and Marius with acouple of thousand soldiers succeeded in reaching the foot ofthe ridge; and the Numidian infantry which defended theheights, in spite of their superior numbers and favourableposition, fled almost without resistance when the legion­aries charged at a rapid pace up the hill. The Numidianinfantry held its ground equally ill against Rufus; it was •
scattered at the first charge, and the elephants were allkilled or captured on the broken ground. Late in the even­ing the two Roman divisions, each victorious on its own partand each anxious as to the fate of the other, met betweenthe two fields of battle. It was a battle attesting alikeJugurtha's uncommon military talent and the indestructiblesolidity of the Roman infantry, which alone had convertedtheir strategical defeat into a victory. Jugurtha sent home agreat part of his troops after the battle, and restricted himselfto a guerilla warfare, which he likewise managed with skill.

not a footing sufficiently firm singly to maintain the coloniallaw which he had himself called in question and to possesshimself of the position which it assigned to him, nor wereSaturninus and Glaucia in a condition to continue on theirown account the work which Marius had begun.Saturninus But the two demagogues were so compromised that theyisolated. could not recede ; they had no alternative save to resign theiroffices in the usual way and thereby to deliver themselveswith their hands bound to their exasperated opponents, ornow to grasp the sceptre for themselves, although they feltthat they could not bear its weight. They resolved on thelatter course; Saturninus would come forward once more as99. a candidate for the tribunate of the people for 655, Glaucia,although praetor and not eligible for the consulship till twoyears had elapsed, would become a candidate for the latter.In fact the tribunician elections were decided thoroughly totheir mind, and the attempt of Marius to prevent the spuriousTiberius Gracchus from soliciting the tribuneship served onlyto show the celebrated man what was now the worth of hispopularity; the multitude broke the doors of the prison inwhich Gracchus was confined, bore him in triumph throughthe streets, and elected him by a great majority as theirtribune. Saturninus and Glaucia sought to control the moreimportant consular election by the expedient for the removalof inconvenient competitors which had been tried in the pre­vious year; the counter-candidate of the government-party,Gaius Memmius—the same who eleven years before had ledthe opposition against them (P. 150)—was suddenly assailedSaturninus by a band of ruffians and beaten to death. But the govern-assailed, ment-party had only waited for a striking event of this sortin order to employ force. The senate required the consulGaius Marius to interfere, and the latter in reality professedhis readiness now to draw in behalf of the conservative partythe sword, which he had obtained from the democracy andhad promised to wield in its favour. The young men werehastily called out, equipped with arms from the public build­ings, and drawn up in military array; the senate itself ap­peared under arms in the Forum, with its venerable chiefMarcus Scaurus at its head. The opposite party were per­haps superior in a street-tumult, but were not preparedfor such an attack; they had to defend themselves as theycould. They broke open the doors of the prisons, and calledthe slaves to liberty and to arms; they proclaimed—so it

commercial rivals who were disagreeable to him were clearedaway by the armies of the state, and the most glorious citiesof neighbouring lands were sacrificed, not to the barbarismof the lust of power, but to the far more horrible barbarism ofspeculation. Thus too arose the new military organization orrather disorganization, whereby the state, which yet wassolely dependent in the last resort on its military superio­rity, undermined its own support. The fleet was allowedto go to ruin; the system of land-warfare fell into themost incredible decay. The duty of guarding the Asiaticand African frontiers was devolved on the subjects; andwhat could not be so devolved, such as the defence of thefrontier in Italy, Macedonia, and Spain, was managed afterthe most wretched fashion. The better classes began todisappear so much from the army, that it was alreadydifficult to raise the necessary number of officers for theSpanish armies. The daily increasing aversion to theSpanish war-service in particular, combined with the par­tiality shown by the magistrates in the levy, rendered itnecessary in 602 to abandon the old practice of leaving the 152.selection of the requisite number of soldiers from the menliable to serve to the free discretion of the officers, and tosubstitute for it a drawing of the necessary number by ballot,certainly not to the advantage of the military esprit de corps,or of the aptitude for war of the individual divisions. Theauthorities, instead of acting with vigour and strictness,extended their pitiful flattery of the people even to this.field; whenever a consul in the discharge of his duty insti­tuted rigorous levies for the Spanish service, the tribunesmade use of their constitutional right to arrest him (603, 151.616); and it has been already observed, that Scipio's request 138.that he should be allowed a levy for the Numantine war,was directly rejected by the senate. Accordingly, the Romanarmies before Carthage or Numantia already remind oneof those Syrian armies, in which the number of bakers,cooks, actors, and other non-combatants exceeded fourfoldthat of the so-called soldiers; already the Roman generalsare little behind their Carthaginian colleagues in the art ofdestroying armies, and the wars in Africa as in Spain, in Ma­cedonia as in Asia, are regularly opened with defeats; themurder of Gnaeus Octavius is now passed over in silence;the assassination of Viriathus is now a masterpiece of Ro­man diplomacy; the conquest of Numantia is now a great

From Mace­donia, where the Cappadocians had meanwhile definitelyestablished themselves, plentiful and regular supplies arrivedby sea, which Sulla was not in a condition to cut off fromthe harbour-fortress; in Athens no doubt provisions werebeginning to fail, but from the proximity of the two for­tresses Archelaus was enabled to make various attempts tothrow quantities of grain into Athens, which were not wholly87-86. unsuccessful. So the winter of 667-8 passed away tediouslywithout result. As soon as the season allowed, Sulla threwhimself with vehemence on the Piraeeus; he in fact suc­ceeded by missiles and mines in making a breach in part ofthe strong walls of Pericles, and immediately the Romans ad­vanced to the assault; but it was repulsed, and on its beingrenewed crescent-shaped entrenchments were found con­structed behind the fallen walls, from which the invadersfound themselves assailed on three sides with missiles andcompelled to retire. Sulla then abandoned the siege, andcontented himself with a blockade.

did not fail to supply partly on account of the need for them,partly on account of vanity and money. Such a manualof rhetoric has been preserved to us, composed under Sulla'sdictatorship by an unknown author, who according to thefashion then prevailing (P. 443) taught simultaneouslyliterature and Latin rhetoric, and wrote on both; a treatiseremarkable not merely for its close, clear, and firm handlingof the subject, but above all for its comparative indepen­dence as respects Greek models. Although in method en­tirely dependent on the Greeks, the Roman yet distinctlyand even abruptly rejects all "the useless matter whichthe Greeks had gathered together, solely in order that thescience might appear more difficult to learn." The bitterestcensure is bestowed on the hair-splitting dialectics—that"loquacious science of inability to speak "—whose finishedmaster, for sheer fear of expressing himself ambiguously, atlast no longer ventures to pronounce his own name. TheGreek school-terminology is throughout and intentionallyavoided. Very earnestly the author points out the danger ofmany teachers, and inculcates the golden rule that the scholarought above all to be trained by the teacher to help himself;with equal earnestness he recognizes the truth that the schoolis a secondary, and life the main, matter, and gives in hisexamples chosen with thorough independence an echo ofthose forensic speeches which during the last decades hadexcited notice in the Roman advocate-world. It deservesattention, that the opposition to the extravagances of Hel­lenism, which had formerly sought to prevent the rise of anative Latin rhetoric (P. 443), continued to influence itafter it arose, and thereby secured to Roman eloquence, ascompared with the contemporary eloquence of the Greeks,theoretically and practically a higher dignity and a greaterusefulness.
Philosophy, in fine, was not yet represented in literature, Philosophy,since neither did an inward need develop a national Eomanphilosophy nor did outward circumstances call forth a Latinphilosophical authorship.

But therewas no want also of vivid delineation, of grotesque inci­dents, of telling jokes, and of pithy sayings; and the harle­quinade rapidly won for itself no inconsiderable position inthe theatrical life of the capital and even in literature.Dramatic Lastly as regards the development of dramatic arrange-arrange- ments, we are not in a position to set forth in detail—what isments. clear on the whole—that the general interest in dramaticperformances was constantly on the increase, and that theybecame more and more frequent and magnificent. Notonly was there hardly any ordinary or extraordinary popularfestival that was now celebrated without dramatic exhibi­tions; even in the country-towns and in private housesrepresentations by companies of hired actors were common.It is true that, while probably various municipal towns alreadyat this time possessed theatres built of stone, the capital wasstill without one; the building of a theatre, already con-155. tracted for, had been again prohibited by the senate in 599on the suggestion of Publius Scipio Nasica. It was quite inthe spirit of the sanctimonious policy of this age, that thebuilding of a permanent theatre was prohibited out ofrespect for the customs of their ancestors, but neverthelesstheatrical entertainments were allowed rapidly to increase,and enormous sums were expended annually in erecting anddecorating structures of boards for the purpose. Thearrangements of the stage became visibly better. Theimproved mise en seem and the reintroduction of masks aboutthe time of Terence are doubtless connected with the fact,that the erection and maintenance of the stage and stage-174. apparatus were charged in 580 on the public chest.* Theplays which Lucius Mummius produced after the capture145. of Corinth (609) formed an epoch in the history of thetheatre.

War has hardly everbeen waged with so much perfidy, cruelty, and avarice asby these two generals; yet by means of their criminallyacquired treasures the one escaped condemnation, and theother escaped even impeachment. The veteran Cato in hiseighty-fifth year, a few months before his death, attemptedto bring Galba to account before the burgesses; but theweeping children of the general, and the gold which he hadbrought home with him, demonstrated to the Roman peoplehis innocence.
It was not so much the inglorious successes which Lucul- Viriathus.lus and Galba had attained in Spain, as the outhreak of thefourth Macedonian and of the third Carthaginian war in605, which induced the Romans again to leave Spanish 149affairs for a time in the hands of the ordinary governors.Whereupon the Lusitanians, exasperated rather than hum­bled by Galba's perfidy, immediately overran afresh the richterritory of Turdetania. The Roman governor Gaius Veti-lius (605 ?*) marched against them, and not only defeated 149.them, but drove the whole host towards a hill where itseemed lost irretrievably. The capitulation was virtually con­cluded, when Viriathus—a man of humble origin, who for­merly, when a youth, had bravely defended bis-flock from wildbeasts and robbers and was now in more serious conflicts adreaded guerilla chief, and who was one of the few Spaniardsthat had accidentally escaped from the perfidious onslaughtof Galba—warned his countrymen against relying on theRoman word of honour, and promised them deliverance ifthey would follow him. His language and his example


* The chronology of the war with Viriathus is far from being preciselysettled. It is certain that the appearance of Viriathus dates from the conflictwith Vetilius (Appian, Hisp. 61 ; Justin, xliv. 2), and that he perished in 615; 139.the duration of his government is reckoned at eight (Appian, Hisp. 63), ten(Justin, xliv. 2), eleven (Diodorus, p. 597), or fourteen years (Liv. liv.;Eutrop. iv. 16; Fior. i. 33). The third estimate possesses some probability,because the conflict with Vetilius is closely associated with the governorshipof Galba. On the other hand, the series of Roman governors is quite uncer­tain for the following period down to 608; and the more so because Viriathus, 146.while operating chiefly in the southern, fought also in the northern province(Liv. lii.), and thus his Roman antagonists did not belong solely to one set ofgovernors.

These Celtichordes streaming along on both sides of the Alps had aftertheir fashion occupied chiefly the flat and hill country; theAlpine region proper and likewise the district along theAdige and the lower Po were not occupied by them, andremained in the hands of the earlier indigenous population.Nothing certain has as yet been ascertained as to thenationality of the latter; but they appear under the nameof the Raeti in the mountains of East Switzerland and theTyrol, and under that of the Euganei and Veneti aboutPadua and Venice; so that at this last point the two greatCeltic streams almost touched each other, and only a narrowbelt of native population separated the Celtic Cenomani

Strab. vii. 293) states that the Boii, atthe time when they repulsed the Cimbri, inhabited the Hercynian Forest, •'. e.,the mountains from the Rauhe Alp to the Bohmerwald. The circumstancethat Caesar transplants them " beyond the Rhine " (B. G. i. 5) is by no meansinconsistent with this, for, as he there speaks from the Helvetian point ofview, he may very well mean the country to the north-east of the lake ofConstance; which quite accords with the fact, that Strabo (vii. 292) describesthe former Boian country as bordering on the lake of Constance, except that heis not quite accurate in naming along with them the Vindelici as dwelling bythe lake of Constance, for the latter only established themselves there afterthe Boii had evacuated these districts.

He always hoped that conflicts andbattles would occur and that the people would once moreneed his experienced arm; he thought to provide himselfwith an opportunity for war in the East, where the Romansmight certainly have found sufficient occasion for energeticinterference. But this also miscarried, like every other ofhis wishes; profound peace continued to prevail.

aristocracy and the narrow-minded bourgeoisie would dis­play the same stupid jealousy after the subduing of theinsurrection as they had displayed before its outbreak; thatthe great majority of all parties would secretly or evenopenly characterize the partial concessions made at themoment of the most formidable danger as unseasonablecompliances, and would passionately resist every attemptto extend them. The example of Drusus had shown whatcame of undertaking to carry conservative reforms solelyin reliance on a senatorial majority; it was a course quiteintelligible, that his friend who shared his views shouldattempt to carry out kindred designs in opposition to thatmajority and under the forms of demagogism. Rufus accord­ingly gave himself no trouble to gain the senate over to hisviews by the bait of the jury courts. He found a bettersupport in the freedmen and above all in the armed retinue—consisting, according to the report of his opponents, of3000 hired men and an "opposition-senate" of 600 youngmen from the better class—with which he appeared in thestreets and in the Forum.
His proposals accordingly met with the most decidedresistance from the majority of the senate, which first, togain time, induced the consuls Lucius Cornelius Sulla andQuintus Pompeius Rufus, both declared opponents of dema­gogism, to enjoin extraordinary religious observances duringwhich the popular assemblies were suspended. Sulpiciusreplied by a violent tumult, in which among other victimsthe young Quintus Pompeius, son of the one and son-in-lawof the other consul, met his death and the lives of both con­suls themselves were seriously threatened—Sulla is saideven to have escaped only by Marius opening to him hishouse. They were obliged to yield; Sulla agreed to counter­mand the announced solemnities, and the Sulpician proposalsnow passed without further difficulty. But this was farfrom determining their fate. Though the aristocracy in thecapital might own its defeat, there was now-—for the firsttime since the commencement of the revolution—yet anotherpower in Italy which could not be overlooked, viz. the twostrong and victorious armies of the proconsul Strabo andthe consul Sulla.

The envoys 112-111.of Jugurtha were dismissed from Italy without being ad­mitted to an audience; the new consul Lucius CalpurniusBestia, who was distinguished, among the members of hisorder at least, by judgment and activity, prosecuted the war­like preparations with energy; Marcus Scaurus himselftook the post of a commander in the African army. Ina short time a Roman army was on African ground, andmarching upward along the Bagradas (Mejerdah) advancedinto the Numidian kingdom, where the towns most remotefrom the seat of the royal power, such as Great Leptis,voluntarily sent in their submission, while Bocchus king ofMauretania, although his daughter was married to Jugurtha,offered friendship and alliance to the Romans. Jugurthahimself lost courage, and sent envoys to the Roman head­quarters to request an armistice. The end of the contestseemed near, and came still more rapidly than was expected.The treaty with Bocchus broke down, because the king, un­acquainted with Roman customs, had conceived that heshould be able to conclude a treaty so advantageous for theRomans withouc any gratuity, and therefore had neglectedto furnish his envoys with the usual market price of Romanalliances. Jugurtha at all events knew Roman institutionsbetter, and had not omitted to support his proposals for anarmistice by a due accompaniment of money; but he toowas deceived. After the first negotiations it turned out,that not an armistice merely but a peace was purchaseable atthe Roman head-quarters. The royal treasury was still wellfilled with the savings of Massinissa; the transaction wassoon settled.

Disorders of this sort were permanentfeatures of the Asiatic empire: the provinces under theirpartially or wholly independent satraps were in continualrevolt, as was also the capital with its insubordinate and re­fractory populace resembling those of Rome and Alexandria.The whole pack of neighbouring kings—those of Egypt,Armenia, Cappadocia, Pergamus—incessantly interfered inthe affairs of Syria and fostered disputes as to the succes­sion, so that civil war and the division of the sovereignty inpoint of fact among two or more pretenders became almoststanding calamities of the country. The Roman pro­tecting power, if it did not instigate these neighbours, wasan inactive spectator. In addition to all this the newParthian empire from the eastward pressed hard on the aliensnot merely with its material power, but with the wholesuperiority of its national language and religion and of itsnational military and political organization. This is not yetthe place for a description of the revived empire of Cyrus; itis sufficient to mention generally the fact., that powerful aswas the influence of Hellenism in its composition, the Parthianstate, as compared with that of the Seleucidae, was based ona national and religious reaction, and that the old Iranianlanguage, the order of the Magi and the worship of Mithra,the oriental feudal constitution, the cavalry of the desertand the bow and arrow, first emerged there in renewedand triumphant opposition to Hellenism. The position ofthe kings of Syria in presence of all this was really pitiable.The family of the Seleucidas was by no means so enervatedas that of the Lagidas for instance, and some of them werenot deficient in valour and ability; they reduced it may beone or another of those numerous rebels, pretenders, andintermeddlers to order; but their dominion had so little ofa firm foundation that it was unable to impose even atemporary check on anarchy. The result was inevitable.The eastern provinces of Syria under their unprotected oreven insurgent satraps fell into subjection to the Parthians;Persia, Babylonia, Media were for ever severed from theSyrian empire; the new state of the Parthians reached onboth sides of the great desert from the Oxus and the HindooCoosh to the Tigris and the desert of Arabia—once more,like the Persian empire and all the older great states of Asia,a. pure continental monarchy, and once more, just like thePersian empire, engaged in perpetual feud on the one side

the Romans chose the spot where Gaius Sextius defeatedthe Celts, and where the pleasantness and fertility of theregion as well as the numerous hot and cold springs invitedthem to settlement; a Roman township sprang up there—the "baths of Sextius," Aquae Sextiae (Aix). To the westof the Rhone the Romans settled in Karbo, an ancientCeltic town on the navigable river Atax (Aude) at a smalldistance from the sea, which is already mentioned by Heca-tous, and which even before its occupation by the Eomanswas the rival of Massilia as a place of stirring commerce,and as sharing the trade in British tin. Aquae did not obtaincivic rights, but remained a standing camp ;* whereas Narbo,although in like manner founded mainly as a sentinel out­post against the Celts, became, as " Mars' town," a Romanburgess-colony and the usual seat of the governor of thenew Transalpine Celtic province or, as it was more frequentlycalled, the province of Narbo.

The fall of Gaius Gracchus, no doubt,gave occasion here also to restrictions on the acquisition ofterritory and still more on the founding of cities; but, if thedesign was not carried out in its full extent, it was at anyrate not wholly frustrated. The territory acquired and,still more, the foundation of Narbo—a settlement on whichthe senate vainly endeavoured to inflict the fate of that atCarthage—remained standing as parts of an unfinishedstructure, exhorting the future successor of Gracchus tocontinue the building.

The various attempts that had been recently made toestablish a tyrannis under the form of a consulship continuedfor several successive years led to special rigour in dealingwith this abuse; and it was enacted that at least two yearsshould elapse between the holding of one magistracy andthe holding of another, and at least ten years should elapsebefore the same office could be held a second time. In thislatter enactment the earlier ordinance of 412 (i. 321) was 342.revived, instead of the absolute prohibition of all re-electionto the consulship which had been the favourite of the mostrecent ultra-oligarchical epoch (P. 72). On the whole,however, Sulla left the elections to take their course, andsought merely to fetter the authority of the magistrates insuch a way that—let the incalculable caprice of the comitiacall to office whomsoever it might—the person elected shouldnot be in a position to rebel against the oligarchy.
The supreme magistrates of the state were at this period Weakeningpractically the three colleges of the tribunes of the people, of the tri-the consuls and praetors, and the censors. They all emerged ?^mte ,from the Sullan restoration with materially diminishedrights; more especially the tribunician office, which appearedto the regent an instrument indispensable doubtless forsenatorial government, but yet—as generated by revolutionand having a constant tendency to generate fresh revolutionsin its turn—requiring to be rigorously and permanentlyshackled. The tribunician authority had arisen out of theright to annul the official acts of the magistrates by veto, and,eventually, to fine any one who should oppose that right andto take steps for his further punishment; this was still leftto the tribunes, excepting that a heavy fine, destroying as arule a man's civil status, was imposed on the abuse of theright of intercession. The further prerogative of the tri­bune to have access to the people at pleasure, partly for thepurpose of making communications to them, partly for thepurpose of submitting laws to be voted on, had been the leverby which the Gracchi, Saturniuus, and Sulpicius had revo­lutionized the state; it was not abolished, but its exercise

Even the full liberty of migration belonging to theOld Latin burgesses, which procured for such of their membersas transferred their abode to Rome the civitas sine suffragiothere, had been curtailed in a manner offensive to the com­munities concerned (ii. 334). They now advanced a step fur­ther: on occasion of the agitation which contemplated theextension of the Roman franchise to all Italy in the years628, 632, the right of migration to Rome was itself attacked, 126. 122.and all the non-burgesses resident in Rome were directlyejected by decree of the people and of the senate from thecapital (P. 106, 124)—a measure as odious on account of itsilliberality, as dangerous from the various private interestswhich it injuriously affected. In short, while the Italianallies had formerly stood to the Romans partly in the rela­tion of brothers under tutelage, protected rather than ruledand not destined to perpetual minority, partly in that ofslaves tolerably treated and not utterly deprived of the hopeof manumission, they were now all of them subject nearly inequal degree, and with equal hopelessness, to the rods andaxes of their Roman masters, and might at the utmost pre­sume like privileged slaves to transmit the kicks receivedfrom their masters onward to the poor provincials.

tion, and a judicious and experienced warrior. In thisrespect he was so far free from the prejudices of his order,that he selected as his lieutenants not men of the nobility,but the excellent officer Publius Rutilius Rufus, who wasesteemed in military circles for his exemplary discipline andas the author of an altered and .improved system of drill,and the brave Latin farmer's son Gaius Marius, who hadrisen from the pike. Attended by these and other able,officers, Metellus presented himself iu the course of 645 as 109.consul and commander in chief to the African army, whichhe found in such disorder, that the generals had not hithertoventured to lead it iuto the enemy's territory and it wasformidable to none save the unhappy inhabitants of theRoman province. It was sternly and speedily reorganized,and in the spring of 646* Metellus led it over the Numidian 108.frontier. When Jugurtha perceived the altered state ofthings, he gave himself up as lost, and, before the strugglebegan, made earnest proposals for an accommodation, re­questing ultimately nothing more than a guarantee for his


* In the fascinating and clever description of this war by Sallust the chronologyhas been unduly neglected. The war terminated in the summer of 649 105(c. 114); if therefore Marius began his management of the war as consul in647, he held the command there in three campaigns. But the narrative 107.describes only two. To all appearance Metellus went to Africa as early as645, but, as he arrived late (c. 37, 44) and the reorganization of the army cost 109.time (c. 44), he only began his operations in the following year; and in likemanner Marius, who was likewise detained for a considerable time in Italyby his military preparations (c. 84), entered on the chief command either asconsul in 647 late in the season and after the close of the campaign, or only 107.as proconsul in 648; so that the two campaigns of Metellus thus fall in 646, 106. 108.647, and those of Marius in 648, 649. With this view the circumstance also 107. 106.very well accords, that the battle at Muthul and the siege of Zama must, 105.from the relation in which they stand to Marius' candidature for the consul­ship, be necessarily placed in 646. In no case can the author be pronounced 108.free from inaccuracies; Marius, for instance, is even spoken of by him asconsul in 649. 105.
The question would be easily settled, if the senate had prolonged the com­mand of Metellus and that prolongation had delayed Marius' departure; forthis could not apply to the campaign of 646, for which Marius could make 108.no claim at all to the command, but only to that of 647. But that hypo- 107.thesis, hitherto current, rests only on an interpolation of c. 73, 7 wanting inthe best manuscripts of both families, and is in itself improbable, for the de­cree of the senate could not in law trench on the resolution of the people, andSallust nowhere says one word as to Marius having voluntarily yielded so far,but rather the contrary. At the defective passage referred to there stoodprobably something quite ditferent—perhaps : [ei (Mario) uti Gallia provinciaies] set, paulo [ante senatus\ decreverat; ea res frustra fuit.

sonal interest. A similar but far less justifiable decree—theproposal, directed against Marcus Octavius, that whoeverhad been deprived of his office by decree of the peopleshould be for ever incapable of filling a public post^—wasrecalled by Gracchus at the request of his mother; and hewas thus spared the disgrace of openly mocking justice bylegalizing a notorious violation of the constitution, and oftaking base vengeance on a man- of honour, who had notspoken an angry word against Tiberius and had only actedconstitutionally and in accordance with what he conceivedto be his duty. But of very different importance fromthese measures was the scheme of Gaius—which, it is true,was hardly perhaps carried into effect—to reinforce thesenate by 300 new members, that is, just about as many asit previously had, and to have them elected from the eques­trian order by the comitia—a creation of peers after themost comprehensive style, which would have reduced thesenate into the most complete dependence on the chief ofthe state.
This was the political constitution which Gaius Gracchus Character ofprojected and, in its most essential points, carried out the constl-during the two years of his tribunate (631, (332), without, I"'.1°"'"so far as we can see, encountering any resistance worthy (jral;l;hul,of mention, and without requiring to apply force for the 123. 122.attainment of his ends. The order in which these measureswere carried can no longer be recognized in the brokenaccounts handed down to us, and various questions thatsuggest themselves have to remain unanswered. But it doesnot seem as if, in what is missing, many elements of mate­rial importance can have escaped us; for as to the principalmatters we have information entirely trustworthy, andGaius was by no means like his brother urged on further andfurther by the current of events, but evidently had a well-considered and comprehensive plan, the substance of whichhe fully embodied in a series of special laws.• Now the Sempronian constitution itself shows veryclearly to every one who is able and willing to see, thatGaius Gracchus did not at all, as many good-natured peoplein ancient and modern times have supposed, wish to placethe Roman republic on new democratic bases, but that onthe contrary he wished to abolish it and to introduce in itsstead a Tyrannis—that is, in modern language, a monarchynot of the feudal or of the theocratic, but of the Napoleonic

the party friendly to Rome then laid down—that theAchaeans were no longer at liberty to wage war without thepermission of the Romans—expressed, doubtless with disa­greeable precision, the simple truth that the formal sov-reignty of the dependent states was merely formal, and thatany attempt to give life to the shadow must necessarily leadto the destruction of the shadow itself. But the rulingcommunity deserves a censure more severe than that directedagainst the ruled. It is no easy task for a state any morethan for a man to become reconciled to insignificance;it is the duty and right of the ruler either to renounce hisauthority, or by the display of an imposing material supe­riority to compel the ruled to resignation. The Roman senatedid neither. Invoked and importuned on all hands, the senateinterfered incessantly in the course of African, Hellenic, Asi­atic, and Egyptian affairs; but it did so after so inconstantand loose a fashion, that its attempts to settle matters usuallyonly rendered the confusion worse. It was the epoch ofcommissions. Commissioners of the senate were constantlygoing to Carthage and Alexandria, to the Achaean diet, and tothe courts of the rulers of western Asia; they investigated, in­hibited, reported, and yet decisive steps were not unfrequentlytaken in the most important matters without the knowledge,or against the wishes, of the senate. Cyprus, for instance,which the senate had assigned to the kingdom of Cyrene,was nevertheless retained by Egypt; a Syrian prince as­cended the throne of his ancestors under the pretext thathe had obtained a promise of it from the Romans, while thesenate had in fact expressly refused to give it to him, andhe himself had only escaped from Rome by breaking theirinterdict; even the open murder of a Roman commissioner,who under the orders of the senate administered as guardianthe government of Syria, passed totally unpunished. TheAsiatics were very well aware that they were not in aposition to resist the Roman legions; but they were no lessaware that the senate was but little inclined to give thecitizens orders to march for the Euphrates or the Nile.Thus the state of these remote countries resembled thatof the schoolroom when the teacher is absent or lax; andthe government of Rome deprived the nations at onceof the blessings of freedom and of the blessings of order.For the Eomans themselves, moreover, this state of matterswas in so far perilous as it to a certain extent left their

"With unimpaired courage and increased resentment the Mancinus.Numantines resumed the struggle; Laenas fought againstthem unsuccessfully, nor was his successor Gaius HostiliusMancinus more fortunate (617). But their discomfiture 137.was occasioned not so much by the arms of the Numantines,as by the lax and wretched military discipline of theBoman generals and by—what was its natural consequence—the annually increasing dissoluteness, insubordination, andcowardice of the Roman soldiers. The mere rumour, whichmoreover was false, that the Cantabri and Vaccaei wereadvancing to the relief of Numantia, induced the Romanarmy to evacuate the camp by night without orders, and toseek shelter in the entrenchments constructed sixteen yearsbefore by Nobilior (P. 6). The Numantines, informedof their sudden departure, hotly pursued the fugitive army,and surrounded it: there remained to it no choice saveto fight its way with sword in hand through the enemy, orto conclude peace on the terms laid down by the Numan­tines. Although the consul was personally a man of honour,he was weak and little known. Tiberius Gracchus, whoserved in the army as quaestor, had more influence with theCeltiberians from the hereditary respect in which he washeld on account of his father who had so wisely regulatedthe province of the Ebro, and induced the Numantines tobe content with an equitable treaty of peace sworn to byall the staff-officers. But the senate not only recalled thegeneral immediately, but after long deliberation causeda proposal to be submitted to the burgesses that the con­vention should be treated as they had formerly treated thatof Caudium, in other words, that they should refuse itsratification and should devolve the responsibility on thosewho had concluded it. By right this category ought tohave included all the officers who had sworn to the treaty;but Gracchus and the others were saved by their connec­tions; Mancinus alone, who did not belong to the circle ofthe highest aristocracy, was destined to pay the penalty forhis own and others' guilt. Stripped of his insignia, theEoman consular was conducted to the enemy's outposts,and, when the Numantines refused to receive him thatthey might not on their part acknowledge the treaty asnull, the late commander-in-chief stood in his shirt andwith his hands tied behind his back for a whole day beforethe gates of Numantia, a pitiful spectacle to friend and foe.

While the aristocracy had formerly governedas it chose and for more than a century without any sensibleopposition, the crisis which it had now passed through re­vealed to it, like a flash of lightning in a dark night, theabyss which yawned before its feet. Was it any wonder thathenceforward rancour always, and terror wherever they durstattempt it, characterized the government of the lords of theold nobility? that those who governed confronted as anunited and compact party, with far more rudeness and vio­lence than hitherto, the non-governing multitude? thatfamily-policy now prevailed afresh, just as in the worst timesof the patriciate, so that e.g. the four sons and (probably)1 the two nephews of Quintus Metellus—with a single excep­tion persons utterly insignificant and some of them called tooffice on account of their very simplicity—attained withinfifteen years (631-645) all of them to the consulship, and all 123-109.with one exception also to triumphs—to say nothing of sons-in-law and so forth? that the more violent and cruel thebearing of any of their partisans towards the opposite party,he received the more signal honour, and every outrage andevery infamy were pardoned in the genuine aristocrat? thatthe governors and the governed resembled two parties atwar in every respect, save in the fact that in their warfareno international law was recognized? It was unhappilyonly too palpable that, if the old aristocracy beat the peoplewith rods, this restored aristocracy chastised it with scor­pions. It returned to power; but it returned neitherwiser nor better. Never hitherto had the Roman aristo­cracy been so utterly deficient in men of statesmanly andmilitary capacity, as it was during this epoch of restorationbetween the Gracchan and the Cinnan revolutions.
A significant illustration of this is afforded by the chief of Marcusthe senatorial party at this time, Marcus jEmilius Scaurus. ^miliusThe son of highly noble but not wealthy parents and there- Scaurus.fore compelled to make use of his far from mean talents, heraised himself to the consulship (639) and censorship (645), 115. 109.was long the chief of the senate and the political oracle of hisorder, and immortalized his name not only as an orator andauthor, but also as the originator of some of the principalpublic buildings executed in this century.

All its most essential features—admission to the senate by the holding of the quaestor-ship, the abolition of the censorial right to eject a senatorfrom the senate, the initiative of the senate in legislation, theconversion of the tribunician office into an instrument of thesenate for fettering the imperium, the prolonging of the dura­tion of office to two years, the transference of the commandfrom the popularly elected magistrate to the senatorial pro­consul or proprator, and even the new criminal and municipalarrangements—were not created by Sulla, but were institu­tions which had previously grown out of the oligarchic go­vernment and which he merely regulated and fixed. Andeven as to the horrors attaching to his restoration, the pro­scriptions and confiscations—are they, compared with thedoings of Nasica, Popillius, Opimius, Caepio and so on, any­thing else than a legal embodiment of the traditionaryoligarchic mode of getting rid of opponents? On theRoman oligarchy of this period no judgment can be passedsave one of inexorable and remorseless condemnation; and,like everything else connected with it, the Sullan constitutionis involved in that condemnation. But we do not wrong thesacredness of history through a praise which the gifted cha­racter of a bad man bribes us into bestowing, when we suggestthat Sulla was far less answerable for the Sullan restorationthan the body of the Roman aristocracy which had ruled asa clique for centuries and had every year become more ener­vated and embittered by age, and that all that was insipidand all that was infamous therein is ultimately traceable tothat aristocracy.

and striving probably appeared to him folly in a world, whichwithal was absolutely governed by chance, and in which, ifmen were to strive after anything at all, this chance could bethe only aim of their efforts. He followed the general tend­ency of the age to be addicted at once to unbelief and tosuperstition. His whimsical credulity was not the plebeiansuperstition of Marius, who got a priest to prophesy to himfor money and determined his actions accordingly ; still lesswas it the sullen belief of the fanatic in destiny ; it was thatfaith in the absurd, which necessarily makes its appearancein every man who has thoroughly ceased to believe in a con­nected order of things—the superstition of the fortunateplayer, who deems himself privileged by fate to throw oneach and every occasion the right number. In practicalmatters Sulla understood very well how to satisfy ironicallythe demands of religion. When he emptied the treasuries ofthe Greek temples, he declared that the man could neverfail whose chest was replenished by the gods themselves.When the Delphic priests reported to him that they wereafraid to send the treasures which he asked, because theharp of the god emitted a clear sound when they touchedit, he returned the reply that they might now send themall the more readily, as the god evidently approved hisdesigns. Nevertheless he fondly flattered himself with theidea that he was the chosen favourite of the gods, and in analtogether special manner of the goddess to whom down tohis latest years he assigned the pre-eminence, Aphrodite. Inhis conversations as well as in his autobiography he oftenplumed himself on the intercourse which the immortalsheld with him in dreams and omens. He had more rightthan most men to be proud of his achievements; he wasnot so, but he was proud of his uniquely faithful fortune.He was wont to say that every improvised enterprise turnedout better with him than those which were systematicallyplanned; and one of his strangest whims—that of regularlystating the number of those who had fallen on his side in battleas nil—was nothing but the childishness of a child of fortune.It was but the utterance of his natural disposition, when,having reached the culminating point of his career andseeing all his contemporaries at a dizzy depth beneath him,he assumed the designation of the Fortunate—Sulla Felix—as a formal surname, and bestowed corresponding appel­lations on his children.

the exercises in the Greek literature and language, was amatter of course; and the scholars also consisted, as at theseexercises, of youths, and not of boys. This Latin instructionwas soon divided like the Greek into two courses; in so faras the Latin literature was first scientifically prelected on,and then a technical introduction was given to the prepa­ration of panegyrics, public, and forensic orations. Thefirst Roman school of literature was opened about Stilo'stime by Marcus Saevius Nicanor Postumus, the first separateschool for Latin rhetoric about 660 by Lucius Plotius 90.Gallus; but ordinarily instructions in rhetoric were alsogiven in the Latin schools of literature. This new Latinschool-instruction was of the most comprehensive import­ance. The introduction to the knowledge of Latin literatureand Latin oratory, such as had formerly been imparted byconnoisseurs and masters of high position, had preserved acertain independence in relation to the Greeks. The criticsof language and the masters of oratory were indeed underthe influence of Hellenism, but not absolutely under that ofthe Greek school-grammar and school-rhetoric; the latterin particular was decidedly an object of dread. The prideas well as the sound common sense of the Romans revoltedagainst the Greek assertion, that the ability to speak of things,which the orator understood and felt, intelligibly and attrac­tively to his peers in the mother-tongue could be learned inthe school by school-rules. To the solid practical advocatethe procedure of the Greek rhetoricians, so totally estrangedfrom life, could not but appear worse for the beginner thanno preparation at all; to the man of thorough culture andmatured experience the Greek rhetoric seemed shallow andrepulsive; while the man of serious conservative views didnot fail to observe the close affinity between a professionallydeveloped rhetoric and the trade of the demagogue. Accord­ingly the Seipionic circle had shown the most bitter hosti­lity to the rhetoricians, and, if Greek declamations beforepaid masters were tolerated primarily perhaps as exercisesin speaking Greek, Greek rhetoric did not thereby find itsway either into Latin oratory or into Latin oratorical in­struction. But in the new Latin rhetorical schools theRoman youths were trained as men and public orators bydiscussing in pairs rhetorical themes; they accused or onthe other hand defended Ulysses, who was found besidethe corpse of Ajax with the latter's bloody sword, of the

intended to have his consulship annually renewed, likethe tribunate of Gracchus. But, amidst the agreement ofthe political positions marked out for the younger Gracchusand for Marius in all other essential particulars, there wasyet a very material distinction between the land-assigningtribune and the land-assigning consul in the fact, that theformer was to occupy a purely civil position, the latter amilitary position as well; a distinction, which partly but byno means solely arose out of the personal circumstancesunder which the two men had risen to the head of thestate.
While such was the nature of the aim which Marius andhis comrades had proposed to themselves, the next questionrelated to the means by which they purposed to break downthe resistance, that might be anticipated to be obstinate, ofthe government party. Gaius Gracchus had fought hisbattles with the aid of the capitalist class and the proletariate.His successors did not neglect to make advances likewise tothese. The equites were not only left in possession of thetribunals, but their power as jurymen was considerably in­creased, partly by a stricter ordinance regarding the standingcommission—especially important to the merchants—as toextortions on the part of the public magistrates in the pro­vinces, which Glaucia carried probably in this year, partly103. by the special tribunal, appointed perhaps as early as 651 onthe proposal of Saturninus, respecting the embezzlementsand other official malversations that had occurred during theCimbrian commotion in Gaul. For the benefit, moreover,of the proletariate of the capital the sum below cost price,which hitherto had to be paid on occasion of the distribu­tions of grain for the modius, was lowered from 6$ asses to amere nominal charge of J of an as. But, although they didnot despise the alliance with the equites and the proletariateof the capital, the real power by which the confederatesmainly enforced their measures lay not in these, but in thedischarged soldiers of the Marian army, who for that veryreason had been provided for in the colonial laws themselvesafter so extravagant a fashion. In this respect also the pre­eminently military character was conspicuous, which formsthe chief distinction between this attempt at revolution andthat which preceded it.Violent in- They went to work accordingly.

In Campanianot only was the democratic colony of Capua done away andits domain given back to the state, as was naturally to beexpected, but the island of JSnaria (Ischia) was also, pro­bably about this time, withdrawn from the community ofNeapolis. In Latium the whole territory of the large andwealthy city of Praeneste and probably of Norba also wasconfiscated, as was likewise that of Spoletium in Umbria.Sulmo in the Paelignian district was even razed. But theiron arm of the regent fell with especial weight on the tworegions, which had offered a serious resistance up to the endand even after the battle at the Colline gate—Etruria andSamnium. There a number of the most considerable com­munes, such as Florentia, Faesulae, Arretium, Volaterrae,were visited with total confiscation. Of the fate of Samniumwe have already spoken; there was no confiscation there,but the land was laid waste for ever, its flourishing towns,even the former Latin colony of JEsernia, were left in ruins,and the country was placed on the same footing with theBruttian and Lucanian regions.Assigna- These arrangements as to the property of the Italian soil

He appointed Arschagan viceroy ofPersia and his son Dicran (Tigranes) viceroy of Armenia, and gave hisdaughter Ardaschama in marriage to the great prince of the Iberians Mihrdates(Mithradates) who was descended from Mihrdates satrap of Darius and go­vernor appointed by Alexander over the conquered Iberians, and ruled in thenorthern mountains as well as over the Black Sea. Ardasches then tookCroesus the king of the Lydians prisoner, subdued the mainland between thetwo great seas (Asia Minor), and crossed the sea with innumerable vessels tosubjugate the West. As there was anarchy at that time in Rome, he nowhereencountered serious resistance, but his soldiers killed each other and Ardaschesfell by the hands of his own troops. After Ardasches' death his successor Die*ran marched against the army of the Greeks (»'. e. the Romans) who now inturn invaded the Armenian land; he set a limit to their advance, handed overto his brother-in-law Mihrdates the administration of Madschag (Mazaka inCappadocia) and of the interior along with a considerable force, and returned toArmenia. Many years afterwards there were still pointed out in the Arme­nian towns statues of Greek gods by well-known masters, trophies of this cam­paign.

In just the same way the victory over Crassus is afterwards attri­buted to the Armenians. These Oriental accounts are to be received with allthe greater caution, that they are by no means mere popular legends; on thecontrary the accounts of Josephus, Eusebius, and other authorities currentamong the Christians of the fifth century have been amalgamated with the Ar­menian traditions, and the historical romances of the Greeks and beyond doubtthe patriotic fancies also of Moses himself have been laid to a considerable ex­tent under contribution. Bad as is our Occidental tradition in itself, to call inthe aid of Oriental tradition in this and similar cases—as has been attemptedfor instance by the uncritical Saint-Martin—can only lead to still further coo-fusion.

The districts of Italy, which hadhitherto preserved their old language and manners, Etruriaand Samnium, were not only visited by the heaviest blowsof the Sullan reaction, but were compelled also by thepolitical levelling of Italy to adopt the Latin language andcustoms in public intercourse, so that the old native lan­guages were reduced to popular dialects which soon decayed.There no longer appears throughout the bounds of theRoman state any nationality entitled even to compete withthe Roman and the Greek.

Yet the bitter lesson seemed utterly lost on the successorof Mancinus, his colleague in the consulship, MarcusJEmilius Lepidus. While the discussions as to the treatywith Mancinus were pending in Rome, he attacked the freenation of the Vaccaei under frivolous pretexts just asLucullus had done sixteen years before, and began inconcert with the general of the Further province to besiege136. Pallantia (618). A decree of the senate enjoined him todesist from the war; nevertheless, under the pretext thatthe circumstances had changed in the mean time, he con­tinued the siege. In doing so he showed himself as bada soldier as he was a bad citizen. After lying so longbefore the large and strong city that his supplies in thatrugged and hostile country failed, he was obliged to leavebehind all the sick and wounded and to undertake aretreat, in which the pursuing Pallantines destroyed halfof his soldiers, and, if they had not broken off the pur­suit too early, would probably have utterly annihilated theRoman army, which was already in full course of dissolution.For this fault a fine was imposed on the highborn generalat his return. His successors Lucius Furius Philus136. 135.

The pecuniary re­sources for carrying on the war were indeed doled out tohim with preposterous parsimony, and the permission to levysoldiers which he asked was even directly refused—a circum­stance due, probably, to coterie-intrigues and to the fearof being burdensome to the sovereign people. But a greatnumber of friends and clients voluntarily accompanied him;among them was his brother Maximus lEmilianus, who someyears before had commanded with distinction against Viria-thus.

In these quarterskingdoms might be formed out of the inland countries situatedbeyond the limits of the Roman hegemony without Bomebeing able very directly or speedily to prevent them, and,in antagonism to the weak states under Roman protection,might develop a power dangerous to Rome and enteringsooner or later into rivalry with her. No doubt the con­dition of the bordering nations—everywhere split into frag­ments and nowhere favourable to political development ona great scale—formed some sort of protection against thisdanger; yet we very clearly perceive in the history of theEast, that at this period the Euphrates was no longerguarded by the phalanx of Seleucus and was not yet watchedby the legions of Augustus.
It was high time to put an end to this uncertain stateof things. But the only possible way of ending it was byconverting the client states into Roman provinces. Thiscould be done all the more easily, that the Roman provin­cial constitution in fact only concentrated military powerin the hands of the Roman governor, while administra­tion and jurisdiction in the main were, or at any rate wereintended to be, retained by the communities, so that asmuch of the old political independence as was at all capableof life might he preserved in the form of communal freedom.The necessity for this administrative reform could not wellbe mistaken; the only question was, whether the senatewould put it off and mar it, or whether it would have thecourage and the power clearly to discern and energeticallyto execute what was needful.Carthage Let us first glance at Africa.

Heacquiesced in or even favoured the report, that persons ofdistinction aided him in composing with their counsel or evenwith their co-operation.* In reality he carried his point;even in literature the oligarchy prevailed, and the artisticcomedy of the exclusives supplanted the comedy of thepeople: we find that about 620 the pieces of Plautus dis- 134.appeared from the set of stock plays. This is the more sig­nificant, because after the early death of Terence no man ofconspicuous talent at all further occupied this field. Kespect-ing the comedies of Turpilius (+651 at an advanced age) 103.and other stop-gaps wholly or almost wholly forgotten, aconnoisseur already at the close of this period gave it as hisopinion, that the new comedies were even much worse thanthe bad new pennies (P. 413).
We have formerly shown (ii. 443) that a national Roman Nationalcomedy (togata) was added to the GraecO-Roman (palliatd) comedy.


* In the prologue of the Heauiontimorumenos he puts the objection into themouth of his censors :—

And in the later prologue (594) to the Adelphi he says— 160.

As early as the time of Cicero it was the general supposition that La;lius andScipio iEmilianus were here meant: the scenes were designated which werealleged to proceed from them; stories were told of the journeys of the poorpoet with his noble patrons to their estates near Rome ; and it was reckoned un­pardonable that they had done nothing at all for the improvement of his financialcircumstances. But the power which creates legend is, as is well known, no­where more potent than in the history of literature. It is clear, and evenjudicious Roman critics acknowledged, that these lines could not possibly applyto Scipio who was then twenty-five years of age, and to his friend Laelius whowas not much older. Others with at least more judgment thought of the noblepoets Quintus Labeo (consul in 571) and Marcus Popillius (consul in 581), 183. 173.and of the learned patron of art and mathematician, Lucius Sulpicius Gallus(consul in 588); but this too is evidently mere conjecture. That Terence was 166.in close relations with the Scipionic house cannot, however, be doubted: it isa significant fact, that the first exhibition of the Adelphi and the second of theffecura took place at the funeral games of Lucius l'aullus, whicii were pro.vided by his sons Scipio and Fabius.

faults, by his unaristocratic disinterestedness no less than byhis boorish uncouthness; he was called by the multitude athird Eomulus and a second Camillus; libations were pouredforth to him like the gods. It was no wonder, that the headof the peasant's son grew giddy at times with all this glory;that he compared his march from Africa to Gaul to the vic­torious processions of Dionysus from continent to continent,and had a cup—none of the smallest—manufactured for hisuse after the model of that of Bacchus. There was just asmuch of hope as of gratitude in that delirious enthusiasm ofthe people, which might have led astray a man of colderblood and more mature political experience. The work ofMarius seemed to his admirers by no means finished. Thewretched government oppressed the land more heavily thanthe barbarians: on him, the first man of Rome, the favouriteof the people, the head of the opposition, devolved the taskof once more delivering Rome. It is true that to one who wasa rustic and a soldier the political proceedings of the capitalwere strange and iucongruous: he spoke as ill as he commandedwell, and displayed a far firmer bearing in presence of thelances and swords of the enemy than in presence of the ap­plause or hisses of the multitude; but his inclinations Wereof little moment. The hopes of which he was the object con­strained him. His military and political position was suchthat, if he would not break with his glorious past, if he wouldnot deceive the expectations of his party and in fact of thenation, if he would not be unfaithful to his own sense of duty,he must check the maladministration of public affairs and putan end to the government of the restoration; and if h'e onlypossessed the internal qualities of a head of the people, hemight certainly dispense with those which he wanted as apopular leader.
He held in his hand a formidable weapon in the newly The neworganized army. Previously to his time the fundamental militaryprinciple of the Servian constitution—by which the levy was "fg3111211-limited entirely to the burgesses possessed of property, and lon'the distinctions in equipment were regulated solely by theproperty qualification (i. 95, 316)—had necessarily been invarious respects relaxed. The minimum census of 11,000asses (£115), which bound its possessor to enter the burgess-army, had been lowered to 4000 (£41; ii. 352).

Outer wall ...... 2 metres = 6J feet.

Casemate rooms .... 4'2 „ = 14 „

Whole breadth of the walls . . 10'1 metres = 33 feet.
Or, as Diodorus (p. 522) states it, 22 cubits (1 Greek cubit = 1} feet), whileLivy (ap. Oros. iv. 22) and Appian (Pun. 95), who seem to hare had beforethem another less accurate passage of Polybius, state the breadth of the wallsat 30 feet. The triple wall of Appian—as to which a false idea has hithertobeen diffused by Florus (i. 31)—denotes the outer wall, and the front andback walls of the casemates. That this coincidence is not accidental, and thatwe have here in reality the remains of the famed walls of Carthage beforeus, will be evident to every one: the objections of Davis (Carthage and Her,Remains, p. 370 et seq.) only show how little even the utmost zeal can adduce,in opposition to the main results of Beule^. Only we must maintain that all theancient authorities give the statements of which we are now speaking; with re­ference not to the citadel-wall, but to the city-wall on the landward side, of whichthe wall along the south side of the citadel hill was an integral part (Oros. iv. 22).In accordance with this view, the excavations at the citadel hill on the east,north, and west, have shown no traces of fortifications, whereas on the southside they have brought to light the very remains of this great wall. There isno reason for regarding these as the remains of a separate fortification of thecitadel distinct from the city wall; it may be presumed that further excava­tions at a corresponding depth (the foundation of the city wall discovered atthe Byrsa lies fifty-six feet beneath the present surface) will bring to light like,or at any rate analogous, foundations along the whole landward side, althoughit is probable that at the point where the walled suburb of Magalia adjoinedthe main wall the fortification was either weaker from the first or was earlyneglected. The length of the wall as a whole cannot be stated with precision;but it must have been very considerable, for three hundred elephants werestabled there, and the stores for their fodder and perhaps other spaces also aswell as the gates are to be taken into account. It was very natural that theinner city, within whose walls the Byrsa was included, should, especially byway of contrast to the suburb of Magalia which had its separate circumval-lation, be sometimes itself called Byrsa (App. Pun. 117; Nepos, ap. Serv.JEn. i. 368).
\ Such is the height given by Appian, I. c.; Diodorus gives the height, pro­bably inclusive of the battlements, at 40 cubits or 60 feet. The remnantpreserved is still from 13 to 16 feet (4—5 metres) high.

Cbaeronea; all northern Greece was evacuated, and only asmall portion of the Achaean army and of the citizens ofThebes, who fled in a body, reached the Peloponnesus. Metel-lus sought by the utmost moderation to induce the Greeks toabandon their foolish resistance, and gave orders, for ex­ample, that all the Thebans, with a single exception, shouldbe allowed their liberty; his well-meant endeavours werethwarted not by the energy of the people, but by thedesperation of the leaders apprehensive for their own safety.Diaeus, who after the fall of Critolaus had resumed the chiefcommand, summoned all men capable of bearing arms tothe isthmus, and ordered 12,000 slaves, natives of Greece,to be enrolled in the army; the rich were applied to foradvances, and the ranks of the friends of peace, so far asthey did not purchase their lives by bribing their tyrannicalmasters, were thinned by bloody prosecutions. The waraccordingly was continued, and after the same style. TheAchaean vanguard, which, 4000 strong, was stationed underAlcamenes at Megara, dispersed as soon as it saw theRoman standards. Metellus was just about to order anattack upon the main force on the isthmus, when the consulLucius Mummius with a few attendants arrived at theRoman head-quarters and took the command. Meanwhilethe Achaeans, emboldened by a successful attack on the toounguarded Roman outposts, offered battle to the Romanarmy, which was about twice as strong, at Leucopetra on theisthmus. The Romans were not slow to accept it. Atthe very first the Achaean horsemen broke off en masse beforethe Roman cavalry of six times their strengh; the hopliteswithstood the enemy till a flank attack by the Romanselect corps brought confusion into their ranks.

among them. The consequences of neglecting theory ap­peared practically in the low state of medical knowledge andJurispru- of a portion of the military sciences. Of all the professionaldence. sciences jurisprudence alone was flourishing-. We cannottrace its internal development with chronological accuracy.On the whole the pontifical law fell more and more into theshade, and at the end of this period stood nearly in the sameposition as the canon law at the present day. The finer andmore profound conception of law, on the other hand, whichsubstitutes for outward criteria the motive springs of actionwithin—such as the development of the ideas of offences aris­ing from intention and from carelessness respectively, and ofpossession entitled to temporary protection—was not yet inexistence at the time of the Twelve Tables, but was so in theage of Cicero, and probably owed its elaboration substantiallyto the present epoch. The reaction of political relations onthe development of law has been already indicated on severaloccasions; it was not always advantageous. By the insti­tution of the tribunal of the Centumviri to deal with inherit­ance (P. 372), for instance, there was introduced in the lawof property a college of jurymen, which, like the criminal au­thorities, instead of simply applying the law placed itselfabove it and with its so-called equity undermined the legalinstitutions; one consequence of which among others was theirrational principle, that any one whom a relative had passedover in his testament was at liberty to propose that thetestament should be annulled by the court, and the courtdecided according to its discretion. The development ofjuristic literature admits of being more distinctly recognized.It had hitherto been restricted to collections of formula­ries and explanations of terms in the laws; at this periodthere was first formed a literature of opinions {responsa),which answers nearly to our modern collections of prece­dents. These opinions—which were delivered no longermerely by members of the pontifical college but by every onewho found persons to consult him, at home or in the openmarket-place, and with which were already associatedrational and polemical illustrations and the standing con­troversies peculiar to jurisprudence—began to be noteddown and to be promulgated in collections about the begin­ning of the seventh century.

importance are placed beyond doubt by their results—themurder of the praetor by a band of creditors (P. 258), theattempt to eject from the senate all the senators not free ofdebt (P. 259), the renewal of the maximum of interest bySulla (P. 267), the annulling of 75 per cent, of all debtsby the revolutionary party (P. 325). The consequence of this Miiture ofsystem was naturally general impoverishment and depopula- the Dations.tion in the provinces, whereas the parasitic population ofmigratory or temporarily settled Italians was everywhere onthe increase. In Asia Minor 80,000 men of Italian origin Italiansare said to have perished in one day ( P. 294). How numerous abroad,they were in Delos, is evident from the tombstones stillextant on the island and from the statement that ^0,000foreigners, mostly Italian merchants, were put to deaththere by command of Mithradates (P. 297). In Africa theItalians were so many, that even the Numidian city ofCirta was chiefly defended by them against Jugurtha (P. 147).Gaul too, it is said, was filled with Roman merchants; inthe case of Spain alone—perhaps not accidentally—no state­ments of this sort are found. In Italy itself on the otherhand the condition of the free population at this epoch hadon the whole beyond doubt retrograded. To this resultcertainly the civil wars essentially contributed, which, accord­ing to statements of a general kind and but little reliable,are alleged to have swept away frum 100,000 to 150,000 ofthe Roman burgesses and 300,000 of the Italian populationgenerally; but still worse was the effect of the economic ruinof the middle class and of the boundless extent of the mercan­tile emigration, which induced a great portion of the Italianyouth to spend their most vigorous years abroad. A com- Foreignerspensation of very dubious value was afforded by the free in Italy,parasitic Hellenico-Oriental population, which sojourned inthe capital as diplomatic agents for kings or communities,as physicians, schoolmasters, priests, servants, parasites,and in the myriad employments of sharpers and swindlers, oras traders and mariners frequented especially Ostia, Pu-teoli, and Brundisium.

But this vigour had its limit. The Italian domain-land Its suspen-was not exclusively in the hands of Roman burgesses ; large sion bytracts of it had been assigned in exclusive usufruct to par- »ip!?ticular allied communities by decrees of the people or senate,and other portions had been occupied with or without per­mission by Latin burgesses. The triumvirs at lengthattacked these possessions. The resumption of the portionssimply occupied by non-burgesses was no doubt allowable informal law, and not less in all probability the resumption ofthe domain-land handed over by decrees of the senate oreven by state-treaties to the Italian communities, since thestate in so doing by no means renounced its ownership, andto all appearance gave its grants to communities, just asto private persons, subject to revocation. But the complaintsof these allied or subject communities, that Rome did notkeep the treaties concluded with them, could not be simplydisregarded like the complaints of the Roman citizens in­jured by the acts of the commissioners. Legally the formermight be no better founded than the latter; but, while inthe latter case the matter at stake was the private interestsof members of the state, in reference to the Latin posses­sions the question arose, whether it was politically right togive fresh offence to communities so important in a militarypoint of view and already so greatly estranged from Romeby numerous disabilities de jure and de facto (ii. 333 et seq..)through this sore injury to their material interests. The de­cision lay in the hands of the middle party ; it was that partywhich after the fall of Gracchus had, in league with hisadherents, protected reform against the oligarchy, and italone w'as now able in concert with the oligarchy to set alimit to reform.

(between the rivers Ombrone and Albegna);the second led by Sulla in person fell in with the army ofCarbo in the valley of the Clanis, and after a successfulconflict with his Spanish cavalry fought a pitched battlewith himself in the region of Chiusi. It ended withoutbeing properly decisive, but so far, at any rate, in favour ofCarbo that Sulla's victorious advance was checked.
In the vicinity of Rome also events appeared to assumea more favourable turn for the revolutionary party, and thewar seemed as if it would again be attracted chiefly towardsthis region. For, while the oligarchic party were concen­trating all their energies on Etruria, the democracy every­where put forth the utmost efforts to break the blockadeof Praeneste.

Help in earnest on the other handcame from Southern Italy.

It was natural that they should do so; their interests andaims coincided, and even in the earlier candidatures ofMarius Saturninus at least had most decidedly and mosteffectively taken his side. It was agreed between them, that
100. for 654 Marius should become a candidate for a sixth con­sulship, Saturninus for a second tribunate, Glaucia for thepraetorship, in order that, possessed of these offices, theymight carry out the intended revolution in the state. Thesenate acquiesced in the nomination of the less dangerousGlaucia, but did what it could to hinder the election ofMarius and Saturninus, or at least to associate with theformer a determined antagonist in the person of QuintusMetellus as his colleague in the consulship. All appliances,lawful and unlawful, were put in motion by both parties;but the senate was not successful in arresting the dangerousconspiracy in the bud. Marius did not disdain in person tosolicit votes and, it was said, even to purchase them; infact, at the tribunician elections when nine men from thelist of the government-party were proclaimed, and the tenthplace seemed already secured for a respectable man of thesame complexion Quintus Nunnius, the latter was set uponand slain by a savage band, which is said to have beenmainly composed of discharged soldiers of Marius.

In alliance with the Helvetii, the Cimbrihad without difficulty passed from the Seine to the region ofthe sources of the Rhine, had crossed the chain of the Alpsby the Brenner pass, and had descended thence through thevalleys of the Eisach and Adige into the Italian plain.Here the consul Quintus Lutatius Catulus was to guard thepasses; but not fully acquainted with the country andafraid of having his flank turned, he had not ventured to ad­vance into the Alps, but had posted himself below Trent onthe left bank of the Adige, and had secured in any event hisretreat to the right bank by the construction of a bridge.When the Cimbrians, however, pushed forward in densemasses from the mountains, a panic seized the Roman army,and legionaries and horsemen ran off, the latter straight forthe capital, the former to the nearest height which seemedto yield security. With great difficulty Catulus brought atleast the greater portion of his army by a stratagem back tothe river and over the bridge, before the enemy, who com­manded the upper course of the Adige and were alreadyfloating down trees and beams against the bridge, succeededin destroying it and thereby cutting off the retreat of thearmy. But the general had to leave behind a legion on theother bank, and the cowardly tribune who led it was alreadydisposed to capitulate, when the centurion Gnaeus Petreiusof Atina struck him down and cut his way through themidst of the enemy to the main army on the right bank ofthe Adige. Thus the army, and in some degree even thehonour of their arms, was saved; but the consequences ofthe neglect to occupy the passes and of the too hasty retreatwere yet very seriously felt. Catulus was obliged to with­draw to the right bank of the Po and to leave the wholeplain between the Po and the Alps in the power of the Cim­bri, so that communication was maintained with Aquileia102. only by sea. This took place in the summer of 652, aboutthe same time when the decisive battle between the Teutonesand the Bomans occurred at Aquae Sextiae.

He himself seemed to feel it. His days werepassed as in delirium, and by night his couch denied himrest, so that he grasped the wine cup in order merely todrown thought. A burning fever seized him; after beingstretched for seven days on a sick bed, in the wild fanciesof which he was fighting on the fields of Asia Minor thebattles whose laurels were destined for Sulla, he expired onDeath [86. the 13th Jan. 668. He died, more than seventy years old,of Marins. in full possession of what he called power and honour,and in his bed; but Nemesis assumes various shapes, anddoes not always expiate blood with blood. Was there nosort of retaliation in the fact, that Rome and Italy nowbreathed more freely on the news of the death of the famousdeliverer of the people than at the tidings of the battle onthe Raudine plain?
Even after his death individual incidents no doubt occurred,which recalled that time of terror; Gaius Fimbria, for in­stance, who more than any other during the Marian butcherieshad dipped his hand in blood, made an attempt at the veryfuneral of Marius to kill the universally revered pontifex mari-95. mus Quintus Scaevola (consul in 659) who had been sparedeven by Marius, and then, when the pontifex recoveredfrom the wound he had received, indicted him criminallyon account of the offence, as Fimbria jestingly expressed it.of having not been willing to let himself be murdered.

Along with the reign of terror came the tyrannis. Cinna Govern-not only stood at the head of the state for four years in »»' ofsuccession (667-670) as consul, but he regularly nominated Cl°"^himself and his colleagues without consulting the people;it seemed as if these democrats set aside the sovereignpopular assembly with intentional contempt. No otherchief of the popular party, before or afterwards, possessed soperfectly absolute a power in Italy and in the greater partof the provinces for so long a time almost undisturbed asCinna; but no one can be named, whose government wasso utterly worthless and aimless. The law proposed bySulpicius and thereafter by Cinna himself, which promisedto the new burgesses and the freedmen equality of suffragewith the old burgesses, was naturally revived; and it wasformally confirmed by a decree of the senate as valid in law(670). Censors were nominated (668) for the purpose of 8i. SGdistributing all the Italians, in accordance with it, into thethirty-five tribes; by a singular conjuncture, in consequenceof a want of qualified candidates for the censorship the samePhilippus, who when consul in 663 had been the principal 9t.occasion of the miscarriage of Drusus' plan for bestowingthe franchise on the Italians (P. 221), was now selected ascensor to inscribe them in the burgess-rolls. The reac­tionary institutions established by Sulla in 666 were of 88.course overthrown. Some steps were taken to please theproletariate—for instance, the restrictions on the distribu­tion of grain introduced some years ago (P. 237), wereprobably now once more removed; the design of GaiusGracchus to found a colony at Capua was in reality carriedout in the spring of 671 on the proposal of the tribune of 83.the people, Marcus Junius Brutus; Lucius Valerius Flaccusthe younger introduced a law as to debt, which reducedevery private claim to the fourth part of its nominal amountand cancelled three-fourths in favour of the debtors. Butthese measures, the only positive ones during the wholeCinnan government, were without exception the dictates ofthe moment; they were based—and this is perhaps the mostshocking feature in this whole catastrophe—not on a planpossibly erroneous, but on no political plan at all.

But while the war stood still in Etruria and in Latium, Successes otmatters came to a decision in the valley of the Po. There the Sultansthe general of the democracy, Gaius Norbanus, had hitherto ia uPPermaintained the ascendancy, had attacked Marcus Lucullus y'the legate of Metellus with superior force and compelledhim to shut himself up in Placentia, and had at lengthturned against Metellus in person. He encountered thelatter at Faventia, and immediately made his attack late inthe afternoon with his troops fatigued by their march; theconsequence was a complete defeat and the total breakingup of his corps, of which only about 1000 men returned toEtruria. On the news of this battle Lucullus sallied fromPlacentia, and defeated the division left behind to opposehim at Fidentia (between Piacenza and Parma). TheLucanian troops of Albinovanus deserted in a body: theirleader made up for his hesitation at first by inviting thechief officers of the revolutionary army to banquet withhim and causing them to be put to death; in generalevery one, who could do so, now concluded his peace.Ariminum with all its stores and treasures fell into thepower of Metellus; Norbanus embarked for Rhodes; thewhole land between the Alps and Apennines acknowledgedthe government of the Optimates. The troops hitherto Etruria ix>employed there were enabled to proceed to the attack of cupied byEtruria, the last province where their antagonists still keptthe Sullan*.the field. When Carbo received this news in the camp atClusium, he lost his resolution; although he had still a con­siderable body of troops under his orders, he secretlyescaped from his headquarters and embarked for Africa.Part of his abandoned troops followed the example whichtheir general had set, and went home; part of them weredestroyed by Pompeius: Carrinas gathered together theremainder and led them to Latium to join the army ofPraeneste. There no change had in the meanwhile takenplace; and the final dscision drew nigh. The troops ofCarrinas were not numerous enough to shake Sulla's posi­tion; the vanguard of the army of the oligarchical party,hitherto employed in Etruria, was approaching under Pom­peius : in a few days the net would be drawn tight aroundthe army of the democrats and the Sainnites.

The authors ofthat deed were the marines, from of old the least respect­able of the troops. A division of legionaries raised chieflyfrom the city populace soon followed the example thusgiven. Instigated by Gaius Titius, one of the heroes of themarket-place, it laid hands on the consul Cato. By an acci­dent he escaped death on this occasion; Titius was arrested,but was not punished. .When Cato soon afterwards actuallyperished in a combat, his own officers, and particularly theyounger Gaius Marius, were—whether justly or unjustlycannot be ascertained—designated as the authors of hisdeath.Economic To the political and military crisis thus beginning fell tocrisis. be added the economic crisis—perhaps still more terrible—
which set in upon the Roman capitalists in consequence ofthe Social war and the Asiatic troubles. The debtors,unable even to raise the interest due and yet inexorablypressed by their creditors, had on the one hand entreatedfrom the proper judicial authority, the urban praetor Asellio,a respite to enable them to dispose of their possessions,and on the other hand had searched out once more theold obsolete laws as to usury (i. 311) and, in accordancewith the rule established in olden times, had sued theircreditors for fourfold the amount of the interest paid tothem contrary to the law. Asellio applied himself to bendthe de facto existing law to the letter, and sanctioned in theusual way the desired actions for interest; whereupon theoffended creditors assembled in the Forum under the leader­ship of the tribune of the people Lucius Cassius, and at-Murderof tacked and killed the praetor in front of the temple ofAsellio.

seemed superfluous to guard their own honour. In likemanner not only was Cyprus retained by Egypt in spite ofthe decree of the senate to the contrary, but, when after the146. death of Philometer (608) Euergetes succeeded him andso reunited the divided kingdom, the senate allowed thisalso to take place without opposition.
After such occurrences the Roman influence in thesecountries was practically destroyed, and events pursuedtheir course there for the present without the help of theRomans; but it is necessary for the right understandingof the sequel that we should not wholly omit to notice thehistory of the nearer, and even of the remoter, East. Whilein Egypt, shut off as it is on all sides, the existing state ofthings did not so easily admit of change, in Asia both to the westand east of the Euphrates the peoples and states underwentessential modifications during, and partly in consequenceof, this temporary suspension of the Roman superintendence.Beyond the great desert of Iran there had arisen not longafter Alexander the Great the kingdom of Palimbothraunder Chandragupta (Sandracottus) on the Indus, and thepowerful Bactrian state on the upper Oxus, both formed froma mixture of national elements with the most eastern offshootsof Hellenic civilization. To the west of these began thekingdom of Asia, which, although diminished under Autio-ehus the Great, still stretched its unwieldy bulk from theHellespont to the Median and Persian provinces, and em­braced the whole basin of the Euphrates and Tigris. Thatking had still carried his arms beyond the desert into theterritory of the Parthians and Bactrians; it was only underhim that the vast state had begun to melt away. Notonly had western Asia been lost in consequence of thebattle of Magnesia; the total emancipation of the twoCappadocias and the two Armenias—Armenia proper inthe north-east and' the region of Sophene in the south­west—and their conversion from principalities dependent onSyria into independent kingdoms, also belong to this period(ii. 273). Of these states Great Armenia in particular,under the Artaxiads, soon attained to a considerableposition. "Wounds perhaps still more dangerous wereinflicted on the empire by the foolish levelling policy of175-164. his successor Antiochus Epiphanes (579-590).

even by way of advance—after the war with Perseus nofurther tax was asked from the community. They preferredto allow their military system to decay, rather than to com­pel the burgesses to enter the odious transmarine service; howit fared with the individual magistrates who attempted tocarry out the conscription according to the strict letter ofthe law, has already been related (P. 69).
In the Rome of this epoch the two evils of a degenerateoligarchy and a democracy not yet developed but alreadycankered in the bud were interwoven in a manner pregnantwith fatal results. According to their party names, whichwere first heard during this period, the " Optimates " wished togive effect to the will of the best, the " Populares" to that ofthe community; but in fact there was in the Rome of thatday neither a true aristocracy nor a truly self-determiningcommunity. Both parties contended alike for shadows, andnumbered in their ranks none but enthusiasts or hypocrites.Both were equally affected by political corruption, and bothwere in fact equally worthless. Both were necessarily tieddown to the status quo, for neither on the one side nor on theother was there any political idea—to say nothing of any poli­tical plan—rising above the existing state of things; and ac­cordingly the two parties were so entirely in agreement, thatthey met at every step as respected both means and ends, anda change of party was a change of political tactics morethan of political sentiments. The commonwealth wouldbeyond doubt have been a gainer, if either the aristocracyhad directly introduced a hereditary rotation instead of elec­tion by the burgesses, or the democracy had produced fromwithin it a real democratic government. But these Optimatesand these Populares of the beginning of the seventh centurylAC-were far too indispensable for each other to wage such in­ternecine war; they not only could not destroy each other,but, even if they had been able to do so, they would nothave been willing. Meanwhile the commonwealth was poli­tically and morally more and more unhinged, and was vergingtowards its total dissolution.
The crisis with which the Roman revolution was openedarose not out of this paltry political conflict, but out of theeconomic and social relations which the Roman governmentallowed, like everything else, simply to take their course,and which thus found opportunity to bring the morbidmatter, that had been long fermenting, without hindrance

was quite clear: numerous persons unfriendly for reasonsgood or bad to the government, and especially the justlyindignant mercantile order, desired nothing better than suchan opportunity of annoying the aristocracy in its mostsensitive point: he was elected to the consulship by anenormous majority, and not only so, but while, in other casesby the law of Gaius Gracchus the duty of determining thefunctions to be assigned to the consuls lay with the senate(P. 118), he was exceptionally invested by decree of thepeople with the supreme command in the African war.
Accordingly he succeeded Metellus in 648; but his con 106.fident promise to do better than his predecessor and to Conflictsdeliver Jugurtha bound hand and foot with all speed at w,,11"utRome was more easily given than fulfilled. Marius carriedon a desultory warfare with the Gaetulians; he reducedseveral towns that had not previously been occupied; heundertook an expedition to Capsa which surpassed eventhat of Thala in difficulty, took the town by capitulation,and in spite of the convention caused all the adult men init to be slain—the only means, no doubt, of preventing therenewed revolt of that remote city of the desert; he attackeda mountain-stronghold—situated on the river Molochath,which separated the Numidian territory from the Maure-tanian—whither Jugurtha had removed his treasure-chest,and, just as he was about to desist from the siege in despairof success, fortunately gained possession of the impregnablefastness through the coup de main of some daring climbers.Had his object merely been to harden the army by boldrazzias and to procure booty for the soldiers, or even toeclipse Metellus' march into the desert by an expeditiongoing still further, this method of warfare might be allowedto pass unchallenged; but the main object to be aimed at,and which Metellus had steadfastly and perseveringly keptin view—the capture of Jugurtha—was in this way utterlyset aside. The expedition of Marius to Capsa was an ad­venture as aimless, as that of Metellus to Thala had beenjudicious; but the expedition to the Molochath, whichpassed along the border of, if not into, the Mauretanianterritory, was directly repugnant to sound policy. KingBocchus, in whose power it lay to bring the war to an issuefavourable for the Romans or endlessly to prolong it, nowconcluded with Jugurtha a treaty, in which the latter cededto him a part of his kingdom and Bocchus promised actively

The thirty companies (manipuli) of heavy infantry,which—each in two sections (centurke) composed respectivelyof sixty men in the two first, and of thirty men in the third,division—had hitherto formed the tactical unit, were replacedbv ten cohorts (cohortes) each with its own standard and eachof six, or often only of five, sections of one hundred menapiece; so that, although at the same time 1200 men weresaved by the suppression of the light infantry of the legion,yet the total numbers of the legion were raised from 4200to 6000 men. The custom of fighting in three divisions wasretained, bat, while previously each division had formed adistinct corps, it was in future left to the general to distri­bute the cohorts of which he had the disposal in the threelines as he thought best. Military rank was determinedsolely by the numerical order of the soldiers and of the divi­sions. The four standards of the several parts of thelegion—the wolf, the ox with a man's head,'the horse, theboar—which had hitherto probably been carried before thecavalry and the three divisions of heavy infantry, disap­peared ; there remained only the ensigns of the new cohorts,and the new standard which Marius gave to the legion asa whole—the silver eagle. Within the legion every traceof the previous civic and aristocratic classification thus dis­appeared, and the only distinctions henceforth occurringamong the legionaries were purely military; but accidentalcircumstances had some thirty years before this given rise toa privileged division of the army alongside of the legions—thebody guard of the general. It is traceable to the Numan-tine war, in which Scipio JEmilianus, not furnished by thegovernment with new troops as he desired, and compelled inpresence of an utterly unruly soldiery to have a care of hispersonal safety, had formed out of volunteers a band of 500men, and had afterwards received into it by way of rewardhis ablest soldiers (P. 16). This cohort, called that of thefriends or more usually that of the head-quarters (prcetoriani),had the duty of serving at head-quarters (prcetorium); in con­sideration of which it was exempt from encamping and en­trenching service, and enjoyed higher pay and greater repute.Political This complete revolution in the constitution of the Roman

to executioners, confiscations of goods, summary procedurewith insubordinate officers had occurred a hundred times,and the obtuse political morality of ancient civilization hadfor such things but lukewarm censure; but it was unexam­pled that the names of the outlaws should be publiclyposted up and their heads publicly exposed, that a set sumshould be fixed for the bandits who slew them and that itshould be duly entered in the public account-books, thatthe confiscated property should be brought to the hammerlike the spoil of an enemy in the public market, that thegeneral should order a refractory officer to be at once cutdown and acknowledge the deed before all the people. Thispublic mockery of humanity was also a political error; itcontributed not a little to envenom later revolutionarycrises beforehand, and on that account even now a darkshadow deservedly rests on the memory of the author ofthe proscriptions.
Sulla may moreover be justly blamed that, while in allimportant matters he acted with remorseless vigour, insubordinate and more especially in personal questions hevery frequently yielded to his sanguine temperament anddealt according to his likings or dislikings. Wherever hereally felt hatred, as for instance against the Marians,he allowed it to take its course without restraint evenagainst the innocent, and made it his boast that no one hadbetter requited friends and foes.* He scorned not to takeadvantage of his place and power to accumulate a colossalfortune. The first absolute monarch of the Roman state, heforthwith verified the maxim of absolutism—that the lawsdo not bind the prince—in the case of those laws which hehimself issued as to adultery and extravagance. But hislenity towards his own party and his own circle was morepernicious for the state than his indulgence towardshimself. The laxity of his military discipline, although itwas partly enjoined by his political exigencies, may bereckoned as coining under this category; but far more per­nicious was his indulgence towards his political adherents.The extent of his forbearance occasionally is hardly credible;for instance Lucius Murena was not only released from

resigning his tribunate, was very far from being the worstof the threats thrown out against the tribune. Gracchusbelieved, probably with reason, that his personal safety wasimperilled, and no longer appeared in the Forumj without aretinue of 3000 or 4000 men—a step which drew down onhim bitter expressions in the senate, even from Metelluswho was not averse to reform in itself. Altogether, if hehad expected to reach the end by the carrying of his agrarianlaw, he had now to learn that he was only at the beginning.The "people" owed him gratitude; but he was a lost man,if he had no further protection than that gratitude of thepeople, if he did not qoptinjie indispensable to them anddid not constantly attach to' himself fresh interests andhopes by means of other and mor^gfcomprehensive proposals.Just at that time the kingdom and wealth of the Attalidshad fallen to the Romans by the testament of the last kingof Pergamus. Gracchus proposed to the people that thePergamene treasure should be distributed among the newlandholders for the procuring of the requisite implementsand stock, and vindicated generally, in opposition to theexisting practice, the right of the burgesses to decide defini­tively as to the new province. He is said to have preparedfurther popular measures, for shortening the period of ser­vice, for extending the right of appeal, for abolishing the ex­clusive privilege of the senators to act as civil jurymen, andeven for the admission of the Italian allies to Roman citizen­ship. How far his projects in reality- reached, cannot beascertained; this alone is certain, that Gracchus saw thathis only safety lay in inducing the burgesses to confer onhim for a second year the office which protected him, andthat, with a view to obtain this unconstitutional prolonga­tion, he held forth a prospect of further reforms. If atfirst he had risked himself in order to save the common­wealth, he was now obliged to put the commonwealth atstake in order to his own safety.
The tribes met to elect the tribunes for the ensuing year, He solicitsand the first divisions gave their votes for Gracchus; but the re-electionopposite party in the end prevailed with their veto so far at t0 the tri"least, that the assembly broke up without having aeconi- bunate-plished its object, and the decision was postponed to thefollowing day.

in consequence of the rejection of the proposal brought in byFlaccus—the first instance which had occurred for a hundredand fifty years of a serious insurrection, not fomented byforeign powers, in Italy against the Roman hegemony. Buton this occasion the fire was successfully extinguished beforeit had caught hold of other allied communities. Not throughthe superiority of the Roman arms, but through the treacheryof a Fregellan Quintus Numitorius Pullus, the praetor LuciusOpimius quickly became master of the revolted city, whichlost its civic privileges and its walls and was converted likeCapua into a village. The colony of Fabrateria wasfounded on a part of its territory in 630; the remainder 124.and the former city itself were distributed among the sur­rounding communities. This rapid and fearful punishmentalarmed the allies, and endless impeachments for high treasonpursued not only the Fregellans, but also the leaders of thepopular party in Rome, who naturally were regarded by thearistocracy as accomplices in this insurrection. MeanwhileGaius Gracchus reappeared in Rome. The aristocracy hadfirst sought to detain the object of their dread in Sardinia byomitting to provide the usual relief, and then, when withoutcaring for that point he returned, had brought him to trial asone of the authors of the Fregellan revolt (629-30). But 125-124.the burgesses acquitted him; and now he too threw downthe gauntlet, became a candidate for the tribuneship of thepeople, and was nominated to that office for the year 631 in 123.an elective assembly attended by unusual numbers. Warwas thus declared. The democratic party, always poor inleaders of ability, had from sheer necessity remained vir­tually at rest for nine years; now the truce was at an end,and this time they were headed by a man, who with morehonesty than Carbo, and with more talent than Flaccus,was in every respect called to take the lead.
Gaius Gracchus (601-633) was very different from his 153-121.brother, who was about nine years older. Like the latter, Gainshe had no relish for vulgar pleasures and vulgar pursuits; he Gracchus-was a man of thorough culture and a brave soldier; he hadserved with distinction before Numantia under his brother-in-law, and afterwards in Sardinia.

For his fleet the satrapyof Colchis supplied him with the most excellent timber,which was floated down from the Caucasus, besides flax, hemp,pitch, and wax; pilots and officers were hired in Phoeniciaand Syria. The king, it was said, had marched into Cappa-docia with 600 scythe-chariots, 10,000 horse, and 80,000foot; and he had by no means mustered for this war all hisresources.

These circumstances indeed formed the subject ofdiscussion in the senate; but when the illustrious corpo­ration consoled itself in the affair of the Paphlagonian suc­cession with the fact that Mithradates appealed to thetestament and Nicomedes to his Pseudo-Pylaemenes, it wasevidently not so much deceived as grateful for any pretextwhich spared it from interference. Meanwhile the com­plaints became daily more numerous and more urgent.The princes of the Tauric Scythians, whom Mithradates haddriven from the Crimea, turned for help to Rome; those ofthe senators who at all reflected on the traditional maximsof Roman policy could not but recollect that formerly, undercircumstances so wholly different, the crossing of kingAntiochus to Europe and the occupation of the Thracian

CHAPTER IV.
THE RULE OF THE RESTORATION.
The new structure, which Gaiu^ Gracchus' had reared, he- Vacancy incame on his death a ruin. Hi$ death indeed, like that of the govern­ing brother, was primarily a mere act of vengeance; but it ment-was at the same time a very material step towards the restora­tion of the old constitution, when the person of the monarchwas taken away from the monarchy just as it was on thepoint of being established. It was all the more $o in thepresent instance, because after the fall of 0 aius and thesweeping and bloody prosecutions of Opimius there existed atthe moment absolutely no one, who, either through relation­ship to the fallen chief of the state or through pre-eminentability, could feel himself warranted in even attempting tooccupy the vacant place. Gaiu$ had departed from, theworld childless, and the $on whom Tiberiu^ had left behindhim died before reaching manhood; the whole popular party,as it was called, was literally without any one who could benamed as leader. The Gracchan constitution resembled afortress without a commander; the walls and garrison wereuninjured, but the general was wanting, and there was noone to take possession of the vacant place save the verygovernment which had been overthrown.
So it accordingly happened. After the decease of Gaius The re-Gracchus without heirs, the government of the senate as it stored aris-were spontaneously resumed its sway; and this was the more tocracy.natural, that it had not been, in the strict sense, formallyabolished by Gaius Gracchus, but had only been reduced toa nullity in point of fact by his exceptional proceedings.Yet we should greatly err, if we should discern in this

Cilicia, and to it the original stock of the population alongthe west coast in the Carian and Lydian provinces seemsalso to have belonged, while the north-western point wasoccupied by the Bithynians, who were related to the Thra-cians in Europe. The interior and the north coast, on theother hand, were filled chiefly by Indo-Germanic peoplesmost nearly cognate to the Iranian. In the case of theArmenian and Phrygian languages* it is ascertained, in thatof the Cappadocian it is highly probable, that they had im­mediate affinity with the Zend; and the statement made asto the Mvsians, that among them the Lydian and Phrygianlanguages met, just denotes a mixed Semitic-Iranian popu­lation that may be compared perhaps with that of Assyria.As to the regions stretching between Cilicia and Caria, moreespecially Lycia, there is still, notwithstanding the full re­mains of the native language and writing that are in thisparticular instance extant, a want of reliable results, and itis merely probable that these tribes ought to be reckonedamong the Indo-Germans rather than the Semites. Howall this confused mass of peoples was overlaid first with anet of Greek mercantile cities, and then with the Hellenismcalled into life by the military as well as intellectual ascend­ancy of the Greek nation, has in general outline been setforth already.
In these regions ruled king Mithradates, and that first of Pontus,all in Cappadocia on the Black Sea or Pontus as it was called,a district in which, situated as it was at the north-easternextremity of Asia Minor towards Armenia and in constantcontact with the latter, we may presume that the Iraniannationality preserved itself with less admixture than any­where else in Asia Minor. Not even Hellenism had pene­trated far into that region. With the exception of thecoast where several originally Greek settlements subsisted,—namely the important commercial marts of Trapezus,Amisus, and above all Sinope, the birthplace and resi­dence of Mithradates and the most flourishing city of theempire,—the country was still in a very primitive condition.Not that it had lam waste; on the contrary, as the pro­vince of Pontus is still one of the most fertile on the face of

legislative, authority—and the courts had been dividedbetween them, now the moneyed aristocracy was not onlyunited into a compact and privileged class on the solid basisof material interests, but also, as a judicial and controllingpower, formed part of the state and took its place almoston a footing of equality by the side of the ruling aristocracy.All the old antipathies of the merchants against the nobilitynecessarily, from this time forth, found only too practical anexpression in the sentences of the jurymen; above all, whenthe provincial governors were called to account, the senatorhad to await a decision involving his civil existence at thehands no longer as formerly of his peers, but of greatmerchants and bankers. The feuds between the Romancapitalists and the Roman governors were transplanted fromthe provincial administration to the dangerous field of theseprocesses of reckoning. Not only was the aristocracy of therich divided, but care was taken that the variance shouldalways find fresh nourishment and easy expression.
With his weapons—the proletariate and the mercantile Monarchicalclass—thus prepared Gracchus proceeded to his main work, governmentthe overthrow of the ruling aristocracy. The overthrow of ™Dst1tutedthe senate meant, on the one hand, the depriving it of the jtjj se^ate'substance of its powers by legislative changes; and on theother hand, the ruining of the existing aristocracy by mea­sures of a more personal and transitory kind. Gracchus didboth. The function of administration, in particular, hadhitherto belonged exclusively to the senate; Gracchus tookit away, partly by settling the most important administra­tive questions by means of comitial laws or, in other wordspractically, through tribunician dictation, partly by restrictingthe senate as much as possible in current affairs, partly bytaking business after the most comprehensive fashion intohis own hands. The measures of the former kind have beenmentioned already. The new master of the state withoutconsulting the senate meddled with the state-chest, by im­posing a permanent and oppressive burden on the publicfinances in the distribution of corn; meddled with the do­mains, by sending out colonies not as formerly by decree ofthe senate but by decree of the people; and meddled with theprovincial administration, by overturning through a law of thepeople the financial constitution given by the senate to theprovince of Asia and substituting for it one altogether dif­ferent.

But Mithradates rejected the peace New diffi-and demanded at least that the Romans should not insist on culties-the surrender of the war-vessels and should concede to himPaphlagonia; while he at the same time asserted thatFimbria was ready to grant him far more favourable condi­tions. Sulla, offended by this placing of his offers on anequal footing with those of a private adventurer, and havingalready gone to the utmost measure of concession, broke offthe negotiations. He had employed the interval to reor­ganize Macedonia and to chastise the Dardani, Sinti, andMaedi, in doing which he at once procured booty for hisarmy and. drew nearer Asia; for he was resolved at any Sulla pro­rate to go thither, in order to come to a settlement with ceeds toFimbria. He now at once put his legions stationed in Aiila-Thrace as well as his fleet in motion towards the Hellespont.'Then at length Archelaus succeeded in wringing from hisobstinate master a reluctant consent to the treaty; forwhich he was subsequently regarded with an evil eye atcourt as the author of the injurious peace, and even accusedof treason, so that some time afterwards he found himselfcompelled to leave the country and to take refuge with theRomans who readily received him and loaded him withhonours. The Roman soldiers murmured; their disap­pointment doubtless at not receiving the expected spoilof Asia probably contributed to that murmuring more thantheir indignation—in itself very justifiable—that the barba­rian prince, who had murdered eighty thousand of their coun­trymen and had brought unspeakable misery on Italy andAsia, should be allowed to return home unpunished withthe greatest part of the treasures which he had collected bythe pillage of Asia.

But these victories had an effect which the victors did notanticipate. For a considerable period an "unsettled people"had been wandering along the northern verge of the countryoccupied by the Celts on both sides of the Danube. Theycalled themselves the Cimbri, that is, the Chempho, thechampions or, as their enemies translated it, the robbers; adesignation, however, which to all appearance had becomethe name of the people even before their migration. Theycame from the north, and the first Celtic people with whomthey came in contact were, so far as is known, the Boii, pro-bly in Bohemia. More exact details as to the cause and thedirection of their migration have not been recorded by con­temporaries, f and cannot be supplied by conjecture, since thestate of things in those times to the north of Bohemia andthe Main and to the east of the Lower R.hine lies whollybeyond our knowledge. But the hypothesis that theCimbri as well as the similar horde of the Teutoneswhich afterwards joined them belonged in the main not tothe Celtic nation, to which the Romans at first assignedthem, but to the Germanic, is supported by the most defi­nite facts : viz., by the existence of two small tribes of thesame name—remnants left behind to all appearance intheir primitive seats—the Cimbri in the modern Denmark,the Teutones in the north-east of Germany in the neighbour­hood of the Baltic, where Pytheas, a contemporary of Alex­ander the Great, makes mention of them thus early inconnection with the amber trade; by the insertion of theCimbri and Teutones in the list of the Germanic peoplesamong the Ingarvones alongside of the Chauci; by the judg­ment of Caesar, who first made the Romans acquainted


* As, according to Velleius and Eutropius, the tribe conquered by Minuciuswas the Scordisci, it can only be through an error on the part of Florus thathe mentions the Hebrus (the Maritza) instead of the Margus (Morava).
f The account that large tracts on the coasts of the North Sea had beentorn away by inundations, and that this had occasioned the migration of theCimbri in a body (Strabo, rii. 293) does not indeed appear to us fabulous, as itseemed to the Greek inquirers; but whether it was based on tradition or onconjecture, cannot be decided.

of "Oscan plays" or "plays of Atella" was commonlyused for these exhibitions.* But these pleasantries hadnothing to do with the stage f and with literature; theywere performed by amateurs where and when they pleased,and the text was not written or at any rate was not pub-
* With these names there has been associated from ancient times a series oferrors. The utter mistake of Greek reporters, that these farces were played atRome in the Oscan language, is now with justice universally rejected; but itis, on a closer consideration, little short of impossible to bring these pieces,which are laid in the midst of Latin town and country life, into relation withthe national Oscan character at all. The appellation of " Atellan play " is to beexplained in another way. The Latin farce with its fixed characters andstanding jests needed a permanent scenery: the fool-world everywhere seeksfor itself a local habitation. Of course under the Roman stage-police none ofthe Roman communities, or of the Latin communities allied with Rome, couldbe taken for this purpose. But Atella, which was destroyed de jure alongwith Capua in 543 (ii. 170, 190) but continued practically to subsist as a 211.village inhabited by Roman farmers, was adapted in every respect for the pur­pose. This conjecture is changed into certainty by our observing that severalof these farces are laid in other communities within the domain of the Latintongue which existed no longer at all, or no longer at any rate in the eye of thelaw—such as the Campani of Pomponius and perhaps also his Adelphi andhis Qumquatria in Capua, and the Milites Pometinenses of Novius in SuessaPometia—while no existing community was subjected to a similar abuse. Thereal home of these pieces was therefore Latium, their poetical stage was theLatinized Oscan land; with the Oscan nation they have no connection. Thestatement that a piece of Naevius (-f after 550) was for want of proper actors 200.performed by "Atellan players" and was therefore called personata (Festus,8. t;.), proves nothing against this view: the appellation " Atellan players" ishere employed proleptically, and we might even conjecture from this passagethat they were formerly termed " masked players" (jpersonati).
An explanation quite similar may be given of the "lays of Fescennium,"which likewise belong to the burlesque poetry of the Romans and were localizedin the South Etruscan village of Fescennium; it is not necessary on thataccount to class them with Etruscan poetry any more than the Atellanae withOscan. That Fescennium was in historical times not a town but a village, can­not certainly be directly proved, but is in the highest degree probable from theway in which authors mention the place and from the silence of inscriptions.
f The close and original connection, which Livy in particular represents assubsisting between the Atellan tarce and the satura with the drama thencedeveloped, is not at all tenable. The difference between the histrio and theAtellan player was just about as great as is at present the difference between aprofessional actor and a man who goes to a masked ball; between the dramaticpiece, which down to Terence's time had no masks, and the Atellan, which wasessentially based on the character-mask, there subsisted an original distinctionin no way to be effaced. The drama arose out of the flute-piece, which at firstwithout any recitation was confined merely to song and dance, then acquired atext (satura), and lastly obtained through Andronicus a libretto borrowed fromthe Greek stage, in which the old flute-lays occupied nearly the place of theGreek chorus. This course of development nowhere in its earlier stages cameinto contact with the farce, which was performed by amateurs.

order that he might not at some future time come fromAsia to the help of the Italian revolution, just as Sulla nowhoped to return from Asia and crush it. At Cypsela on theHebrus Sulla obtained accounts of the ratification of thepeace by Mithradates; but the march to Asia went on.The king, it was said, desired personally to confer with theRoman general and to cement the peace with him; it maybe presumed that this was simply a convenient pretext fortransferring the army to Asia and there putting an end toFimbria. So Sulla, attended by his legions and by Arche- Peace atlaus, crossed the Hellespont; after he had met with Mith- Dardanus.radates on its Asiatic shore at Dardanus and had orallyconcluded the treaty, he made his army continue its marchtill he came upon the camp of Fimbria at Thyatira not farfrom Pergamus, and pitched his own close beside it. The SullaSullan soldiers, far superior to the Fimbrians in number, againstdiscipline, leadership, and ability, looked with contempt on Flmtlria.the dispirited and demoralized troops and their uncalledcommander-in-chief. Desertions from the ranks of the Fim­brians became daily more numerous. When Fimbria orderedan attack, the soldiers refused to fight against their fellow-citizens, or even to take the oath which he required thatthey would stand faithfully by each other in battle. Anattempt to assassinate Sulla miscarried; at the conferencewhich Fimbria requested Sulla did not make his appearance,but contented himself with suggesting to him through oneof his officers a means of personal escape. Fimbria was of Fimbria'san insolent temperament, but he was no poltroon; instead death.of accepting the vessel which Sulla offered to him and flee­ing to the barbarians, he went to Pergamus and fell on hisown sword in the temple of Asklepios. Those who weremost compromised in his army resorted to Mithradates orto the pirates, with whom they found ready reception; themain body placed itself under the orders of Sulla.
Sulla determined to leave these two legions, whom he did Regulationnot trust for the impending war, behind in Asia, where the of Asiaticfearful crisis left for long its lingering traces in the several affairs-cities and districts. The command of this corps and thegovernorship of Roman Asia he committed to his best officer,Lucius Licinius Murena. The revolutionary measures ofMithradates, such as the liberation of the slaves and theannulling of debts, were of course cancelled; a restoration,which in many places could not be carried into effect without

to preserve himself if possible for better times. Gracchus wasinduced to make an attempt to escape to the other bank ofthe Tiber; but when hastening down the hill he fell andsprained his foot. To gain time for hiui to escape, his twoattendants turned to face his pursuers and allowed them­selves to be cut down, Marcus Pomponius at the PortaTrigemina under the Aventine, Publius Laetorius at thebridge over the Tiber where Horatius Codes was said tohave once singly withstood the Etruscan army; so Gracchus,attended only by his slave Euporus, reached the suburb onthe right bank of the Tiber. There, in the grove of Furrina,were afterwards found the two dead bodies; it seemed as ifthe slave had put to death first his master and then himself.The heads of the two fallen leaders were handed over to thegovernment as required; the stipulated price and more waspaid to Lucius Septumuleius, a noble, who delivered up thehead of Gracchus, while the murderers of Flaccus, personsof humble position, were sent away with empty hands.The bodies of the dead were thrown into the river; thehouses of the leaders were abandoned to the pillage of themultitude. The warfare of prosecutions against the parti­sans of Gracchus began on the grandest scale; as many as3000 of them are said to have been strangled in prison,amongst whom was Quintus Flaccus, eighteen years of age,who had taken no part in the conflict, and was universallylamented on account of his youth and his amiableness.On the open space beneath the Capitol, where the altarconsecrated by Camillus- after the restoration of internalpeace (i. 305) and other shrines erected on similar occa­sions to Concord were situated, these small chapels werepulled down; and out of the property of the killed orcondemned traitors, which was confiscated even to theportions of their wives, a new and spleudid temple of Con­cord with the basilica belonging to it was erected in accord­ance with a decree of the senate by the consul LuciusOpimius. Certainly it was an act in accordance with thespirit of the age to remove the memorials of the old, and toinaugurate a new, Concord over the remains of the threegrandsons of the conqueror of Zama, all of whom—firstTiberius Gracchus, then Scipio jEmilianus, and lastly theyoungest and most vehement, Gaius Gracchus—had now beenengulfed by the revolution.

for the debtor to be not merely subjected to moral torture,but directly placed upon the rack. To these sources ofgain fell to be added the wholesale traffic. The exportsand imports of Italy were very considerable. The formerconsisted chiefly of wine and oil, with which Italy andGreece almost exclusively—for the production of wine inthe Massiliot and Turdetanian territories can at that timehave been but small—supplied the whole region of theMediterranean; Italian wine was sent in considerable quan­tities to the Balearic islands and Celtiberia, to Africa, whichwas merely a corn and pasture country, to Narbo and theinterior of Gaul. Still more considerable was the importa­tion to Italy, where at that time all luxury was concentrated,and whither most articles of luxury for food, drink, orclothing, ornaments, books, household furniture, works of artwere imported by sea. The traffic in slaves, above all, receivedthrough the ever-increasing demand of the Roman mer­chants an impetus to which no parallel had been known inthe region of the Mediterranean, and which was very closelyconnected with the flourishing of piracy. All lands and allnations were laid under contribution for slaves, but theplaces where they were chiefly captured were Syria and theinterior of Asia Minor (P. 78). In Italy the transmarine Ostia,imports were chiefly concentrated in the two great emporia Puteoli.on the Tyrrhene sea, Ostia and Puteoli. The grain des­tined for the capital was brought to Ostia, which was farfrom having a good roadstead, but which as the nearestport to Rome was the most appropriate mart for less valuablewares; whereas the traffic in luxuries with the East wasdirected mainly to Puteoli, which recommended itself by itsgood harbour for ships with valuable cargoes, and presentedin its immediate neighbourhood a market little inferior tothat of the capital—the district of Baiae, which came to bemore and more filled with villas. For a long time thislatter traffic was conducted through Corinth and after itsdestruction through Delos, and in this sense accordinglyPuteoli is called by Lucilius the Italian "little Delos;"but after the catastrophe which befel Delos in the Mithra-datic war (P. 297), and from which it never recovered, thePuteolans entered into direct commercial connections withSyria and Alexandria, and their city became more and moredecidedly the first seat of transmarine commerce in Italy.But it was not merely the gain which was made by the

time to hold his ground, we may say, as a captain of robbersand to lead the state as its first citizen—a dilemma to which•Pericles, Caesar, and Napoleon had also to make dangeroussacrifices. But the conduct of Gaius Gracchus cannotbe wholly explained from this necessity; along with it thereworked in him that consuming passion, that glowing re­venge, which foreseeing its own destruction hurls the fire­brand iuto the house of the foe. He has himself expressedwhat he thought of his ordinance as to the jurymen andsimilar measures intended to divide the aristocracy; hecalled them daggers, which he had thrown into the Forumthat the burgesses—the nobles, of course—might lacerateeach other with them. He was a political incendiary. Notonly was the hundred years' revolution which dates fromhim, so far as it was one man's work, the work of GaiusGracchus, but he was above all the true founder of thatterrible civic proletariate flattered and paid by the classesabove it, which was through its aggregation in the capital—thenatural consequence of the largesses of corn—at once utterlydemoralized and made conscious of its power, and which—with its pretensions, sometimes stupid, sometimes knavish,and its talk of the sovereignty of the people—lay like an in­cubus for five hundred years upon the Roman commonwealthand only perished along with it. And yet again, this greatestof political transgressors was the regenerator of his country.There is scarce a fruitful idea in Roman monarchy, which isnot traceable to Gaius Gracchus. From him proceeded themaxim—founded indeed in a certain sense in the nature ofthe traditionary laws of war, but yet in the extensionand practical application now given to it foreign to the olderstate-law—that all the land of the subject communities wasto be regarded as the private property of the state; amaxim, which was primarily employed to vindicate the rightof the state to tax that land at pleasure, as was the case inAsia, or to apply it for the institution of colonies, as wasdone in Africa, and which became afterwards a fundamentalprinciple of law under the Empire. From him proceededthe tactics adopted by the demagogues and tyrants, wherebywith the support of material interests they broke down thegoverning aristocracy, but subsequently legitimized thechange of constitution by substituting a strict and judiciousadministration for the previous misgovernment.

view, as anything else than a political institution; yet thenational spirit in them was too strong and their sense ofdecorum too delicate to have permitted their coming forwardin public with such dangerous explanations. But even iuthe following generation the pontifex maximus QuintusScaevola (consul in 659; P. 219, 336) set forth at least inhis oral instructions in law without hesitation the proposi­tions, that there were two sorts of religion—one philosophic,adapted to the intellect, and one traditional, not so adapted;that the former was not fitted for .the religion of the stateas it contained various things which it was useless or eveninjurious for the people to know; and that accordingly thetraditional religion of the state ought to remain as it stood.The theology of Varro, in which the Roman religion is treatedthroughout as a state institution, is merely a further deve­lopment of the same principle. The state, according to histeaching, was older than the gods of the state as the painteris older than the picture; if the question related to makingthe gods anew, it would certainly be well to make and toname them after a manner more befitting and more intheoretic accordance with the parts of the world-soul, andto lay aside the images of the gods which only excitederroneous ideas,* and the mistaken system of sacrifice; but,since these institutions had been once established, every goodcitizen ought to own and follow them and do his part, thatthe " common man " might learn rather to set a higher valueon, than to contemn, the gods. That the common man, forwhose benefit the grandees thus surrendered their judgment,now despised this faith and sought his remedy elsewhere,was a matter of course and will be seen in the sequel.Thus then the Roman "high church" was ready, a sancti­monious body of priests and Levites, and an unbelievingpeople. The more openly the religion of the land wasdeclared a political institution, the more decidedly thepolitical parties regarded the field of the state-church asan arena for attack and defence; which was especially, ina daily increasing measure, the case with augural scienceand with the elections to the priestly colleges.

province of Cilicia, which thenceforth appears among theRoman provinces.* The design was commendable, and thescheme in itself was well devised; but the continuanceand the increase of the evil of piracy in the Asiatic waters,and especially in Cilicia, unhappily showed the inadequacy ofthe means with which the pirates were assailed from the newlyacquired position.
But nowhere did the impotence and perversity of theRoman provincial administration come to light in so nakedcolours as in the insurrections of the provincial proleta­riate, which seemed to have revived on their former footingsimultaneously with the restoration of the aristocracy. Theseinsurrections of the slaves swelling from revolts into wars—which had emerged just about 620 as one, and that perhaps theproximate, cause of the Gracchan revolution—were renewedand repeated with dreary Uniformity. Again, as thirty yearsbefore, a ferment pervaded the body of slaves throughoutthe Roman empire. We have already mentioned the Italianconspiracies.

Cilicia only took place after the Cilician expedition of Publius Servilius in 67692. et spq., but erroneously; for as early as 662 we find Si'lla (Appian, Mithr.80. 79. 57; B.C. i. 77; Victor, 75), and in 674, 675, Gnaeus Dolabella (Cic. Verr.i. 1, 16, 44) as governors of Cilicia—whicli leaves no alternative but to place102. the establishment of the province in 652. This view is further supported bythe fact, that at this time the expeditions of the Romans against the corsairs—e. g. the Balearic, Ligurian, and Dalmatia expeditions—appear to have beenordinarily directed to the occupation of the points of the coast whence piracyissued; and this was natural, for, as the Romans had no standing fleet, the onlymeans of effectually checking piracy was the occupation of the coasts. It isto be remembered, moreover, that the idea of a provincia did not absolutelyinvolve possession of the country, but in itself implied no more than an inde­pendent military command; it is very possible, that the Romans in the firstinstance occupied nothing in this rugged country save stations for their vesselsand troops.
The plain of eastern Cilicia remained down to the war against Tigranesattached to the Syrian empire (Appian, Syr. 48); the districts to the north ofthe Taurus formerly reckoned as belonging to Cilicia—Coppadocian Cilicia, asit was called, and Cataonia—belonged to Cappadocia, the former from the timeof the breaking up of the kingdom of Attalus (Justin, xxxvii. 1 ; see above,P. 57), the latter probably even from the time of the peace with Autiochus.

In every place through which ,the deceased was borne in regal attire, with his well-knownstandards and fasces before him, the inhabitants and aboveall his old troops joined the mourning train; it seemed asif the whole army would once more meet round the hero indeath, who had in life led it so often and never except tovictory. So the endless funeral procession reached thecapital, where the courts kept holiday and all business wassuspended, and two thousand golden chaplets awaited thedead—the last honorary gifts of the faithful legions, of thecities, and of his more intimate friends. Sulla, faithful tothe usage of the Cornelian house, had ordered that his bodyBhould be buried without being burnt; but others weremore mindful than he was of what past days had done andfuture days might do: by command of the senate thecorpse of the man, who had disturbed the bones of Mariusfrom their rest in the grave, was committed to the flames.Headed by all the magistrates and the whole senate, by the

This lastconspiracy was so important, that the urban praetor had tomarch with a legion against it and yet overcame the insur­rection not by force of arms, but only by insidious treachery.It was moreover a suspicious circumstance, that the insur­rection was headed not by a slave, but by the Roman knightTitus Vettius, whom his debts had driven to the insane stepof manumitting his slaves and declaring himself their king(650). The apprehensions of the government with reference 104.to the accumulation of bodies of slaves in Italy are shown bythe measures of precaution respecting the gold-washings ofVictumulas, which were carried on after 611 on account of 143.the Roman government: the lessees were first bound notto employ more than 5000 labourers, and then the workingswere totally stopped by decree of the senate. Under sucha government as the present there was every reason in factfor fear, if, as was very possible, a Transalpine host shouldpenetrate into Italy and summon the slaves, who were ingreat part of kindred lineage, to arms.

Butthe battles of the rough farmer, who had been raised tohonour by the common people and had led the commonpeople to victory, were not merely defeats of the Cimbri andTeutones, but also defeats of the government: there wereassociated with them hopes far different from that of beingable once more to carry on mercantile transactions on the oneside of the Alps or to cultivate the fields without molestationon the other. Twenty years had elapsed since the bloodycorpse of Gaius Gracchus had been flung into the Tiber; fortwenty years the government of the restored oligarchy hadbeen endured and cursed; still there had risen no avenger forGracchus, no second master to prosecute the building whichne had begun.

Now a letter from him reached the senate, in -whichhe reported the termination of the war and announced hisreturn to Italy; he stated that he would respect the rightsconferred on the new burgesses, and that, while measures ofpunishment were inevitable, they would light not on themasses, but on the authors of the mischief.

The nature of this coalitionand its mode of conflict are clearly and distinctly seen froman accidentally preserved fragment of the speech which theconsul Gaius Fannius made to the burgesses in opposition tothe proposal. "Do ye then think," said the Optimate,"that, if ye confer the franchise on the Latins, ye willbe able to find a place in future—just as you are now stand­ing there in front of me—in the burgess assembly or at thegames and popular amusements? Do you not believe, on thecontrary, that those people will occupy every spot?" Amongthe burgesses of the fifth century, who on one day conferredthe franchise on all the Sabines, such an orator might per­haps have been hissed; those of the seventh found hisreasoning uncommonly clear and the price of the assignationof the Latin domains, which was offered to it by Gracchus,far too low. The very circumstance, that the senate carrieda permission to eject from the city all non-burgesses beforethe day for the decisive vote, showed the fate in storefor the proposal. And when before the voting LiviusDrusus, a colleague of Gracchus, interposed his veto againstthe law, the people received the veto in such a way thatGracchus could not venture to proceed further or to preparefor Drusus the fate of Marcus Octavius.Overthrow It was, apparently, this success which emboldened theof Gracchus, senate to attempt the overthrow of the victorious dema­gogue. The weapons of attack were substantially the samewith which Gracchus himself had formerly operated.Gracchus' power rested on the mercantile class and theproletariate, primarily on the latter, which as it wereplayed the part of the army in this conflict wherein neitherside had any military reserve. It was clear that the senatewas not powerful enough to wrest either from the merchantsor from the proletariate their new privileges; every attempt toassail the corn-laws or the new jury-arrangement would haveled, under a somewhat grosser or somewhat more civilizedform, to a street-riot in presence of which the senate wasutterly defenceless. But it was no less clear, that Gracchushimself and these merchants and proletarians were only kepttogether by mutual advantage, and that the men of materialinterests were ready to accept their posts, and the populacestrictly so-called its bread, just as well from any other as

produced a deep effect: the army intrusted him with thesupreme command. Viriathus gave orders to the mass ofhis men to proceed in detached parties, by different routes,to the appointed rendezvous; he himself formed the bestmounted and most trustworthy into a corps of 1000 horse,with which he covered the departure of the rest. TheRomans, who wanted light cavalry, did not venture to dis­perse for the pursuit under the eyes of the enemy's horse­men. After Viriathus and his band had for two whole daysheld in check the entire Roman army, he suddenly disap­peared during the night and hastened to the general ren­dezvous. The Roman general followed him, but fell into anadroitly laid ambuscade, in which he lost the half of hisarmy and was himself captured and slain; with difficultythe rest of the troops escaped to the colony of Carteianear to the straits. In all haste 5000 men of the Spanishmilitia were despatched from the Ebro to reinforce the de­feated Romans; but Viriathus destroyed the corps whilestill on its march, and commanded so absolutely thewhole interior of Carpetania that- the Romans did noteven venture to seek him there. Viriathus, now recognizedas lord and king of all the Lusitanians, knew how to com­bine the full dignity of his princely position with the homelyhabits of a shepherd. No badge distinguished him from thecommon soldier: he rose from the richly adorned marriage-table of his father-in-law, the prince Astolpa in RomanSpain, without having touched the golden plate and thesumptuous fare, lifted his bride on horseback, and rode offwith her to his mountains. He never took more of the spoilthan the share which he allotted to each of his comrades.The soldier recognized the general simply by his tall figure,by his striking sallies of wit, and above all by the fact thathe surpassed every one of his men in temperance as well asin toil, sleeping always in full armour and fighting in front ofall in battle.

fessional sciences. The literary cue was correctness, in thestyle of art and above all in the language, which, as a morelimited circle of persons of culture became separated fromthe body of the people, was in its turn divided into theclassical Latin of higher society and the vulgar Latin of thecommon people. The prologues of Terence promise "pureLatin;" warfare with faults of language forms a chiefelement of the Lucilinn satire; and with this circumstanceis connected the fact, that composition in Greek among theRomans now falls decidedly into the shade. In so far cer­tainly there is an improvement; inadequate efforts occur inthis epoch far less frequently; performances in their kindcomplete and thoroughly pleasing occur far oftener thanbefore or afterwards; in a linguistic point of view Cicerocalls the age of Laelius and Scipio the golden age of pureunadulterated Latin. In like manner literary activity gra­dually rises in public opinion from a trade to an art. At thebeginning of this period the preparation of theatrical piecesat any rate, if not the publication of recitative poems, wasstill regarded as not becoming for the noble Roman; Pacu-vius and Terence lived by their pieces; the writing ofdramas was entirely a trade, and not one of golden produce.About the time of Sulla the state of matters had entirelychanged. The remuneration given to actors at that timeproves that the favourite dramatic poet could then claim a pay­ment, the high amount of which removed its stigma. By thismeans composing for the stage was raised into a liberal art;and we accordingly find. men of the highest aristocraticcircles, such as Lucius Caesar (aedile in 664, + 667), engaged 90. 87,in writing for the Roman stage and proud of sitting in theRoman " poet's club" by the side of the ancestorless Accius.. Art finds increased sympathy and honour; but the enthu­siasm has departed in life and in literature. The fearlessself-confidence, which makes the poet a poet, and which isvery decidedly apparent in Plautus especially, is found innone of those that follow; the Epigoni of the men thatfought with Hannibal are correct, but feeble.
Let us first glance at the Roman dramatic literature and Tragedy,tbe stage itself. Tragedy has now for the first time her spe­cial representatives; the tragic poets of this epoch do not,like those of the preceding, cultivate comedy and epos also.The appreciation of this branch of art among the writingand reading circles was evidently on the increase, but tragic

the idea of taking up the war in Greece, to enter into burgesses
winter-quarters at Ariminum. But Sulla's offers met no a™ against
better reception on that account; the senate rejected his Sulla-
proposals without even allowing the envoys to enter Rome,
and enjoined him summarily to lay down arms. It was not
the coterie of the Marians, which primarily brought about
this resolute attitude. That faction was obliged to abandon
its hitherto usurped occupation of the supreme magistracy
at the very time when it was of moment, and again
to institute consular elections for the decisive year 671. 83.
The suffrages on this occasion were united not in favour of
the former consul Carbo or of any of the able officers of the
hitherto ruling clique, such as Quiutus Sertorius or Gaius
Marius the younger, but in favour of Lucius Scipio and
Gaius Norbanus, two incapables, neither of whom knew how
to fight and Scipio not even how to speak; the former
of these recommended himself to the multitude only as the
great-grandson of the conqueror of Antiochus, and the latter
as a political opponent of the oligarchy (P. 217). The
Marians were not so much abhorred for their misdeeds as
despised for their incapacity; but if the nation would have
nothing to do with these, the great majority of it would have
still less to do with Sulla and an oligarchical restoration.
"Warlike preparations went on very earnestly. While Sulla
crossed to Asia and induced such defection in the army of
Fimbria that its leader fell by his own hand, the government
in Italy employed the further interval of a year granted to
it by these steps of Sulla in energetic preparations; it is
said that at Sulla's landing 100,000 men, and afterwards
even double that number of troops, were arrayed in arms
against him.
Against this Italian force Sulla had nothing to place in Difficult uo-the scale except his five legions, which, even including sition ofsome contingents levied in Macedonia and the Peloponnesus, Su'10-probably amounted to scarce 40,000 men. It is true thatthis army had been, during its seven years' conflicts inItaly, Greece, and Asia, weaned from politics, and adheredto its general—who pardoned everything in his soldiers, de­bauchery, bestiality, even mutiny against their officers, re­quired nothing but valour and fidelity towards their general,and set before them the prospect of the most extravagantrewards in the event of victory—with all that soldierly en­thusiasm, which is the more powerful that the noblest and

knowledge to which scientific knowledge was bound to haveregard and even in doubtful cases to subordinate itself.He believed in a different way from the people rather thanin different objects; the essentially true and supreme Godwas in his view doubtless the world-soul, but every mani­festation of the primitive God was in its turn divine, thestars above all, but also the earth, the vine, the soul of theillustrious mortal whom the people honoured as a hero, andgenerally indeed every departed spirit of a former man.This philosophy was really better adapted for Rome thanfor the land where it first arose. The objection of thepious believer, that the god of the Stoic had neither sexnor age nor corporeality and was converted from a personinto an idea, had a meaning in Greece, but not in Rome.The coarse allegorizing and moral purification, which werecharacteristic of the Stoical doctrine as to the gods, destroyedthe very marrow of the Hellenic mythology; but the plasticpower of the Romans, scanty even in their epoch ofsimplicity, had produced no more than a light veil enve­loping the original intuition or the original notion out ofwhich the divinity had arisen—a veil that might be strippedoff" without special damage. Pallas Athene might be indig­nant, when she found herself suddenly transmuted into theidea of memory: Minerva had hitherto been in reality notmuch more. The supernatural Stoic, and the allegoricRoman, theology coincided on the whole in their result.But, even if-the philosopher was obliged to designate indi­vidual propositions of the priestly lore as doubtful or aserroneous—as when the Stoics, for example, rejecting thedoctrine of apotheosis, saw in Hercules, Castor, and Polluxnothing but the spirits of distinguished men, or as whenthey could not allow the images of the gods to be regardedas representations of divinity—it was at least not the habitof the adherents of Zeno to make war on these erroneousdoctrines and to overthrow false gods; on the contrary,they everywhere evinced respect and reverence for thereligion of the land even in its weaknesses. The inclinationalso of the Stoa towards a casuistic morality and towards asystematic treatment of the professional sciences was quiteto the mind of the Romans, especially of the Romans of thisperiod, who no longer like their fathers practised in unso­phisticated fashion self-government and good morals, but re­solved the simple moralitv of their ancestors into a catechism

In agriculture we have already seen Agricul-that the growing power of Roman capital was gradually ture.absorbing the intermediate and small landed estates in Italy aswell as in the provinces, as the sun absorbs the drops of rain.The government not only looked on without preventing,but even promoted this injurious division of the soil by par­ticular measures, especially by prohibiting the productionof wine and oil beyond the Alps with a view to favour thegreat Italian landlords and merchants.* It is true thatboth the opposition and the fraction of the conservativesthat entered into ideas of reform worked energetically tocounteract the evil; the two Gracchi, by carrying out thedistribution of almost the whole domain land, gave to thestate 80,000 new Italian farmers; Sulla, by settling 120,000colonists in Italy, filled up at least in part the gaps whichthe revolution and he himself had made in the ranks of theItalian yeomen. But, when a vessel is emptying itself byconstant efflux, the evil is to be remedied not by pour­ing in even considerable quantities, but only by the esta­blishment of a constant influx—a remedy which was oftensought for, but never with success. In the provinces, noteven the smallest effort was made to save the farmer classthere from being bought out by the Roman speculators; theprovincials were merely men, and belonged to no party. Theconsequence was, that even the rents of the soil beyond Italyflowed more and more to Rome. Moreover the plantation-system, which about the middle of this epoch had alreadygained the ascendant even in particular districts of Italy,such as Etruria, had, through the co-operation of an ener­getic and methodical management and abundant pecuniaryresources, attained to a state of high prosperity after itskind. The production of Italian wine in particular, whichwas artificially promoted partly by the opening of forcedmarkets in a portion of the provinces, partly by the pro­hibition of foreign wines in Italy as expressed for instancein the sumptuary law of 593, attained very considerable 16J.results: the Aminean and Falernian wine began to be

Reinforced thus considerably both in a moral and material Sulla inpoint of view, Sulla and Metellus marched from Apulia Campaniathrough the still insurgent Samnite districts towards Campa- "PP"**"1 °ynia. The main force of the enemy also proceeded thither, an" yciil^o.and it seemed as if the matter must there be brought to adecisive issue. The army of the consul Gains Norbanus wasalready at Capua, where the new colony had just establisheditself with all democratic pomp; the second consular armywas likewise advancing along the Appian road. But, beforeit arrived, Sulla was in front of Norbanus. A last attempt Sulla gainsat mediation, which Sulla made, led only to the arrest of his a Vld£iy.envoys. With fresh indignation his veteran troops threw °™rat °lthemselves on the enemy; their vehement charge down from Mount Ti-Mount Tifata at the first onset broke the enemy drawn fata,up in the plain; with the remnant of his force Norbanusthrew himself into the revolutionary colony of Capua andthe new-burgess town of Neapolis, and allowed himself tobe blockaded there. Sulla's troops, hitherto not withoutapprehension as they compared their weak numbers withthose of the enemy, had b"y this victory gained a full convictionof their military superiority; instead of pausing himself tobesiege the remains of the defeated army, Sulla left thetowns where they were to be invested, and advanced alongthe Appian highway against Teanum, where Scipio was Defection Mposted.

fact, that the three-quarter denarius, which by the arrange­ments of the Roman government was coined both at Mas-silia and in Ulyria, and which had been under the nameof Victoriatus received into the Roman monetary system(ii. 38), was about the middle of the seventh century setaside in the latter; the effect of which necessarily was, thatthe Massiliot and Illyrian currency was driven out of UpperItaly and only remained in circulation, over and above itanative field, perhaps in the regions of the Alps and theDanube. Such progress had thus been made already inthis epoch, that the standard of the denarius exclusively pre­vailed in the whole western division of the Roman state;for Italy, Sicily—of w hich it is as respects the beginning ofthe nest period expressly attested, that no other silvermoney .circulated there but the denarius—Sardinia, Africa,used exclusively Roman silver money, and the provincialsilver still current in Spain as well as the silver money ofthe Massiliots and Illyrians were at least struck after thestandard of the denarius. It was different in the East. Currency ofThere, where the number of the states coining money from tiie East-olden times and the quantity of native coin in circu­lation were very considerable, the denarius did not make itsway into wider acceptance, although it was perhaps declareda legal tender. There either the previous monetary standardcontinued in use, as in Macedonia for instance, which stillas a province—although partially adding the names of theRoman magistrates to that of the country—struck its Attictetradrachmce and certainly employed in substance no othermoney; or a peculiar money-standard corresponding to cir­cumstances was introduced under Roman authority, as onthe institution of the province of Asia, when a new stater,the cistophorus as it was called, was prescribed by the Romangovernment and was thenceforth struck by the district-capi­tals there under Roman superintendence.

historical composition was restricted—with the exception ofthe very respectable but purely individual writings of Cato,which at any rate did not reach beyond the rudiments ofresearch and narration—partly to nursery tales, partly tocollections of notices. The Greeks had certainly exhibitedhistorical research and had written history; but the ideas ofnation and state had been so completely lost amidst the dis­tracted times of the Diadochi, that none of the numeroushistorians succeeded in following the steps of the great Atticmasters in spirit and in truth, or in treating from a broadpoint of view the matter of world-wide interest in the his­tory of the times. Their histories were either purely outwardrecords, or they were pervaded by the verbiage and sophis­tries of Attic rhetoric and only too often by the venality andvulgarity, the sycophancy and the exasperation of the age.Among the Romans as among the Greeks nothing existedbut histories of cities or of tribes. Polybius, a Peloponue-sian, as has been justly remarked, and holding intellectuallya position at least as far aloof from the Attics as from theRomans, first stepped beyond these miserable limits, treatedthe Roman materials with mature Hellenic criticism, andfurnished a history, which was not indeed universal, butwhich was at any rate dissociated from mere local states andaccommodated to the Romano-Greek state in the course offormation. Never perhaps has any historian united withinhimself all the advantages of an author drawing from originalsources so completely as Polybius. The compass of his taskis completely clear and present to him at every moment;and throughout his eye is fixed on the real historical con­nection of events. The legend, the anecdote, the mass ofworthless chronicle-notices are thrown aside; the descrip­tion of countries and peoples, the representation of politicaland mercantile relations—all the facts of such infinite im­portance which escape the annalist because they do notadmit of being nailed to a particular year—are put into pos­session of their long-suspended rights. In the procuring ofhistoric materials Polybius shows a caution and perseverancesuch as are not perhaps paralleled in antiquity; he avails him­self of documents, gives comprehensive attention to theliterature of different nations, makes the most extensive useof his favourable position for collecting the accounts of actorsand eye-witnesses, and, in fine, methodically travels over thewhole domain of the Mediterranean states aud part of the

of nationality and religion among his subjects placed themost material obstacles in the way of the government,yet the plan of introducing throughout his dominionsHellenico-Roman manners and Hellenico-Roman worshipand of equalizing the various peoples in a political as wellas a religious point of view was under any circumstancesan absurdity; and all the more so from the fact, that thiscaricatured Joseph II. was personally far from equal to sogigantic an enterprise, and introduced his reforms in thevery worst way by plundering temples on the greatest scalennd insanely persecuting heretics.
One consequence of this policy was, that the inhabit- The J. vnants of the province next to the Egyptian frontier, theJews, a people formerly submissive even to humility andextremely active and industrious, were driven by systematicreligious persecution to open revolt (about 587). The iermatter came to the senate; and, as it was just at that timewith good reason indignant at Demetrius Soter and appre­hensive of a combination between the Attalids and Seleucids,while the establishment of a power intermediate betweenSyria and Egypt was at any rate for the interest of Rome, itmade no difficulty in at once recognizing the freedom andautonomy of the insurgent nation (about 593). Nothing, igjhowever, was done by Rome for the Jews except what couldbe done without personal exertion: in spite of the clause ofthe treaty concluded between the Romans and the Jewswhich promised Roman aid to the latter in the event oftheir being attacked, and in spite of the injunction addressedto the kings of Syria and Egypt not to march their troopsthrough Judaea, it was of course entirely left to the Jewsthemselves to hold their ground against the Syrian kings.The brave and prudent conduct of the insurrection by theheroic house of the Maccabees and the internal dissension inthe Syrian empire did more for them than the letters of theirpowerful allies; during the strife between the Syrian kingsTrypho and Demetrius Nicator autonomy and exemptionfrom tribute were formally accorded to the Jews (612); and 142soon afterwards the head of the Maccabaean house, Simonson of Mattathias, was even formally acknowledged by thenation as well as by the great king of Syria as high priestand prince of Israel (615).*

even a bond fide proprietary tenure, and, in the exceptional in­stances where he could do so, he was confronted by the factthat by the Roman law prescription availed not against thestate. The distribution of the domains was no abolition,but on the contrary an exercise, of the right of property ; alljurists were agreed as to its formal legality. But the attemptnow to carry out these legal claims of the state was farfrom being politically warranted by the circumstance, thatthe distribution of the domains neither infringed the existingconstitution nor involved a violation of right. Such objec­tions as have been now and then raised in our day, when agreat landlord suddenly begins to assert, in all their com­pass, claims belonging to him in law but suffered for a longperiod to lie dormant in practice, might with equal andbetter right be advanced against the rogation of Gracchus.These occupied domains had been undeniably in heritableprivate possession, some of them for three hundred years;the state's proprietorship of the soil, which from its verynature loses more readily than that of the burgess the charac­ter of private right, had in the case of these lands becomevirtually extinct, and the present holders had universallycome to their possessions by purchase or other onerous ac­quisition. The jurist might say what he would; to men ofbusiness the measure appeared to be an ejection of the greatlandholders for the benefit of the agricultural proletariate;and, in fact, no statesman could give it any other name.That the leading men of, the Catonian epoch were of thesame opinion, is very clearly shown by their treatment of asimilar case that occurred in their time. The territory ofCapua and the neighbouring towns, which was annexed as
211. domain in 543, had for the most part practically passed intoprivate possession in the following unsettled times. In thelast years of the sixth century, when in various respects,especially through the influence of Cato, the reins of govern­ment were drawn tighter, the burgesses resolved to resumethe Campanian territory and to lease it for the benefit of
172. the treasury (582). The possession in this instance restedon an occupation justified not by the previous invitationbut at the most by the connivance of the authorities, andhad continued in no case much beyond a generation; but theholders were not dispossessed except in consideration of acompensatory sum disbursed under the orders of the senate

Thisnew office derived its name from the dictatorship, which hadbeen practically abolished since the Hannibalic war (ii. 356);but, as besides his armed retinue he was preceded by twiceas many lictors as the dictator of earlier times,* this new"dictatorship for the making of laws and the regulation ofthe commonwealth " as its official title ran was in fact alto­gether different from the earlier magistracy, which had beenlimited in point of duration and powers, had not excludedappeal.to the burgesses, and had not annulled the ordinarymagistracy. It much more resembled that of the decemvirilegibus scribundis, who likewise came forward as an extra­ordinary government with unlimited fulness of powers


* As according to reliable tradition the king himself was only attended bytwelve lictors (Cic. de Hep. ii. 17, 31; Liv. i. 8, et al.; Appian, B. C. i. 100differs) and the consuls were originally only accompanied by twelve lictorsattached to them alternately month by month, the dictatorship cannot havehad originally more lictors than twelve; and with this agrees the statement ofLivy (£t«. 98) that no dictator before Sulla had 24 lictors. As to the con­trary assertion of 1'olybius (iii. 87) we must remember that he is speaking ofa magistracy which iu his tune had been for generations in abeyauce, and that,as in his day the two consuls already appjM ^Mil!1neously with twelvelictors each, it was a natural theory that; ^h should belong to the
dictator. The circumstance that Dionys:H Hand Plutarch (Fab. 4)

There is nothing to hinder us from supposing that it was first practi­cally carried out by Sulla, and thus abiding by the certainly not groundlessstatement of Livy.

Passionate was his homageto the wine-cup, still more passionate to women; evenin his later years he was no longer the regent, when afterthe business of the day was finished he took his place attable. A vein of irony—we might perhaps say of buffoonery—pervaded his whole nature. Even when regent he gaveorders, while conducting the public sale of the property ofthe proscribed, that a donation from the spoil should begiven to the author of a wretched panegyric which washanded to him, on condition that the writer should promisenever to sing his praises again.

Yet amidst these jovialBacchanalia he lost neither bodily nor mental vigour; hewas in the rural leisure of his last years still zealouslydevoted to the chase, and the circumstance that he broughtthe writings of Aristotle from conquered Athens to Rometestifies at least to his interest in more serious reading. Thespecific peculiarities of Roman character rather repelledhim.

coteries and parties and yet not directly taking part withone or another; in a way similar to Beranger, of whomthere is much that reminds us in the political and poeticalposition of Lucilius. From this position he uttered hiscomments on public life with a sound common sense thatwas not to be shaken, with a good humour that was inex­haustible, and with a wit perpetually flowing:
Sunc rero a mane ad noctem, festo atqite profestoToto itidem pariterq»e die populusqve patresqueJaetare endoforo se omnes, decedere misquam.Uni se atque eidem studio omnes dedere et arti;Verba dare vt caute possint, pwjnare dolose,BlandHii cert ire, boman sinviiare virion seiInsidias facere vt si hostes sint omnibus omnes.
The illustrations of this inexhaustible text remorselessly,without omitting his friends or even the poet himself, as­sailed the evils of the age, the coterie-system, the endlessSpanish war-serrice, and the like. At the very commencementof his satires was a great debate in the senate of the Olym­pian gods on the question, whether Rome deserved to enjoythe continued protection of the celestials. Corporations,classes, individuals, were everywhere severally mentioned byname;-the poetry of political polemics, shut out from theBoman stage, was the true element and life-breath of theLueilian poems, which by the power of the most pungentwit illustrated with the richest imagery—a power which stillentrances us even in the remains that survive—pierce andcrush their adversary " as by a drawn sword." In this—inthe moral ascendancy and the proud consciousness of free­dom of the poet of Suessa—lies the reason why the refinedYenusian, who in the Alexandrian age of Roman poetryrevived the Lueilian satire, in spite of all his superiority informal skill with true modesty yields to the earlier poet as"his better." The language is that of a man of thoroughculture Greek and Latin, who freely indulges his humour;a poet like Lucilius, who is alleged to have made twohundred hexameters before dinner and as many after it, iain far too great a hurry to be nice; useless prolixity, slovenlyrepetition of the same turn, culpable instances of carelessnessfrequently occur; the first word, Latin or Greek, is alwaysthe best.

Italian exports and imports, that fell mainly to the Italians;at Narbo they competed in the Celtic trade with the Mas-siliots, and in general it admits of no doubt that the Romanmerchants to be met with everywhere, floating or settled,took to themselves the best share of all speculations.Capitalist Putting together these phenomena, we recognize as theoligarchy. mogfc prominent feature in the private economy of thisepoch the financial oligarchy of Roman capitalists standingalongside of, and on a par with, the political oligarchy. Intheir hands were united the rents of the soil of almost all Italyand of the best portions of the provincial territory, the pro­ceeds at usury of the capital monopolized by them, the com­mercial gain from the whole empire, and lastly, a very con­siderable part of the Roman state-revenue in the form ofprofits accruing from the lease of that revenue. The dailyincreasing accumulation of capital is evident in the rise of theaverage rate of wealth: 3,000,000 of sesterces (£30,000)was now a moderate senatorial, 2,000,000 (£20,000) adecent equestrian fortune; the property of the wealthiest131, man of the Gracchan age, Publius Crassus consul in 623.,was estimated at 100,000,000 of sesterces (£1,000,000). Itis no wonder that this capitalist order exercised a prepon­derant influence on external policy; that it destroyed out ofcommercial rivalry Carthage and Corinth (P. 24, 52) as theEtruscans had formerly destroyed Alalia and the SyracusansCaere; that it in spite of the senate upheld the colony ofNarbo (P. 171). It is likewise no wonder, that this capi­talist oligarchy engaged in earnest and often victorious com­petition with the oligarchy of the nobles in internal politics.But it is also no wonder, that ruined men of wealth putthemselves at the head of bands of revolted slaves (P. 139),and rudely reminded the public that the transition is easyfrom the haunts of fashionable debauchery to the robber'scave. It is no wonder, that that financial tower of Babel,with its foundation not purely economic but borrowed fromthe political ascendancy of Rome, tottered at every seriouspolitical crisis nearly in the same way as our very similarfabric of a paper currency.

Its leaders then determined to desist from the relief ofPraeneste and to throw themselves with all their unitedstrength on Home, which was only a good day's marchdistant. By so doing they were, in a military point ofview, ruined; their line of retreat, the Latin road, wouldby such a movement fall into Sulla's hands; and, even if theygot possession of Home, they would be infallibly crushedthere, enclosed as they would be within a city by no meansfitted for defence, and wedged in between the far superiorarmies of Metellus and Sulla. Safety, however, was nolonger thought of; revenge alone dictated this march toRome, the last outbreak of fury in the passionate revolu­tionists and especially in the despairing Sabellian nation.Pontius of Telesia was in earnest, when he called out to hisfollowers that, in order to get rid of the wolves which hadrobbed Italy of freedom, the forest in which they harbouredmust be destroyed. Never was Rome in more fearful perilthan on the 1st November, 672, when Pontius, Lam nonius,Carrinas, Damasippus advanced along the Latin road to­wards Rome, and encamped about a quarter of a mile fromthe Colline gate. It was threatened with a day like the389. 20th July, 365 v.c. or the 15th June, 455 a.d.—the daysof the Celts and the Vandals. The time was gone by whena coup de main against Rome was a foolish enterprise, andthe assailants could have no want of connections in thecapital. The band of volunteers which sallied from thecity, mostly noble youths, was scattered like chaff beforethe immense superiority of force. The only hope of safetyBattle at rested on Sulla.

They had, moreover, long agobrought the Italian allies to take part to a very great extentin war-service; but in their case too, just as among theRoman burgesses, military duty was chiefly imposed on thepropertied classes. Nevertheless the Roman military systemdown to the time of Marius rested in the main on that pri­mitive organization of the civic militia. But it was no longersuited for the altered circumstances of the state. The betterclasses of society kept aloof more and more from servicein the army, and the Boman and Italic middle class ingeneral was disappearing; while on the other hand the con­siderable military resources of the extra-Italian allies and sub­jects had become available, and the Italian proletariate also,properly applied, afforded at least a very useful material formilitary objects. The burgess-cavalry (ii. 320), which wasmeant to be formed from the class of the wealthy, had prac­tically given up service in the field even before the time ofMarius. It is last mentioned as an actual corps (TarmSe in the140.

On the other hand even before the time of Marius,especially in the cavalry and the light infantry, extra-Italian subjects—the heavy mounted troopers of Thrace, thelight African cavalry, the excellent light infantry of thenimble Ligurians, the slingers from the Baleares—were cm-ployed in daily increasing numbers even beyond their ownprovinces for the Roman armies ; and at the same time, whilethere was a want of qualified burgess-recruits, the non­

The Optimates themselves wavered, and fellinto variance with each other. While one party, with thehonourable but stubborn and shortsighted consul Octaviusat their head, perseveringly opposed all concession, themore experienced and more judicious Metellus attemptedto bring about a compromise; but his conference withCinna excited the wrath of the ultras on both sides: Cinnawas called by Marius a weakling, Metellus was called byOctavius a traitor. The soldiers, disturbed on other groundsand not without cause distrusting the leadership of theuntried Octavius, suggested to Metellus that he shouldassume the chief command, and, when he refused, began incrowds to throw away their arms or even to desert to theenemy. The temper of the burgesses became daily moredepressed and troublesome. On the proclamation of theheralds of Cinna guaranteeing freedom to the slaves whoshould desert, these flocked in troops from the capital to theenemy's camp.

the governor was bound by the provincial statute to givea native judex and to allow him to decide according tolocal usage; in most of the provinces this seems to havedepended on the pleasure of the presiding magistrate.
In the seventh century this absolute centralization of thepublic life of the Roman community in the one focus ofRome was given up, so far as Italy at least was concerned.Now that Italy was a single civic community and the civicterritory reached from the Arnus and Rubico down to theSicilian straits (P. 367), it was necessary to consent to theformation of smaller civic communities within that largerunit. So Italy was organized into communities of full bur­gesses ; on which occasion also the larger cantons that weredangerous from their size were probably broken up, sofar as this had not been done already, into several smallertown-districts (P. 234). The position of these new com­munities of full burgesses was a compromise between thatwhich had belonged to them hitherto as allied states, andthat which by the earlier law would have belonged to themas integral parts of the Roman community. Their basiswas in general the constitution of the former formallysovereign Latin community, or, so far as their constitu­tion in its principles resembled the Roman, that of theRoman old patrician-consular community; only care wastaken to apply to the same institutions in the municipiumnames different from, and inferior to, those used in the capi­tal, or, in other words, in the state. A burgess-assembly wasplaced at the head, with the prerogative of issuing municipalstatutes and nominating the municipal magistrates. A muni­cipal council of a hundred members acted the part of theRoman senate. The administration of justice was conductedby four magistrates, two regular judges corresponding to thetwo consuls, and two market-judges corresponding to thecurule aediles. The functions of the censorship, whichrecurred, as in Rome, every five years and, to all appearance,consisted chiefly in the superintendence of public buildings,were also undertaken by the supreme magistrates of thecommunity, namely the ordinary duumviri, who in this case as­sumed the distinctive title of duumviri " with censorial or quin­quennial power." The municipal funds were managed by twoquaestors. Religious functions primarily devolved on the twocolleges of men of priestly lore alone known to the earliestLatin constitution, the municipal Pontifices and Augurs.

Gracchus, who with the other men nominated toestablish it was just then selecting the colonists, appearedon the day of voting at the Capitol whither the burgesseswere convoked, with a view to procure by means of hisadherents the rejection of the law.

The consul LuciusOpimius offered the usual sacrifice in the porch of the Capito-line temple; one of the attendants assisting at the ceremony,Quintus Antullius, with the holy entrails in his hand,haughtily ordered "bad citizens" to quit the porch, andseemed as though he would lay hands on Gaius himself;whereupon a zealous Gracchan drew his sword and cut theman down. A fearful tumult arose. Gracchus vainlysought to address the people and to avert from himself theresponsibility of the sacrilegious murder; he only furnishedhis antagonists' with a fresh and formal ground of accusa­tion, as, without being aware of it in the confusion, heinterrupted a tribune in the act of speaking to the people—,an offence, for which an obsolete statute, originating at thetime of the old dissensions between the orders (i. 283), hadprescribed the severest penalty.

In a political point of view this measure was notonly without any rational object—for its financial purposemight have been attained without this bloody edict, and thenatives of Asia Minor were not to be driven into warlikezeal even by the consciousness of the most blood-stainedguilt—but even opposed to the king's designs, for on theone hand it compelled the Roman senate, so far as it was stillcapable of energy at all, to an energetic prosecution of thewar, and on the other hand it struck at not the Romansmerely, but the king's natural allies as,well, the non-RomanItalians. This Ephesian massacre was altogether a meremeaningless act of brutally bliud revenge, which obtainsa false semblance of grandeur simply through the colossalproportions in which the character of sultanic rule was heredisplayed.
The king's views altogether grew high; he had begun the Organiza-war from despair, but the unexpectedly easy victory and the tion of tllenon-arrival of the dreaded Sulla occasioned a transition to concl.uemlthe most highflown hopes.

The grandees of the empire and the king'sfavourites were loaded with rich gifts and fiefs, and not onlywere the arrears of taxes remitted, but exemption from taxa­tion for five years was promised to all the communities—ameasure which was as much a mistake as the massacre of theRomans, if the king expected thereby to secure the fidelityof the inhabitants of Asia Minor.

Withthem the Haedui (about Autun) carried on an unequalrivalry for the hegemony; while in north-eastern Gaul thekings of the Suessiones (about Soissons) united undertheir protectorate the league of the Belgic tribes extendingover to Britain. Greek travellers of that period had muchto tell of the magnificent state of Luerius, king of theArvernians—how, surrounded by his brilliant train of clans­men, his huntsmen with their pack of hounds in leash andhis band of wandering minstrels, he travelled in a silver-mounted chariot through the towns of his kingdom, scatter­ing the gold with a full hand among the multitude, andgladdening above all the heart of the minstrel with theglittering shower. The descriptions of the open table whichhe kept in an enclosure of 1500 double paces square, andto which every one who came in the way was invited,vividly remind us of the marriage-table of Camachos.

Thereupon the Arverni submitted to peace,and tranquillity was restored in the land of the Celts.*Province of The result of these military operations was the institutionNarbo. of a new Roman province between the maritime Alps andthe Pyrenees. All the tribes between the Alps and theEhone became dependent on the Romans and, so far as theydid not pay tribute to Massilia, probably became now tribu­taries of Rome. In the country between the. Rhone andthe Pyrenees the Arverni retained freedom and were notbound to pay tribute to the Romans; but they had to cedeto Rome the most southerly portion of their direct or indi­rect territory—the district to the south of the Cevennes asfar as the Mediterranean, and the upper course of theGaronne as far as Tolosa (Toulouse). As the primaryobject of these occupations was the establishment of a landcommunication between Italy and Spain, arrangements weremade immediately thereafter for the construction of the roadalong the coast. For this purpose a belt of coast from theAlps to the Rhone, from 1 to If of a mile in breadth, washanded over to the Massiliots, who already had a series ofmaritime stations along this coast, with the obligation ofkeeping the road in proper condition; while from the Rhoneto the Pyrenees the Romans themselves laid out a militaryhighway, which obtained from its originator Ahenobarbusthe name of Via Domitia.Roman set- As usual, the formation of new fortresses was combinedtlements in with the construction of roads.

A serious conflict in which he engaged the band ofSertorius, and the support which he gave to the consulOctavius when Marius had by an understanding with oneof the officers of the garrison penetrated into the Janiculum,and by which in fact the insurgents were successfullybeaten off again with much loss, showed that he was far fromintending to unite with, or rather to place himself under,the insurgent leaders.

Nothing lay further from Sulla than systematic ambition. Sulla's po-He had too much sense to regard, like the average aristocrats litica] ca-of his time, the inscription of his name in the roll of the con- reer-suls as the aim of his life; he was too indifferent and toolittle of an ideologue to be disposed voluntarily to engage inthe reform of the rotten structure of the state. He remained—where birth and culture placed him—in the circle offashionable society, and passed through the usual routine ofoffice ; he had no occasion to exert himself, and left such ex­ertion to the political working bees, of whom there was intruth no want. Thus in 647, on the distribution of the quaes- 107.torial appointments, accident brought him to Africa to thehead-quarters of Gaius Marius. The untried man-of-fashionfrom the capital was not very well received by the roughboorish general and his experienced staff. Provoked by thisreception Sulla, fearless and skilful as he was, rapidly madehimself master of the profession of arms, and in his daringexpedition to Mauretania first displayed that peculiar com­bination of audacjty and cunning, with reference to whichhis contemporaries said of him, that he was half lion halffox and that the fox in him was more dangerous than thelion. To the young, highborn, brilliant officer, who wasconfessedly the real means of ending the vexatious Nu-midian war, the most splendid career now lay open: he tookpart also in the Cimbrian war, and manifested his singulartalent for organization in the management of the difficulttask of providing supplies; nevertheless the pleasures ofthe capital still had more attraction for him than war oreven politics. During his praetorship, which office he heldin 661 after having failed in a previous candidature, it once 93.more chanced that in his province, the least important ofall, the first victory over king Mithradates and the firsttreaty with the mighty Arsacids, as well as their first humi­liation, occurred.

The scheme had beenat that time frustrated by the resistance of Scipio; someyears later, apparently after his death, the law passed. Theprincipal object of the party, however, was to revive the actionof the allotment-commission which had been practicallysuspended; the leaders seriously talked of removing theobstacles which the Italian allies interposed to the schemeby conferring on them the rights of citizenship, and theagitation assumed mainly that direction. In order to meet126. it, the senate in 628 got the tribune of the people MarcusJunius Pennus to propose the dismissal of all non-bur­gesses from the capital, and in spite of the resistance of thedemocrats, particularly of Gaius Gracchus, and of the fer­ment occasioned by this odious measure in the Latin communities, the proposal was carried. Marcus Fulvius Flaccus125. retorted in the following year (629) as consul with the pro­posal, that every ally should be allowed to ask for Romancitizenship and to get a vote of the comitia on his request.But he stood almost alone. Carbo had meanwhile changedhis colours and was now a zealous aristocrat; Gaius Grac­chus was absent as quaestor in Sardinia. The project wasfrustrated by the resistance not of the senate merely, but alsoof the burgesses, who were but little inclined to extendtheir privileges to a still wider circle.

The citizens had not only to sendannual tribute to the court-camp of the barbarian king, butalso to make him a gift when he encamped before the townor even simply passed by, and in a similar way to buy offminor chieftains and in fact sometimes the whole horde withpresents; and it fared ill with them if the gift appeared toosmall. The treasury of the town was bankrupt and theyhad to pledge the votive offerings. Meanwhile the tribes werethronging without in front of the gates; the territory waslaid waste, the field-labourers were dragged away en masse,and, what was worst of all, the weaker of their barbarianneighbours, the Scythians, sought, in order to shelter them­selves from the pressure of the more savage Celts, to obtainpossession of the walled town, so that numerous citizenswere leaving it and the inhabitants now contemplated itsentire surrender.

No wonder that everywhere, as had already beenthe case in Dioscurias, the Hellenes received the king of Pon-tiis with open arms and regarded the half-Hellene and hisCappadocians armed in Greek fashion as their deliverers.What Kome had here neglected, became apparent. Thedemands on the rulers of Pauticapaeum for tribute had justthen been raised to an exorbitant height; the town of Cher-sonesus found itself hard pressed by Scilurus king of theTauric Scythians and his fifty sons; the former were gladto surrender their hereditary lordship, and the latter theirlong-preserved freedom, in order to save their last possession,their Hellenism.

Whether Marius' appearance wouldbe the immediate prelude of a new attempt to supersede theoligarchy by the tyrannis, or whether it would, as in varioussimilar cases, pass away without further consequence as anisolated encroachment on the prerogative of the government,could not yet be determined; but it could well be foreseenthat, if. these rudiments of a second tyrannis should attainany development, it was not a statesman like GaiusGracchus, but an officer that would become its head. Thecontemporary reorganization of the military system—whichMarius introduced when, in forming his army destined forAfrica, he disregarded the property-qualification hithertorequired, and allowed even the poorest burgess, if he wasotherwise serviceable, to enter the legion as a volunteer—may have been projected by its author on purely militarygrounds; but it was none the less on that account a moment­ous political event, that the army was no longer, as formerly,composed of those who had much, no longer even, as in themost recent times, composed of those who had something, tolose, but became gradually converted into a host of peoplewho had nothing but their arms and what the general be­stowed on them.

land had operated beneficially—giving help to many of thesufferers and hope to all. But after the founding of Luna
177. (677) no trace of further assignations of land is to be metwith for a long time, with the exception of the isolatedinstitution of the Picenian colony of Auximum (Osimo) in
157. 597. The reason is simple. After the conquest of theBoii and Apuani no new territory was acquired in Italy ex­cepting the far from attractive Ligurian valleys; therefore noother land existed for distribution there except the leased oroccupied domainland, the laying hands on which was, as mayeasily be conceived, just as little agreeable to the aristocracynow as it was three hundred years before. The distributionof the territory acquired out of Italy appeared for politicalreasons inadmissible; Italy was to remain the rulingcountry, and the wall of partition between the Italianmasters and their provincial servants was not to be brokendown. Unless the government were willing to disregardconsiderations of higher policy or even the interests of theirorder, no course was left to them but to remain spectatorsof the ruin of the Italian farmer-class; and this resultaccordingly ensued. The capitalists continued to buy outthe small landholders, or indeed, if they remained obstinate,to seize their fields without title of purchase; in which case, asmay be supposed, matters were not always amicably settled.A peculiarly favourite method was to eject the wife and chil­dren of the farmer from the homestead, while he was in thefield, and to bring him to compliance by means of the theoryof " accomplished fact." The landlords continued mainly toemploy slaves instead of free labourers, because the formercould not like the latter be called away to military service;and thus reduced the free proletariate to the same level of'misery with the slaves. They continued to supersedeItalian grain in the market of the capital, and to lessen itsvalue over the whole peninsula, by selling Sicilian slave-cornat a mere nominal price. In Etruria the old native aristo­cracy in league with the Roman capitalists had as early as
134. 620 brought matters to such a pass, that there was no longera free farmer there. It could be said aloud in the market ofthe capital, that the wild beasts had their lairs but nothingwas left to the burgesses save the air and sunshine, and thatthose who were called the masters of the world had nolonger a clod that they could call their own.

simply undertook to defray the military expenses from theircoffers. But even of this military budget considerable itemswere devolved on the communities—such as the expense ofmaking and maintaining the non-Italian military roads, thecosts of the fleets in the non-Italian seas, nay even in greatpart the outlay for the army, inasmuch as the forces of theclient-states as well as those of the subjects were regularlyliable to serve at the expense of their communities withintheir province, and began to be employed with increasingfrequency even beyond it—Thracians in Africa, Africans iuItaly, and so on—at the discretion of the Romans (P. 200).If the provinces only and not Italy paid direct taxes to thegovernment, this was equitable in a financial, if not in a,political, aspect so long as Italy alone bore the burdens andexpense of the military system; but from the time thatthis system was abandoned, the provincials were, in a financialpoint of view, decidedly overburdened.Extortions. Lastly we must not forget the great chapter of injustice,by which in manifold ways the Roman magistrates andfarmers of the revenue augmented the burden of taxationon the provinces. Every present which the governortook might be treated legally as an exaction, and even hisright of purchase might be restricted by law; neverthelessthe exercise of his public functions offered to him, if he wasdisposed to do wrong, ample pretexts for doing so. Thequartering of the troops; the free lodging of the magistratesand of the host of adjutants of senatorial or equestrianrank, of clerks, lictors, heralds, physicians, and priests; theright which the messengers of the state had to be forwardedfree of cost; the approval of, and providing transport for, thesupplies payable in kind; above all the forced sales and therequisitions — gave all magistrates opportunity to bringhome princely fortunes from the provinces. And the plun­dering became daily more general, the more that the controlof the government appeared to be worthless and that ofthe capitalist-courts to be dangerous in reality to the uprightmagistrate alone. The institution of a standing commissionregarding the exactions of magistrates in the provinces, oc­casioned by the frequency of complaints as to such cases, in149. 605 (P. 73), and the laws as to extortion following eachother so rapidly and constantly augmenting its penalties,show the daily increasing height of the evil, as the Nilometershows the rise of the flood.

The brilliant magnificence of hisaedilician games, not produced without oppressing the de­pendent communities, had drawn upon him the severe anddeserved censure of the senate (ii. 338); his interference inthe pitiful process directed against the Scipios who werepersonally hostile to him (ii. 283) gave proof of his chival­rous feeling, and perhaps also of his regard for his ownorder; and his energetic action against the freedmen in hiscensorship (ii. 354) evinced his conservative disposition.As governor, moreover, of the province of the Ebro (ii.2, 11), by his bravery and, above all, by his integrity he ren­dered a permanent service to his country, and at the sametime raised to himself in the hearts of the subject nation anenduring monument of reverence and affection.
His mother Cornelia was the daughter of the conquerorof Zama, who, simply on account of that generous interven­tion, had chosen his former opponent as a son-in-law; sheherself was a highly cultivated and notable woman, whoafter the death of her much older husband had refused thehand of the king of Egypt, and reared her three survivingchildren in memory of her husband and her father. Tiberius,the elder of the two sons, was of a good and moral disposi­tion, of gentle aspect and quiet temper, apparently fittedfor anything rather than for an agitator of the masses. Inall his relations and views he belonged to the Scipioniccircle, whose refined and thorough culture, Greek andnational, he and his brother and sister shared. ScipiojEmilianus was at once his cousin and his sister's husband;under him Tiberius, at the age of eighteen, had taken part inthe storming of Carthage, and had by his valour acquiredthe commendation of the stern general and warlike distinc­tions. It was natural that the able young man should,adopt and develop, with all the animation and all the rigidconsistency of youth, the views as to the decay of the state inall its parts, which were prevalent in that circle, and more es­pecially their ideas as to the elevation of the Italian farmers.Nor was it to the young men alone that the shrinking ofLaelius from the execution of his ideas of reform seemed tobe not judicious, but weak.

In fact ifGracchus, as his words and still more his works plainlytestify, aimed at the overthrow of the government of thesenate, what other political organization but the Tyranniaremained possible, after overthrowing the aristocraticgovernment, in a commonwealth which had outgrowncollective assemblies and had no knowledge of parliamen­tary government? Dreamers such as was his predecessor,and knaves such as after times produced, might call this inquestion; but Gaius Gracchus was a statesman, and thoughthe formal shape, which that great man had projected for hisgreat work, has not been handed down to us and may beconceived of very variously, yet he was beyond doubt awareof what he was doing. But while the intention of usurp­ing monarchical power can scarcely be mistaken, thosewho survey the whole circumstances will scarcely blameGracchus for it. An absolute monarchy is a great misfor­tune for a nation, but it is a less misfortune than anabsolute oligarchy; and history cannot censure one whoimposes on a nation the lesser suffering instead of thegreater, least of all in the case of a nature so vehementlyearnest and so far aloof from all that is vulgar as was thatof Gaius Gracchus. Nevertheless it may not conceal thefact that his whole legislation was pervaded in the mostpernicious way by conflicting aims, inasmuch as on the onehand it aimed at the public good, and on the other handministered to the personal objects and in fact the personalvengeance of the ruler. Gracchus earnestly laboured tofind a remedy for social evils, and to check the spread ofpauperism ; yet he at the same time intentionally reared upa street proletariate of the worst kind in the capital by hisdistributions of corn, which were designed to be, andbecame, a premium to all the lazy and hungry civic rabble.Gracchus censured in the bitterest terms the venality of thesenate, and in particular laid bare with unsparing and justseverity the scandalous traffic which Manius Aquillius haddriven with the provinces of Asia Minor ;* yet it was through

But, as the Cimbrians continued to employ themselveselsewhere, and the Helvetii did not further molest for themoment the Roman province, the new Roman comman­der-in-chief, Quintus Servilius Caepio, had full time to re­cover possession of the town of Tolosa by treachery and toempty at leisure the immense treasures accumulated in theold and famous sanctuary of the Celtic Apollo. It was a de­sirable gain for the embarrassed exchequer, but unfortunatelythe gold and silver vessels on the way from Tolosa to Mas-silia were taken from the weak escort by a band of robbers,and totally disappeared: the consul himself and his staffwere, it was alleged, the instigators of the onset (648). 106-Meanwhile they confined themselves to the strictest defen­sive as regarded the chief enemy, and guarded the Romanprovince with three strong armies, till it should please theCimbrians to repeat their attack.

We may regard as an appendix to these criminal laws thepolice ordinances, by which Sulla, putting the law in roomof the censor, again enforced good discipline and strictmanners, and, by establishing new maximum rates instead ofthe old ones which had long been antiquated, attempted torestrain luxury at banquets, funerals, and otherwise.The Roman Lastly, the development of an independent Roman muni-muiiicipal cipai system was the work, if not of Sulla, at any rate of thei,ys cm. Sullaii epoch. The idea of organically incorporating thecommunity as a subordinate political unit in the higherunity of the state was originally foreign to antiquity; cityand state were throughout the Helleno-Italic worldnecessarily coincident, and it was otherwise only underOriental despotism. In so far there was no proper muni­cipal system originally either in Greece or in Italy. TheRoman policy, in particular, adhered to this view with itspeculiar tenacious consistency; still in the sixth century thedependent communities of Italy were either, in order to theirkeeping their municipal constitution, constituted as formallysovereign states of non-burgesses, or, if they obtained theRoman franchise, were—although not prevented from organ­izing themselves as commonwealths—deprived of strictlymunicipal rights, so that in all burgess-colonies and burgess-municipia even the administration of justice and the chargeof buildings devolved on the Roman praetors and censors.The utmost to which Rome consented was to allow at least themost urgent law-suits to be settled on the spot by a deputy(proefectus) of the prator nominated from Rome (i. 434). Theprovinces were similarly dealt with, except that the governorthere came in place of the authorities of the capital. In thefree, that is, formally sovereign cities the civil and criminaljurisdiction was administered by the municipal magistratesaccording to the local statutes; only, unless altogether spe­cial privileges stood in the way, every Roman might eitheras defendant or as plaintiff request to have his cause de­cided before Italian judges according to Italian law.

In the course of the seventh century therewere gradually added to the six special departments alreadyexisting six others, viz. the five new governorships of Mace­donia, Africa, Asia, Narbo, and Cilicia, and the presidency ofthe standing commission respecting exactions (P. 73). Withthe daily extending sphere of action of the Roman govern­ment, moreover, it was a case of more and more frequentoccurrence, that the supreme magistrates were called toundertake extraordinary military or judicial commissions.Nevertheless the number of the ordinary supreme annualmagistrates was not enlarged; and there thus devolved oneight magistrates to be annually nominated—apart fromemergencies — at least twelve special departments to beannually occupied. Of course it was no mere accident,that this deficiency was not covered once for all by thecreation of new praetorships. According to the letter ofthe> constitution all the supreme magistrates were to benominated annually by the burgesses; according to the neworder or rather disorder—under which the vacancies thatarose were filled up mainly by prolonging the term of office,and a second year was as a rule added by the senate to themagistrates legally serving for one year, but might also atdiscretion be refused—the most important and most lucrativeplaces in the state were filled up no longer by the burgesses,but by the senate out of a list of competitors formed by theburgess elections.

seemed to the regent necessary carefully to preserve theirnames, he was still more careful to prevent any real activityon their part. Sulla dealt even with the franchise itself inthe most contemptuous manner; he made no difficultyeither in conceding it to the new burgess-communities, orin bestowing it on Spaniards and Celts en masse; in fact,probably not without design, no steps were taken at allfor the adjustment of the burgess-roll, which neverthelessafter so violent revolutions stood in urgent need of a revi­sion, if the government was at all in earnest with the legalprivileges attaching to it. The legislative functions of thecomitia, however, were not directly restricted; there was noneed in fact for doing so, for in consequence of the betterBecured initiative of the senate the people could not readilyagainst the will of the government intermeddle with admi­nistration, finance, or criminal jurisdiction, and its legisla­tive co-operation was once more reduced in substance to theright of giving assent to alterations of the constitution.
Of greater moment was the participation of the bur­gesses in the elections—a participation which, apparently,could not be dispensed with without disturbing more thanCo-optation Sulla's superficial restoration could or would disturb. Therestored in interferences of the movement party in the sacerdotal elec-

In the case of elections to the magistra­cies the mode hitherto pursued was on the whole retained; ex­cept in so far as the new regulation of the military commandto be mentioned immediately certainly involved as its con­sequence a material restriction of the powers of the bur­gesses, and indeed in some measure transferred the right ofbestowing the appointment of generals from the burgessesto the senate. It does not even appear that Sulla now re­sumed the previously attempted restoration of the Servianvoting-arrangement (P. 267); whether it was that he re­garded the particular composition of the voting-divisions asaltogether a matter of indifference, or whether it was thatthat older arrangement seemed to him to augment the dan­gerous influence of the capitalists.

data; qui pollioiti mult[a] milia miiitum vix XV . . . cohortes miserunt; astatement in which Livy s account (Epit. 80): Italicis popuiis a senatu ciri-tas data est reappears in a somewhat more precise shape. The dediticii wereaccording to Roman state-law those peregrini liberi (Gaius i. 13—15, 25, Ulp.20, 14, 22, 2), who had become subject to the Romans and had not been ad­mitted to alliance. They might retain life, liberty, and property, and mightbe formed into communities with a constitution of their own; the freedmenwho were by legal fiction placed on the same footing with the dediticii (u quidediticiorum numero sunt, only by erroneous usage and rarely by the betterauthors called directly dediticii; Gai. i. 12, Ulp. i. 14, Paul. iv. 12, 6) aswell as the kindred liberti Latini Juniani, were probably diro'AiSe?, nulhuscertae civitatis cives (Ulp. 20,14; comp. Dig. 48, 19, 17, 1); but neither theLatins nor the dediticii themselves were necessarily diro'Aio'e?. The latter never­theless were destitute of rights as respected the Roman state, in so far as by Romanstate-law every deditio was necessarily unconditional (Polyb. xxi. 1; comp. xx.9, 10, xxxvi. 2) and all the privileges expressly or tacitly conceded to themwere conceded only precario and therefore revocable at pleasure (Appian,Hisp. 44); so that the Roman state, whatever it might immediately or after­wards decree regarding its dediticii, could never perpetrate as respected them aviolation of rights. This destitution of rights only ceased on the conclusionof a treaty of alliance (Liv. xxxiv, 57). Accordingly deditio and f&dus appearin constitutional law as contrasted terms excluding each other (Liv. iv. 30, xxviii.34: Cod. Theod. 7, 13, 16 and Gothofr. thereon), and of precisely the samenature is the distinction current among the jurists between the quasidediticiiand the quasiLatini, for the Latins are just the faderati eminently so called(Cic. pro BaVi. 24, 54). -
According to the older constitutional law there were, with the exception ofthe not numerous communities that were declared to have forfeited their treatiesin consequence of the Hannibalic war (ii. 332), no Italian dediticii; in the90-89. Plautio-Papirian law of 664—5 the description: qui fcederatis civitatibus ad-scriptifuerunt (Cic. pro Arch. 4, 7) still included in substance all Italians.87. But as the dediticii who received the franchise supplementally in 667 cannot
reasonably be understood as embracing merely the Bruttii and Piceotes, wemay assume that all the insurgents, so tar as they had laid down their armsand had not acquired the franchise under the Plautio-Papirian law, weretreated as dediticii, or—which is the same thing—that the treaties cancelled asa matter of course by the insurrection (hence qui faderati fuerunt in the pas­sage of Cicero cited) were not legally renewed to them on their surrender.

democracy, since the power of the oligarchy mainly restedon their free control over the provinces and was endangeredby any permanent military command; the ideas of equalizingItaly and the provinces and of making conquests beyondthe Alps were not compatible with conservative principles.But the senate might very well sacrifice the Latin and eventhe Campanian domains as well as Sicily in order to raisethe Italian farmer class, and yet retain the government asbefore; to which fell to be added the consideration, thatthey could not more effectually obviate future agitationsthan by providing that all the land at all disposable shouldbe brought to distribution by the aristocracy itself, and thataccording to Drusus' own expression, nothing should be leftfor future demagogues to distribute but "the dirt and thedaylight." In like manner it was for the government—whether that might be a monarch, or a close number of rulingfamilies—very much a matter of indifference, whether thehalf or the whole of Italy possessed the Roman franchise;and hence the reforming men on both sides probably couldnot but light upon the idea of averting the danger of arecurrence of the insurrection of Fregellae on a larger scaleby a judicious and reasonable extension of the franchise, andof seeking allies, moreover, for their plans in the numerousand influential Italians. While in the question of theheadship of the state the views and designs of the two greatpolitical parties were palpably different, the best men of bothcamps had many points of contact in their means of opera­tion and in their reforming tendencies ; and, as Scipio iEmi-lianus may be named alike among the adversaries of TiberiusGracchus and among the promoters of his reforming efforts,so Drusus was the successor and disciple no less than theantagonist of Gaius. The two high-born and high-mindedyouthful reformers had a greater resemblance than wasapparent at the first glance; and, personally also, the twowere not unworthy to meet, as respects the substance oftheir patriotic endeavours, in purer and higher views abovethe obscuring mists of prejudiced partisanship.
The question at stake was the passing of the laws drawn Discussionsup by Drusus. Among these the proposer, just like Gaius on the Li-Gracchus, kept in reserve for the moment the hazardous Tian laws-proposal to confer the Roman franchise on the Italian allies,and brought forward at first only the laws as to the jury­men, the assignation of land, and the distribution of grain.

orders political factions had without exception been unitedin opposing the public foe; but Romans of note foughtunder the standards of Mithradates, large districts of Italydesired to enter into alliance with him, and it was at leastdoubtful whether the democratic party would follow theglorious example that Sulla had set before it, and keep trucewith him so long as he was fighting against the Asiaticking. But the vigorous general, who had to contend withall these embarrassments, was not accustomed to trouble him­self about more remote dangers before finishing the task im­mediately in hand. When his proposals of peace addressedto the king, which substantially amounted to a restorationof the state of matters before the war, met with no accept­ance, he advanced, just as he had landed, from the harboursof Epirus to Boeotia, defeated the generals of the enemy Greece oc-Archelaus and Aristion there at Mount Tilphossium, and copied,after that victory possessed himself almost without resist­ance of the whole Grecian mainland with the exception ofthe fortresses of Athens and the Piraeeus, into which Aristionand Archelaus had thrown themselves, and which he failedto carry by a coup de main. A Roman division under LuciusHortensius occupied Thessaly and made incursions intoMacedonia; another under Munatius stationed itself beforeChalcis, to keep off the enemy's corps under Neoptolemusin Eubcea; Sulla himself formed a camp at Eleusis and Me-gara, from which he commanded Greece and the Pelopon­nesus, and prosecuted the siege of the city and harbour ofAthens. The Hellenic cities, governed as they always wereby their immediate fears, submitted unconditionally to theRomans, and were glad when they were allowed to ransomthemselves from more severe punishment by supplying pro­visions and men and paying fines.
The sieges in Attica advanced less rapidly. Sulla found Protractedhimself compelled to prepare all sorts of heavy besieging siege ofimplements, for which the trees of the Academy and the f}b^!s andLyceum had to supply the timber. Archelaus conductedthe defence with equal vigour and judgment; he armed thecrews of his vessels, and thus reinforced repelled the attacksof the Romans with superior strength and made frequentand not seldom successful sorties.

Withoutdelay the consul started, and forming a junction with hislike-minded colleague by the way, he arrived by quickmarches—little troubling himself about the deputies whohastened from Bome to meet and attempted to detain him—beneath the walls of the capital. Suddenly the Romansbeheld columns of Sulla's army take their station at thebridge over the Tiber and at the Colline and Esquiline gates,and then two legions marching in battle array, with theirstandards at their head, crossed the sacred boundary withinwhich the law had forbidden war to enter. Many a worsequarrel, many an important feud had been brought to asettlement within those walls, without a Roman army ven­turing to break the sacred fence of the city; that step wasnow taken, primarily for the sake of the miserable questionwhether this or that officer was called to command in theEast. The entering legions advanced as far as the height Romeof the Esquiline; when the missiles and stones descending occupied.in showers from the roofs made the soldiers waver and theybegan to give way, Sulla brandished a blazing torch, andwith firebrands and threats of setting the houses on firethe legions cleared their way to the Esquiline Forum (notfar from S. Maria Maggiore). There the force hastily col­lected by Marius and Sulpicius awaited them, and by itsBuperior numbers repelled the first advancing columns. Butreinforcements came up from the gates; another division ofthe Sullans made preparations for turning the defenders bythe street of the Subura; the latter were obliged to retire.At the temple of Tellus, where the Esquiline begins to slopetowards the great Forum, Marius attempted once more tomake a stand ; he adjured the senate andequites and all thecitizens to throw themselves across the path of the legions;it was in vain. Even when the slaves were summoned to armunder the promise of freedom, not more than three of themappeared. Nothing remained for the leaders but to escapein all haste through the still unoccupied gates; after a fewhours Sulla was absolute master of Rome.

man of note belonging to the party of Crassus and Drususwho had come forth uninjured from the storm of the Varianprosecutions, he felt himself called on to complete the work ofDrusus and finally to abolish the still subsisting disabilitiesof the new burgesses—for which purpose he needed thetribunate. Several acts of his even during his tribunesbipare mentioned, which betray the very opposite of demagogicdesigns. For instance, he prevented by his veto one of hiscolleagues from cancelling through a decree of the people thesentences of jurymen issued under the Varian law; and whenthe late aedile Gaius Caesar unconstitutionally became a can­didate for the consulship, passing over the praetorship withthe design, it was alleged, of getting the charge of the Asiaticwar afterwards intrusted to him, Sulpicius opposed himmore resolutely and sharply than any one else. Entirely inthe spirit of Drusus, he thus required from himself and fromothers primarily and especially the maintenance of the con­stitution. But in fact he was as little able as was Drususto reconcile things that were incompatible, and to carry outin strict form of law the change of the constitution whichhe had in view—a change judicious in itself, but never to beobtained from the great majority of the old burgesses byamicable means. His breach with the powerful family ofthe Julii—among whom the consular Lucius Caesar, thebrother of Gaius, in particular was very influential in thesenate—and with the section of the aristocracy adhering toit, beyond doubt materially co-operated and carried theirascible man through personal exasperation beyond hisoriginal design. Yet the proposals brought in by him wereof such a nature, as to be by no means out of keeping withthe personal character and the previous party-position ofTendency of their author. The equalization of the new burgesses withthese laws- the old was simply a partial resumption of the proposalsdrawn up by Drusus in favour of the Italians and, likethese, only a carrying out of the requirements of a soundpolicy. The recall of those condemned by the Varian jury­men no doubt Sacrificed the principle of the inviolabilityof such decisions, which Sulpicius himself had just practi­cally defended; but it tended mainly to benefit in the firstinstance the members of the proposer's own party, themoderate conservatives, and it may be very well conceivedthat so impetuous a man might when first coming forwarddecidedly combat such a measure and then, indignant at the

valley of the Isere, which had come at the request of thefugitive king of the Salyes, Tutomotulus, to help him toreconquer his land, but was defeated in the district of Aix.When the Allobroges nevertheless refused to surrender theking of the Salyes, Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, the suc­cessor of Calvinus, penetrated into their own territory(632). Up to this period the leading Celtic tribe had beenspectators of the encroachments of their Italian neighbours;the Arvernian king Betuitus, son of the Luerius alreadymentioned, seemed not much inclined to enter on a danger­ous war for the sake of the loose relation of dependence inwhich the eastern cantons might stand to him. But whenthe Romans showed signs of attacking the Allobroges intheir own territory, he offered his mediation, the rejectionof which was followed by his taking the field with all hisforces to help the Allobroges; whereas the Haedui embracedthe side of the Romans. On receiving accounts of therising of the Arverni, the Romans sent the consul of 633,Quintus Fabius Maximus, to meet in concert with Aheno­barbus the impending attack. On the southern border ofthe canton of the Allobroges at the confluence of the Iserewith the Rhone, on the 8th of August 633, the battle was 121.fought which decided the mastery of southern Gaul. KingBetuitus, when he saw the innumerable hosts of his depend­ent clans march over to him on the bridge of boats con­structed over the Rhone and the Romans who had not a thirdof their numbers form in array against them, is said to haveexclaimed that there were not enough of the latter to satisfythe dogs of the Celtic army. Nevertheless Maximus, agrandson of the victor of Pydna, achieved a decisive victory;the bridge of boats broke down under the mass of the fugi­tives ; the greater part of the Arvernian army was destroyed.The Allobroges, to whom the king of the Arverni declaredhimself unable to render further assistance, and whom headvised to make their peace with Maximus, submitted tothe consul; whereupon the latter, thenceforth called Allo-brogicus, returned to Italy and left to Ahenobarbus the nolonger distant termination of the Arvernian war. Aheno-'barbus, personally exasperated at king Betuitus becausehe had induced the Allobroges to surrender to Maxinrasand not to him, possessed himself treacherously of theperson of the king and sent him to Rome, where the senate,although disapproving the breach of fidelity, not only kept

the previous epoch was now completed also in the sphere ofeducation and culture. We have already shown how thefundamental idea of the Roman system—civil equality—hadalready during the sixth century begun to be underminedin this field also. Even in the time of Pictor and CatoGreek culture was widely diffused in Rome, and there wasa native Roman culture; but neither of them had thengot beyond the initial stage. Cato's encyclopaedia showstolerably what was understood at this period by a Romano-Greek model training (ii. 468); it was little more than anembodiment of the old Roman household knowledge, andtruly, when compared with the Hellenic culture of theperiod, scanty enough. At how low a stage the averageinstruction of youth in Rome still stood at the beginning ofthe seventh century, may be inferred from the expressionsof Polybius, who in this one respect prominently censuresthe criminal indifference of the Romans as compared withthe intelligent private and public care of his countrymen;no Hellene, not even Polybius himself, could rightly under­stand the deeper idea of civil equality that lay at the root ofthis indifference.
Now the case was altered. Just as the naive popularfaith was superseded by an enlightened Stoical super-naturalism, so in education alongside of the simple popularinstruction a special training, an exclusive humamias, de­veloped itself and eradicated the last remnants of the oldsocial equality. It will not be superfluous to cast a glanceat the aspect assumed by the new instruction of the young,both the Greek and the higher Latin.
It was a singular circumstance that the same man, who Greek in-in a political point of view definitively vanquished the struction.Hellenic nation, Lucius JEmilius Paullus, was at the sametime the first or one of the first who fully recognized theHellenic civilization as—what it has thenceforth continuedto be beyond dispute—the civilization of the ancient world.He himself no doubt was an old man, before it was grantedto him, with the Homeric poems in his mind, to stand beforethe Zeus of Phidias; but his heart was young enough tocarry home the full sunshine of Hellenic beauty and theunconquerable longing after the golden apples of theHesperides in his soul ; poets and artists had found in theforeigner a more earnest and cordial devotee than was anyof the wise men of the Greece of those days.

To procure a wider approach, Scipio gave ordersto set fire to the captured streets and to level the ruins; onwhich occasion a number of persons unable to fight, whowere concealed in the houses, miserably perished. Then atlast the remnant of the population, crowded together in thecitadel, besought for mercy. Life was barely conceded tothem, and they appeared before the victor, 30,000 men and25,000 women, not the tenth part of the former population.The Roman deserters alone, 900 in number, and the generalHasdrubal with his wife and his two children had thrownthemselves into the temple of the God of Healing; for them—for soldiers who had deserted their posts, and for the murdererof the Roman prisoners—there were no terms. But, when,yielding to famine, the most resolute of them set fire to thetemple, Hasdrubal could not endure to face death; alone heran forth to the victor and falling upon his knees pleaded forhis life. It was granted; but, when his wife who with herchildren was among the rest on the roof of the temple sawhim at the feet of Scipio, her proud heart swelled at thisdisgrace brought on her beloved perishing home, and, withbitter words bidding her husband be careful to save his life,she plunged first her sons and then herself into the names.The struggle was at an end. The joy in the camp and atRome was boundless; the noblest of the Romans alone werein secret ashamed of the most recent achievement of thenation. The prisoners were mostly sold as slaves; severalwere allowed to languish in prison; the most notable,Hasdrubal and Bithyas, were sent to the interior of Italy asRoman state-prisoners and tolerably treated. The moveableproperty, with the exception of gold, silver, and votivegifts, was abandoned to the pillage of the soldiers. As to thetemple treasures, the booty that had been in better timescarried off by the Carthaginians from the Sicilian towns wasrestored; the bull of Phalaris, for example, was returned tothe Agrigentines; the rest fell to the Roman state.

for one burgess. In like manner with this military supre­macy the civil superintendence, which (including the su­preme administrative jurisdiction which could hardly beseparated from it) the Eoman government had always andrightly reserved to itself over the dependent Italian communi­ties, was extended in such a way that the Italians were hardlyless than the provincials abandoned without protection tothe caprice of any one of the numberless Roman magis­trates. In Teanum Sidicinum, one of the most considerableof the allied towns, a consul had ordered the chief magis­trate of the town to be scourged with rods at the stake inthe market-place, because, on the consul's wife expressing adesire to bathe in the men's bath, the municipal officers hadnot driven forth the bathers quickly enough, and the bathappeared to her not to be clean. Similar scenes had takenplace in Ferentinum, likewise a town optimi juris, and evenin the old and important Latin colony of Cales. In theLatin colony of Venusia a free peasant had been seized by ayoung Roman diplomatist not holding office but passingthrough the town, on account of a jest which he had allowedhimself to make on the Roman's litter, had been thrown down,and whipped to death with the straps of the litter. Theseoccurrences are incidentally mentioned about the time of theFregellan insurrection; it admits of no doubt that similaroutrages frequently occurred, and of as little that no realsatisfaction for such misdeeds could anywhere be obtained,whereas the right of appeal—not easily violated with impunity—protected in some measure the life and limbs of the Eomanburgess. In consequence of this treatment of the Italianson the part of the Roman government, the variance, whichthe wisdom of their ancestors had carefully fostered betweenthe Latin and the other Italian communities, could not fail, ifriot to disappear, at any rate to undergo abatement (ii. 335).The fortresses of Rome and the districts kept to their allegiance by the fortresses lived now under the like oppression;the Latin could remind the Picentine that they were bothin like manner "subject to the fasces;" the overseers andthe slaves of former days were now united by a commonhatred towards the common despot.
While the present state of the Italian allies was thustransformed from an endurable dependence into the mostoppressive bondage, they were at the same time deprived ofevery prospect of obtaining better rights. With the subju­

.with the mass of their party. They had also observed thatthe most gifted, most energetic, and most celebrated states­men of Rome had found themselves, at the very momentwhen they came forward as advocates of the Italians, desertedby their own adherents and had been accordingly overthrown.In all the vicissitudes of the thirty years of revolution andrestoration governments enough had been installed and de­posed, but, however the programme might vary, a short­sighted and narrow-minded spirit sat always at the helm.
Above all, the recent occurrences had clearly shown The Italian;how vain was the expectation of the Italians that their *""•the oll-claims would be attended to by Rome. So long as the de- S^^i'-mands of the Italians were mixed up with those of the revo­lutionary party and had in the hands of the latter beenrejected by the folly of the -masses, they might still resignthemselves to the belief that the oligarchy had been hostilemerely to the proposers, not to the proposal itself, and thatthere was still a possibility that the more intelligent senatewould accept a measure which was compatible with the natureof the oligarchy and salutary for the state. But the recentyears, in which the senate once more ruled almost abso­lutely, had shed only too disagreeable a light on the designsof the Roman oligarchy also. Instead of the expected mo­difications, there was issued in 659 a consular law which most 95.strictly prohibited the non-burgesses from laying claim to The Liciniothe franchise and threatened transgressors with. trial and Mucianpunishment—a law, which threw back a large number of aw'most respectable persons who were deeply interested in thequestion of equalization from the ranks of Romans into thoseof the Italians, and which in point of indisputable legalityand of political folly stands completely on a parallel withthat famous act which laid the foundation for the separa­tion of North America from the mother-country; in factit became, just like that act, the proximate cause of thecivil war. It was only so much the worse, that the authorsof this law by no means belonged to the obstinate and incor­rigible Optimates; they were no other than the sagacious anduniversally honoured Quintus Scaevola—destined like GeorgeGrenville by nature to be a jurist and by fate to be astatesman, who by his equally honourable and pernicious rec­titude inflamed more than any one else first the war betweensenate and equites and then that between Romans andItalians — and the orator Lucius Crassus, the friend and

preme command in it was to be committed. With an un­prejudiced treatment of the matter it was not difficult tomake a fitting choice. Rome was no doubt, in comparisonwith earlier times, not rich in military notabilities; yetQuintus Maximus had commanded with distinction in Gaul,Marcus .SSmilius Scaurus and Marcus Minucius in theregions of the Danube, Quintus Metellus, Publius RutiliusRufus, Gaius Marius in Africa; and the object proposedwas not to defeat a Pyrrhus or a Hannibal, but again to makegood the often tried superiority of Roman arms and Romantactics in opposition to the barbarians of the north—anobject which required no hero, but merely a stern and ablesoldier. But it was precisely a time, when anything waspracticable rather than the unprejudiced settlement of a ques­tion of administration. The government was, as it couldnot but be and as the Jugurthine war had already shown,so utterly bankrupt in public opinion, that its ablest generalshad to retire in the full career of victory, whenever itoccurred to an officer of mark to vilify them before thepeople and to get himself as the candidate of the oppositionappointed to the head of affairs. It was no wonder, thatwhat took place after the victories of Metellus was repeatedon a greater scale after the defeats of Gnaeus Mallius andQuintus Caepio. Once more Gaius Marius came forward,in spite of the law which prohibited the holding of the con­sulship more than once, as a candidate for the suprememagistracy; and not only was he nominated as consul andcharged with the chief command in the Gallic war, while hewas still in Africa at the head of the army there, but he wasre-invested with the consulship for five years in succession104-100. (650-654). This proceeding, which looked like an inten­tional mockery of the exclusive spirit that the nobility hadexhibited in reference to this very man in all its folly andshortsightedness, was unparalleled in the annals of the re­public, and in fact absolutely incompatible with the spiritof the free constitution of Rome. In the Roman militarysystem in particular—the transformation of which from aburgess-militia into a set of mercenaries, begun in theAfrican war, was continued and completed by Mariusduring his five years of a supreme command unlimited fromthe exigencies of the times still more than from the termsof his appointment—the profound traces of this unconstitu­tional commandership-in-chief of the first democratic generalremained visible for all times.

the earth, with its fields of grain alternating -with forests ofwild fruit trees, it was beyond doubt even in Mithradates'time well cultivated and also comparatively populous. Butthere were hardly any towns properly so called; the countrypossessed nothing but strongholds, which served the peasantsas places of refuge and the king as treasuries for the custodyof the revenues which accrued to him; in the Lesser Ar­menia alone, in fact, there were counted seventy-five ofthese little royal forts.

136 THE RULE OF THE RESTORATION. [Book IV".


•
emancipated from the inconvenient associates who sharedits power; but these measures probably contributed stillfurther to disturb the never sincere agreement of the rulingaristocracy with the merchant-class and the proletariate.Both were very well aware, that the senate granted all itsconcessions only from fear and with reluctance; permanentlyattached to the rule of the senate by considerations neitherof gratitude nor of interest, both were very ready to rendersimilar services to any other master who offered them moreor even as much, and had no objection, if an opportunityoccurred, to cheat or to thwart the senate. Thus the resto­ration continued to govern with the desires and opinionsof a legitimate aristocracy, and with the constitution andmeans of government of a tyrannis. Its rule not onlyrested on the same bases as that of Gracchus, but it wasequally and in fact still more deficient in strength; it wasstrong where in league with the populace it overthrewvaluable institutions, but it was utterly powerless where ithad to face the bands of the streets or the interests of themerchants. It sat on the vacated throne with an evil con­science and divided hopes, indignant at the institutions ofthe state which it ruled and yet incapable of even system­atically assailing them, vacillating in all its conduct exceptwhere its own material advantage prompted its decision, apicture of faithlessness towards its own as well as the oppo­site party, of inward inconsistency, of the most pitiful im­potence, of the meanest selfishness—an unsurpassed ideal ofmisrule.. he men of It could not be otherwise; the whole nation was in athe restora- state of intellectual and moral decline, but especially the,'on' upper classes.

marine commands were especially sought after as being themost lucrative, it was usual to intrust a transmarine com­mand on the expiry of their official year to those magistrateswhom their office confined either in law or at any rate infact to the capital, that is, to the two praetors administeringjustice in the city and frequently also to the consuls; a coursewhich was compatible with the nature of prorogation, sincethe official authority of supreme magistrates acting in Eomeand in the provinces respectively, although differently en­tered on, was not in strict state-law different in kind.
Such was the state of things which Sulla found existing, Regulationand which formed the basis of his new arrangement. Its of theirmain principles were, a complete separation between the fonctionspolitical authority which governed in the, burgess dis- y u'tricts and the military authority which governed in thenon-burgess districts, and an uniform extension of the dura­tion of the supreme magistracy from one year to two, thefirst of which was devoted to civil, and the second tomilitary, functions. Locally the civil and the military Separationauthority had certainly been long separated by the con- of the po-stitution, and the former ended at the pomerium, where .^^Dthe latter began; but still the same man held the supreme thoritv.
Eolitical and the supreme military power united in hisand. In future the consul and praetor were to deal withthe senate and burgesses, the proconsul and propraetorwere to command the army; but all military power wascut off by law from the former, and all political action fromthe latter. This primarily led to the political separation Cisalpineof the region of Northern Italy from Italy proper. Hither- Gaulto they had stood perhaps in a national antagonism, inas- elict*° nlt"much as Northern Italy was inhabited chiefly by Liguriansand Celts, Central and Southern Italy by Italians; but, ina political and administrative point of view, the whole con­tinental territory of the Roman state from the Straits tothe Alps including the Illyrian possessions — burgess,Latin, and hon-Italian, communities without exception—was in the ordinary course of things under the administra­tion of the supreme magistrates who were acting in Rome,as in fact her colonial foundations extended through allthis territory.

On the other handthe tribune Marcus Plautius Silvanus, who entered on hisoffice on the 10th of December of the same year, carried alaw which took the commission of high treason out of thehands of the capitalist juryman, and intrusted it to otherswho were nominated by the free choice of the tribes withoutclass-qualification; the effect of which was, that that com­mission was converted from a scourge of the moderate partyinto a scourge of the ultras, and sent into exile among othersits own author, Quintus Varius, who was blamed by thepublic voice for the worst democratic outrages—the poison­ing of Quintus Metellus and the murder of Drusus.
Of greater importance than this singularly candid political Bestowal ofrecantation, was the change in the course of their policy the fran-toward the Italians. Exactly three hundred years had "hls.e on thepassed since Home had last been obliged to submit to the j^t^Jdictation of peace; Rome was now worsted once more, and faithful orthe peace which she desired could only be got by yielding to submitted,the terms of her antagonists. With the communities doubt­less, which had already risen in arms to subdue and todestroy Rome, the feud had become too bitter for the Romansto prevail on themselves to make the required concessions;and, had they done so, these terms would now perhaps havebeen rejected by the other side. But, if the original demandswere conceded under certain limitations to the communitiesthat had hitherto remained faithful, such a course would onthe one hand preserve the semblance of voluntary concession,while on the other hand it would prevent the otherwise in­evitable consolidation of the confederacy and thereby pavethe way for its subjugation. Accordingly the gates of Romancitizenship, which had so long remained closed againstentreaty, now suddenly opened when the sword knocked atthem; yet even now not fully and wholly, but in a mannerreluctant and annoying even for those admitted.

and sea, and to hasten the declaration of war. After afurther embassy of ten men had confirmed the statementthat Carthage was in reality arming (602), the senate 152.rejected the demand of Cato for an absolute declaration ofwar, but resolved in a secret sitting that war should bedeclared if the Carthaginians would not consent to dismisstheir army and to burn their materials for a fleet. Mean­while the conflict had already begun in Africa. Massinissahad sent back the men whom the Carthaginians had banished,under the escort of his son Gulussa, to the city. Whenthe Carthaginians closed their gates against them and killedalso some of the Numidians returning home, Massinissaput his troops in motion, and the patriot party in Carthagealso prepared for the struggle. But Hasdrubal, who wasplaced at the head of their army, was one of the usual inca-pables whom the Carthaginians were in the habit of employingas generals; strutting about in his general's purple like atheatrical king, and pampering his portly person even in thecamp, that vain-glorious and unwieldy man was little fittedto render help in an exigency which perhaps even thegenius of Hamilcar and the arm of Hannibal could have nolonger averted. Before the eyes of Scipio -32milianus, who,at that time a military tribune in the Spanish army, hadbeen sent to Massinissa to bring over African elephants forhis commander, and who on this occasion looked down onthe conflict from a mountain "like Zeus from Ida," theCarthaginians and Numidians fought a great battle, inwhich the former, though reinforced by 6000 Numidianhorsemen brought to them by discontented captains ofMassinissa, and superior in number to the enemy, wereworsted. After this defeat the Carthaginians offered tomake cessions of territory and payments of money to Massi­nissa, and Scipio at their solicitation attempted to bringabout an agreement; but the project of peace was frus­trated by the refusal of the Carthaginian patriots to sur­render the deserters. Hasdrubal however, closely hemmedin by the troops of his antagonist, was compelled to grantto the latter all that he demanded—the surrender of thedeserters, the return of the exiles, the delivery of arms, themarching off under the yoke, the payment of 100 talents(£24,400) annually for the next fifty years.

subordinate moneys levied from roads, bridges, and canals—mainly of customs-duties. The customs-duties of an­tiquity were, if not exclusively, at any rate principally port-dues, less frequently frontier-dues, on imports and exportsdestined for sale, and were levied by each community in itsports and its territory at pleasure. The Eomans recog­nized this principle generally, in so far as the originalsphere of the customs did not extend further than the rangeof the Roman franchise and the limit of the customs was byno means coincident with the limits of the empire, so that ageneral imperial tariff was unknown: it was only by meansof state treaties that a total exemption probably fromcustoms-dues in the client communities was secured for it­self by the Roman state, and in various cases also at leastfavourable terms in the interests of the Roman burgesses.But in those districts, which had not been admitted toalliance with Rome but were in the condition of subjectsproper and had not acquired immunity, the customs fell asa matter of course to the proper sovereign, that is, to theRoman community; and in consequence of this severallarge regions within the empire were constituted as separateRoman customs-districts, in which the several communities

Pun. 135 with refer­ence to Africa). In accordance with this regulation the magistrates of eachcommunity under the superintendence of the Koman governor (Cic. ad Q. Fr.i. 1, 8; SG. de Asclep. 22, 23) settled who were liable to the tax, and whatwas to be paid by each individual (imperata iiriKfpd\ia, Cic. ad Att. v. 16);if any one did not pay this in proper time, his tax-debt was sold just as inRome, i. e., it was handed over to a contractor with an adjudication to collectit (venditio tributorum, Cic. Ad Fam. iii. 8,5; ivoj omnium venditas, Cic. adAtt. v. 16). The produce of these taxes flowed into the cotfers of the leadingcommunities—the Jews, for instance, had to send their corn to Sidon—andfrom these coffers the fixed amount in money was then conveyed to Rome.These taxes also were consequently levied indirectly, and the intermediate agenteither retained, according to circumstances, a part of the produce of the taxesfor himself, or added to it from his own substance; the distinction betweenthis mode of levying and the other by means of the publicani lay merely inthe circumstance, that in the former the public authorities of the contributors, inthe latter Koman private speculators, constituted the intermediate agency.

endowments of their own nation. The literature of thesixth century had arisen from the influence of Greek art onhalf-cultivated, but excited and susceptible minds. The in­creased Hellenic culture of the seventh called forth a lite­rary reaction, which destroyed the germs of promise containedin those naive attempts at imitation by the winter-frost ofreflection, and rooted up the wheat and the tares of the olderSoipionic type of literature together. This reaction proceeded prima-circle. rily and chiefly from the circle which assembled around
Scipio iEmilianus, and whose most prominent membersamong the Roman noble world were, in addition to Scipiohimself, his elder friend and counsellor Gaius Laelius (con-140. sul in 614) and Scipio's younger companions, Lucius Furius136. Philus (consul in 618) and Spurius Mummius, the brotherof the destroyer of Corinth, among the Roman and Greekliterati the comedian Terence, the satirist Lucilius, thehistorian Polybius, and the philosopher Panaetius. Thosewho were familiar with the Iliad, with Xenophon, and withMenander, could not be greatly impressed by the RomanHomer, and still less by the bad translations of the tragediesof Euripides which Ennius had furnished and Pacuvius con­tinued to furnish. While patriotic consideration might setbounds to criticism in reference to their country's Annals,Lucilius at any rate directed very pointed shafts against"the dismal figures from the complicated expositions ofPacuvius;" and similar severe, but not unjust criticisms ofEnnius, Plautus, Pacuvius—all those poets " who appearedto have a licence to talk pompously and to reason iJlogically,"—are found in the polished author of the Rhetoric dedicatedto Herennius written at the close of this period. Peopleshrugged their shoulders at the interpolations, with whichthe homely popular wit of Rome had garnished the elegantcomedies of Philemon and Diphilus. Half smiling, halfenvious they turned away from the inadequate attempts of adull age, which that circle probably regarded somewhat aaa mature man regards the poetical effusions of his youth;despairing of the transplantation of the marvellous tree,they allowed the higher species of art in poetry and prosesubstantially to fall into abeyance, and restricted themselvesin these departments to an intelligent enjoyment of foreignmaster-pieces.

coming daily more apparent—-it was not only impossible to vVant of asecure his communications and supplies in presence of the fleet,ships of the enemy and the numerous pirates, but impos­sible to recover even the Piraeus, to say nothing of Asiaand the islands; and yet it was difficult to see how ships ofwar were to be got. As early as the winter of 667-8 Sulla 87-86.had despatched one of his ablest and most expert officers,Lucius Licinius Lucullus, into the eastern waters, to raiseships there if possible. Lucullus put to sea with six openboats, which he had borrowed from the Rhodians and othersmall communities; he himself merely by an accident es­caped from a piratic squadron, which captured most of hisboats; deceiving the enemy by changing his vessels hearrived by way of Crete and Cyrene at Alexandria; but theEgyptian court rejected his request for the support of shipsof war with equal courtesy and decision. Hardly anythingillustrates so clearly as does this fact the sad decay of theRoman state, which had once been able gratefully to declinethe offer of the kings of Egypt to assist the Romans withall their naval force, and now itself seemed to the Alexan­drian statesmen bankrupt. To all this fell to be added thefinancial embarrassment; Sulla had already been obliged toempty the treasuries of the Olympian Zeus, of the DelphicApollo, and of the Epidaurian Asklepios, for which the godswere compensated by the moiety, confiscated by way ofpenalty, of the Theban territory. But far worse than all thismilitary and financial perplexity was the reaction of thepolitical revolution in Rome; the rapid, sweeping, violentaccomplishment of which had far surpassed the worst appre­hensions. The revolution conducted the government in thecapital; Sulla had been deposed, his Asiatic command hadbeen intrusted to the democratic consul Marcus ValeriusFlaccus, who might be daily looked for in Greece. Thesoldiers had no doubt adhered to Sulla, who made everyeffort to keep them in good humour; but what could beexpected, when money and supplies were wanting, whenthe general was deposed and proscribed, when his successorwas on the way, and, in addition to all this, the war againstthe tough antagonist who commanded the sea was protractedwithout prospect of a close?

Marius necessarily produced among its promoters. While and the de-the decisive proposals were brought forward by his associates magognes.and carried after a struggle by his soldiers, Marius main­tained an attitude wholly passive, as if the political leaderwas not bound quite as much as the military, when the bruntof battle came, to present himself everywhere and foremostin person. Nor was this all; he was terrified at, and fledfrom the presence of, the spirits which he had himself evoked.When his associates resorted to expedients which an honour­able man could not approve, but without which in fact theobject of their efforts could not be attained, he attempted, inthe fashion usual with men whose politico-moral ideas are con­fused, to wash his hands of participation in those crimes andat the same time to profit by their results. There is a story,that the general once conducted secret negotiations in twodifferent apartments of his house, with Saturninus and hispartisans in the one, and with the deputies of the oligarchym the other, talking with the former of striking a blowagainst the senate, and with the latter of interfering againstthe revolt, and that under a pretext, which correspondedto the anxiety of the situation, he went to and fro betweenthe two conferences—a story as certainly invented, and ascertainly appropriate, as any incident in Aristophanes. Theambiguous attitude of Marius became notorious in the ques­tion of the oath. At first he seemed as though he wouldhimself refuse the oath required by the Appuleian laws onaccount of the informalities that had occurred at theirpassing, and then swore it with the reservation, "so far asthe laws were really valid;" a reservation which annulledthe oath itself, and which of course all the senators likewiseadopted in swearing, so that by this mode of taking the oaththe validity of the laws was not secured, but was on the con­trary for the first time fairly called in question.
The consequences of this behaviour—stupid beyond paral­lel—on the part of the celebrated general soon developedthemselves. Saturninus and Glaucia had not undertakenthe revolution and procured for Marius the supremacy of thestate, in order that they might be disowned and sacrificed byhim; if Glaucia, the favourite jester of the people, hadhitherto lavished on Marius the gayest flowers of his jovialeloquence, the garlands which he now wove for him were byno means redolent of roses and violets. A total rupturetook place, by which both parties were lost; for Marius had

that of directly maintaining a fleet in these waters, and forthis the Roman government lacked energy and perseverance.So all things just remained on the old footing; the piraticfleet was the only considerable naval power in the Mediter­ranean; the capture of men was the only trade thatflourished there. The Roman government was an onlooker;but the Roman merchants, as the best customers in theslave market, kept up an active and friendly traffic with thepirate captains, as the most important wholesale dealers inthat commodity, at Delos and elsewhere.
"We have followed the metamorphosis of the outward rela- General re-tions of Rome and the Romano-Hellenic world generally in suit,its leading outlines, from the battle of Pydna to the periodof the Gracchi, from the Tagus and the Bagradas to the Nileand the Euphrates. It was a great and difficult problemwhich Rome undertook, when she undertook to govern thisRomano-Hellenic world; it was not wholly misunderstood,but it was by no means solved. The untenableness of theidea of Cato's time—that the state should be limited toItaly, and that its rule beyond Italy should be only a pro­tectorate— was clearly discerned by the leading men ofthe following generation; and the necessity of substitutingfor this protectorate a direct sovereignty of Rome, that shouldpreserve the liberties of the communities, was probably re­cognized. But instead of carrying out this new arrangementfirmly, speedily, and uniformly, they annexed isolated pro­vinces just as convenience, caprice, collateral advantage, oraccident led them to do so; whereas the greater portion ofthe dependent states either remained in the intolerable un­certainty of their former position, or even, as was the casewith Syria especially, withdrew entirely from the influenceof Rome. And even the government itself degeneratedmore and more into a feeble and short-sighted selfishness.They were content with governing from one day to another,and barely transacting the current business as exigencyrequired. They were stern masters towards the weak.When the free city of Mylasa in Caria sent to PubliusCrassus, consul in 623, a beam for the construction of a 13).battering-ram different from what he had asked, the chiefmagistrate of the town was scourged for it; and Crassuswas not a bad man, and a strictly upright magistrate.

in the Alps of expeditions against the inhabitants of the Alps: in 636118- there was a triumph over the Stoeui, who were probably95. settled in the mountains above Verona; in 659 the consulLucius Grassus caused the Alpine valleys far and wide tobe ransacked and the inhabitants to be put to death, andyet he did not succeed in killing enough of them toenable him to celebrate a village triumph and to couplethe laurels of the victor with his oratorical fame. But asthe Romans remained satisfied with razzias of this sortwhich merely exasperated the natives without renderingthem harmless, and, apparently, withdrew the troops againafter every such inroad, the state of matters in the regionbeyond the Po remained substantially the same as before.

Forces like those of Mithradates had not beenseen in Asia since the Persian wars. The statements that,leaving out of account the Armenian auxiliary army, he tookthe field with 250,000 infantry and 40,000 cavalry, and that300 Pontic decked and 100 open vessels put to sea, seem nottoo exaggerated in the case of a warlike sovereign who had athis disposal the numberless inhabitants of the steppes. Hisgenerals, particularly the brothers Neoptolemus and Arche-laus, were experienced and cautious Greek captains;among the soldiers of the king there was no want of bravemen who despised death ; and the armour glittering with goldand silver and the rich dresses of the Scythians and Medesmingled gaily with the bronze and steel of the Greektroopers. No unity of military organization, it is true, boundtogether these party-coloured masses; the army of Mithra­dates was just one of those unwieldy Asiatic war-machines,which had so often already—on the last occasion exactly acentury before at Magnesia—succumbed to a superior mili­tary organization; but still the East was in arms against theRomans, while in the western half of the empire also mattersWeak comi- looked far from peaceful.

the meanest passions often combine to produce it in the samebreast. The soldiers of Sulla voluntarily according to theRoman custom swore mutual oaths that they would standfirmly by each other, and each voluntarily brought to thegeneral his savings as a contribution to the costs of the war.But considerable as was the weight of this solid and selectbody of troops in comparison with the masses of the enemy,Sulla saw very well that Italy could not be subdued withfive legions if it remained united in resolute resistance.To settle accounts with the popular party and their inca­pable autocrats would not have been difficult; but he sawopposed to him and united with that party the whole massof those who desired no oligarchic restoration with itsterrors, and above all the whole body of new burgesses—boththose who had been prevented by the Julian law from takingpart in the insurrection, and those whose revolt a few yearsHis mode- before had brought Rome to the brink of ruin. Sulla fullyration. surveyed the situation of affairs, and was far removed fromthe blind exasperation and the obstinate rigour which charac­terized the majority of his party. While the edifice of thestate was in flames, while his friends were being murdered,his houses destroyed, his family driven into exile, he hadremained undisturbed at his post till the public foe wasconquered and the Roman frontier was secured. He nowtreated Italian affairs in the same spirit of patriotic andjudicious moderation, and did whatever he could to pacify themoderate party and the new burgesses, and to prevent thecivil war from assuming the far more dangerous form of afresh war between the old Romans and the Italian allies.The first letter which Sulla addressed to the senate had askednothing but what was right and just, and had expresslydisclaimed a reign of terror. In harmony with its terms,he now presented the prospect of unconditional pardon to allthose who should even now break off from the revolutionarygovernment, and caused his soldiers man by man to swearthat they would meet the Italians thoroughly as friends andfellow-citizens. The most binding declarations secured tothe new burgesses the political rights which they had ac­quired; so that Carbo, for that reason, wished hostages tobe furnished to him by every civic community in Italy, butthe proposal broke down under general indignation andunder the opposition of the senate.

merely to this much, that, as a general, he gained some cheapvillage triumphs in the Alps and, as a statesman, won by hislaws about voting and luxury some victories nearly as seriousover the revolutionary spirit of the times. His real talentconsisted in his being quite as accessible and bribable as anyother upright senator, with only this difference that he dis­cerned with some cunning the moment when the matter beganto be hazardous; and above all in his acting the part of Fa-bricius before the public by virtue of his noble and dignifiedappearance. In a military point of view, no doubt, we findsome honourable exceptions of able officers belonging to thehighest circles of the aristocracy; but the rule was, that thenoble lords, when they were to assume the command ofarmies, hastily read up from the Greek military manualsand the Roman annals as much as was required for holdinga military conversation, and then, when in the field, actedmost wisely by intrusting the real command to an officer ofhumble lineage and tried discretion. In fact, if a couple ofcenturies before the senate resembled an assembly of kings,these their successors played not ill the part of princes. Butthe incapacity of these restored nobles was fully equalledby their political and moral worthlessness. If the state ofreligion, to which we shall revert, did not present a faith­ful reflection of the wild dissoluteness of this epoch, and ifthe external history of the period did not exhibit the utterbaseness of the Roman nobles as one of its most essentialelements, the horrible crimes, which came to light in rapidsuccession among the highest circles of Rome, would alonesuffice to indicate their character.Administra- The administration, internal and external, was what wastion under ^o De expected under such a government.

The result was asit had been two years before. The Roman officer accom­plished the commission intrusted to him with the aid of thesmall Roman corps which the governor of the province ofAsia had at his disposal, and the levy of the free Phrygiansand Galatians; king Nicomedes and king Ariobarzanesagain ascended their tottering thrones; Mithradates, althoughunder various pretexts evading the summons to furnish con­tingents, gave to the Romans no open resistance; on thecontrary the Bithynian pretender Socrates was even put todeath by his orders (664). 90.

Nevertheless he pursued with equaltenacity and activity his plan of extending bis territory inAsia Minor. This strange combination of a policy of peaceat any price with a policy of conquest was certainly in itselfuntenable, and was simply a fresh proof that Mithradates didnot belong to the class of genuine statesmen; he knew neitherhow to prepare for conflict like king Philip nor how to sub­mit like king Attalus, but in the true style of a sultan wasperpetually fluctuating between a greedy desire of conquestand the sense of his own weakness. But even in this pointof view his proceedings can only be understood, when werecollect that Mithradates had become acquainted by twenty-years' experience with the Roman policy of that day.

91. the orator Lucius Crassus ( + 663) on the Palatine (P. 416).But where they could plunder or purchase, instead of creatingfor themselves, they did so; it was a wretched indication ofthe poverty of Roman architecture, that it already began toemploy the columns of the old Greek temples; the RomanCapitol, for instance, was embellished by Sulla with those ofthe temple of Zeus at Athens. The works, that were pro­duced in Rome, proceeded from the hands of foreigners; thefew Roman artists of this period, who are particularly men­tioned, are without exception Italian or transmarine Greekswho had migrated thither. Such was the case with thearchitect Hermodorus from the Cyprian Salamis, who amongother works restored the Roman docks and built for Quintus
143. Metellus (consul in 611) the temple of Jupiter Stator inthe basilica constructed by him, and for Decimus Brutus
138. (consul in 616) the temple of Mars in the Flaminian circus;

Finally, music and dancing passed over in like mannerfrom Hellas to Rome, solely in order to be there applied tothe enhancement of decorative luxury. Such foreign artswere certainly not new in Rome; the state had from oldentime allowed Etruscan flute-players and dancers to appearat its festivals, and the freedmen and the lowest class of theRoman people had previously followed this trade.

procedure on the other were materially restricted, inasmuchas processes of high treason for instance were withdrawnfrom the former, and the more serious falsifications and in­juries from the latter; but apart from this there was nochange in either institution. Secondly, as respects the pre­sidency of the courts, six praetors, as we have already men­tioned, were now available for the superintendence of thedifferent jury-courts, besides whom special directors werenamed for particular tribunals. Thirdly, the senators wereonce more installed in the office of jurymen in room of theGracchan equites: in the spear-court alone, so far as weknow, the previous arrangement continued to subsist.
The political aim of these enactments—to put- an end tothe share which the equites had hitherto had in the govern­ment—is clear as day; but it as little admits of doubt, thatthese were not mere measures of a political tendency, butthat they formed the first attempt to amend the Romancriminal procedure and criminal law, which had since thestruggle between the orders fallen more and more into con­fusion. From this Sullan legislation dates the distinction—substantially unknown to the earlier law—between civil andcriminal causes, in the sense which we now attach to theseexpressions; henceforth a criminal cause appears as thatwhich comes before a bench of jurymen, a civil cause as thatwhich comes before the individual judex. The whole body ofthe Sullan ordinances as to the Qiuestiones may be characterizedat once as the first Roman code after the Twelve Tables, andas the first criminal code specially issued at all. But in thedetails also there appears a laudable and liberal spirit.Singular as it may sound regarding the author of the proscrip­tions, it remains nevertheless true, that he abolished thepunishment of death for political offences; for, as accordingto the Roman custom which Sulla retained unchanged thepeople only, and not the jury-commission could sentence toforfeiture of life or to imprisonment (P. 112), the trans­ference of processes of high treason from the burgesses to astanding commission amounted to the abolition of capitalpunishment for such offences. On the other hand, the restric­tion of the pernicious special commissions for particular casesof high treason, of which the Varian commission (P. 236) inthe Social war had been a specimen, likewise involved an im­provement. The whole reform was of singular and lastingbenefit, and a permanent monument of the practical, mode-

was very soon apparent, that the celebrated general was inpolitics a mere incapable; that his ambition was that of thefarmer who would cope with and, if possible, surpass thearistocrats in titles, and not that of the statesman whodesires to govern because he feels within him the power todo so; that every enterprise, which was based on his personalstanding as a politician, must necessarily even under themost favourable circumstances be ruined by himself.
He knew neither the art of gaining his antagonists, northat of keeping his own party in subjection. The oppositionagainst him and his comrades was even of itself sufficientlyconsiderable; for not only did the government party belongto it in a body, but also a great part of the burgesses, whoguarded with jealous eyes their exclusive privileges againstthe Italians; and by the course which things took the wholeclass of the wealthy was also driven over to the government.Saturninns and Glaucia were from the fifst masters andservants of the proletariate and therefore not at all on agood footing with the moneyed aristocracy, which had noobjection now and then to check the senate by means of therabble, but had no liking for street-riots and violent out­rages. As early as Saturninus' first tribunate, his armedbands had their skirmishes with the equites; the vehementopposition which his election as tribune for 654 encounteredshows clearly how small was the party favourable to him.It should have been Marius' endeavour to avail himself ofthe dangerous help of such associates only in moderation,and to convince all and sundry that they were destinednot to rule, but to serve him as their ruler. As he didprecisely the contrary, and the matter came to look quite asif the object was to place the government in the handsnot of an intelligent and vigorous master, but of the merecanaille, the men of material interests, terrified to death at theprospect of such confusion, again attached themselves closelyto the senate in presence of this common danger. WhileGaius Gracchus, clearly perceiving that no governmentcould be overthrown by means of the proletariate alone, hadespecially sought to gain over to his side the propertiedclasses, those continuators of his work began by producinga reconciliation between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.

insurrection thenceforth spread at any rate no further. InEtruria and Etruria and Umbria especially, where it was just beginning,Umbria it was subdued with singular rapidity, still more, probably,tranquil- ^ means of the Julian law than through the success of theRoman arms. In the former Latin colonies, and in thethickly-peopled region of the Po, there were opened up copiousand now reliable sources of aid: with these, and with theresources of the burgesses themselves, they could proceed tosubdue the now isolated conflagration. The two formercommanders-in-chief returned to Rome, Caesar as censor elect,Marius, because his conduct of the war was blamed as vacil­lating and slow, and the man of sixty-six was declared to bein his dotage. This objection was very probably groundless;Marius showed at least his bodily vigour by appearing dailyin the circus at Rome, and even as commander-in-chiefhe seems to have displayed on the whole his old ability inthe last campaign; but he had not achieved the brilliantsuccesses by which alone he could after his political bank­ruptcy rehabilitate himself in public opinion, and so thecelebrated champion was to his bitter vexation now, even asan officer, unceremoniously laid aside as useless. The place ofMarius in the Marsian army was taken by the consul of thisyear, Lucius Porcius Cato, who had fought with distinctionin Etruria, and that of Caesar in the Campanian army byhis lieutenant, Lucius Sulla, to whom were due some of themost material successes of the previous campaign; G use usStrabo retained—now as consul—the command which he hadheld so successfully in the Picenian territory.
Thus began the second campaign in 665. The insurgentsopened it, even before winter was over, by the bold attempt—recalling the grand passages of the Samnite wars—to senda Marsian army of 15,000 men to Etruria with a view to aidthe insurrection brewing in Northern Italy. But Strabo,through whose district it had to pass, intercepted and totallydefeated it; only a few got back to their far distant home."When at length the season allowed the Roman armies toassume the offensive, Cato entered the Marsian territoryand advanced, successfully encountering the enemy there; buthe fell in the region of the Fucine lake at an attack on theenemy's camp, so that the exclusive superintendence of theoperations in Central Italy devolved on Strabo.

Among the probablynumerous poets who imitated Greek tragedies two alonePacuvius. acquired distinction. Marcus Pacuvius from Brundisium219-129. (535—c. 625) who in his earlier years earned his livelihoodin Rome by painting aud only composed tragedies whenadvanced in life, belongs as respects both his years and hisstyle to the sixth rather than the seventh century, althoughhis poetical activity falls within the latter. He composed onthe whole after the manner of his countryman, uncle, andmaster Ennius. Polishing more carefully and aspiring toa higher strain than his predecessor, he was regarded byfavourable critics of art afterwards as a model of artisticpoetry and of rich style: in the fragments, however, thatnave reached us proofs are not wanting to justify Cicero'scensure of the poet's language and Lucilius' censure of histaste; his language appears more rugged than that of hispredecessor, his style of composition pompous and punc­tilious.* There are traces that he like Ennius attachedmore value to philosophy than to religion; but he did notat any rate, like the latter, prefer dramas chiming in withneological views and preaching sensual passion or modernenlightenment, and drew without distinction from Sophoclesor from Euripides; of that poetry with a decided special aim,which almost stamps Ennius with genius, there can havebeen no vein in the younger poet.

Sulla struck as regent, were scarcely more than pieces coinedfor the convenience of his triumphal presents. Silver stillas before circulated exclusively as actual money; gold,whether it, as was usual, circulated in bars or bore thestamp of a foreign or possibly even of an inland mint, wastaken solely by weight. Nevertheless gold and silver wereon a par as means of exchange, and the fraudulent alloyingof gold was treated in law, like the issuing of spurious silvermoney, as a monetary oifence. They thus obtained theimmense advantage of precluding, in the case of the mostimportant medium of exchange, even the possibility of mone­tary fraud and adulteration. Otherwise the coinage was ascopious as it was of exemplary purity. After the silver piecehad been reduced in the Hannibalic war from r^ (i. 465)to s\ of a pound (ii. 173) it retained for more than threecenturies the same weight and the same quality; no alloy­ing took place. The copper money, which apparently aboutthe beginning of this period had become wholly small changeand had ceased to be employed as formerly in large trans­actions, was confined to the smaller values of an as (id.) andunder, which could not well be represented in silver. Thesorts of coins were arranged according to a simple principle,and in the then smallest coin of the ordinary issue—thequadrans (^-farthing)—carried down to the limit of tangiblevalue. It was a monetary system, which, for the judiciousprinciples on which it was based and for the iron rigour withwhich they were applied, stands alone in antiquity and hasbeen but rarely paralleled even in modern times. Yet it toohad its weak point. According to a custom, common in allantiquity, but which reached its highest development at Car­thage (ii. 20), the Roman government issued along with the Token-good silver denarii also denarii of copper plated with silver, money.which had to be accepted like the former and were just atoken-money analogous to our paper currency, with com­pulsory circulation and recourse on the public chest, inasmuchas it also was not entitled to reject the plated pieces. Thiswas no more an official adulteration of the coinage than ourmanufacture of paper money, for they practised the thingquite openly; Marcus Drusus proposed in 663, with the 91.view of gaining the means for his largesses of grain, thesending forth of one plated denarius for every seven silverones issuing fresh from the mint; nevertheless this measurenot only offered a dangerous handle to private forgery, but

If its whole population at thattime was equal to that of the present day, we should have toassume accordingly a mass of slaves amounting to thirteenor fourteen millions. It needs however no such fallaciouscalculations to render the dangerous character of thisstate of things apparent; this is loudly enough attested bythe partial servile insurrections, and by the appeal whichfrom the beginning of the revolution was at the close of everyouthreak addressed to the slaves to take up arms against theirmasters and to fight out their liberty.

Inthis way the great evils were avoided, that are otherwise in­evitably associated with the setting up of two precious150. metals; the severe gold crises—as about 600, for instance,when in consequence of the discovery of the Tauriscan gold-seams (P. 174) gold as compared with silver fell at once inItaly about 33^$—exercised at least no direct influence onthe silver money and retail transactions. The nature of thecase implied that, the more transmarine traffic extended,gold the more decidedly rose from the second place to thefirst; and that it did so, is confirmed by the statements asto the balances in the treasury and as to its transactions;but the government was not thereby induced to introducegold into the coinage.

Of greater importance than this regulation of African Political reclientship were the political consequences of the Jugurthine slllts-war or rather of the Jugurthine insurrection, althoughthese have been frequently estimated too highly. Certainlyall the evils of the government were therein brought tolight in all their nakedness; it was not merely notorious but,so to speak, judicially established, that among the govern­ing lords of Some everything was treated as venal—the treatyof peace and the right of intercession, the rampart of thecamp and the life of the soldier; the African had said nomore than the simple truth, when on his departure fromRome he declared that, if he had only gold enough, he wouldundertake to buy the city itself. But the whole externaland internal government of this period bore the same stampof miserable baseness. In our case the accidental fact, thatthe war in Africa is brought nearer to us by means of betteraccounts than the other contemporary military and politicalevents, shifts the true perspective; contemporaries learnedby these revelations nothing but what everybody knew longbefore and every intrepid patriot had long been in a posi­tion to support by facts. The circumstance, however, thatthey were now furnished with some fresh, still stronger andstill more irrefutable, proofs of the baseness of the restoredsenatorial government—a baseness only surpassed by itsincapacity—might have been of importance, had there beenan opposition and a public opinion with which the govern­ment would have found it necessary to come to terms.

Nothingopposed the advance into Macedonia and Thrace, Philippiwas occupied, Abdera was voluntarily evacuated by thePontic garrison, the European continent in general wascleared of the enemy.

The capitalist party offered the moat vehement resistance,and, in consequence of the irresolution of the greater partof the aristocracy and the vacillation of the comitia, wouldbeyond question have carried the rejection of the law as tojurymen, if it had been put to the vote by itself. Drususaccordingly comprised all his proposals in one law: and, asthus all the burgesses interested in the distributions ofgrain and land were compelled to vote also for the law as tojurymen, he succeeded in carrying the law by their helpand that of the Italians, who stood firmly by Drusus withthe exception of the large landowners, particularly thosein Umbria and Etruria, whose domanial possessions werethreatened. It was not carried, however, until Drusus hadcaused the consul Philippus, who would not desist from oppo­sition, to be arrested and carried off to prison by a bailiff.The people celebrated the tribune as their benefactor, andreceived him in the theatre by rising up and applauding;but the voting had not so much decided the struggle as trans­ferred it to another ground, for the opposite party justlycharacterized the proposal of Drusus as contrary to the law
98. of 656 (P. 218) and therefore as null. The chief opponentof the tribune, the consul Philippus, summoned the senateon this ground to cancel the Livian law as informal; butthe majority of the senate, glad to be rid of the equestriancourts, rejected the proposal. The consul thereupon declaredin the open market that it was not possible to govern withsuch a senate, and that he would look out for another state-council: ho seemed to meditate a coup d'etat. The senate,convoked accordingly by Drusus, after stormy discussionspronounced a vote of censure and want of confidence againstthe consul; but in secret a great part of the majority beganto cherish apprehension respecting the revolution with whichthey seemed to be threatened on the part both of Philippusand of a large portion of the capitalists. Other circum­stances added to that apprehension. One of theTnost activeand eminent of those who shared the views of Drusus, theorator Lucius Crassus, died suddenly a few days after that

The connections formedby Drusus with the Italians, which he bad at first com­municated only to a few of his most intimate friends, be­came gradually divulged, and the furious cry of high treasonwhich his antagonists raised was echoed by many, perhapsby most, men of the government party.

While this step enabled thepopular chief to acquire a permanent position and onewhich protected its holder, the next object was to secure forhim material power or, in other words, to attach the multi­tude of the capital—for that no reliance was to be placed onthe country people coming only from time to time to thecity, had been sufficiently apparent—with its interests stead­fastly to its leader. This purpose was served, first of all, Pistribu-by introducing distributions of corn in the capital. The tion ofgrain accruing to the state from the provincial tenths had £raln-already been frequently given away at nominal prices to theburgesses (ii. 372). Gracchus enacted, that every burgesswho should personally present himself in the capital shouldthenceforth be allowed monthly a definite quantity—appa­rently 5 modii (lj bushel)—from the public stores, themodius being given at 6J- asses (3d) or not quite the half ofa low average price (ii. 373); for which purpose the publiccorn-stores were enlarged by the construction of the newSempronian granaries. This distribution—which conse­quently excluded the burgesses living out of the capital, andcould not but attract to Rome the whole mass of the burgess-proletariate—was designed to bring the burgess-proletariateof the capital, which hitherto had mainly depended on thearistocracy, into dependence on the leaders of the movement-party, and thus to supply the new master of the state at oncewith a body-guard and with a firm majority in the comitia.

To the north of, and beyond,the city proper, the pretty considerable space of the modernEl Mersa, even at that time occupied in great part by villasand well-watered gardens, and then called Magalia, hada circumvallation of its own dovetailed into the city wall.On the opposite point of the peninsula, the Jebel-Khawinear the modern village of Ghamart, lay the necropolis.These three—the old city, the suburb, and the necropolis—together filled the whole breadth of the promontory on itsside next the gulf, and were only accessible by the two high­ways leading to Utica and Tunes along that narrow tongueof land, which, although not closed by a wall, yet afforded amost advantageous position for the armies taking their standunder the protection of the capital with the view of protect­ing it in return.
The difficult task of reducing so well fortified a city wasrendered still more difficult by the fact, that the resources ofthe capital itself and of its territory which still included800 townships and was mostly under the power of the emi­grant party on the one hand, and the numerous tribes of thefree or half-free Libyans hostile to Massinissa on the other,enabled the Carthaginians simultaneously with their defenceof the city to keep a numerous army in the field—an armywhich, from the desperate temper of the emigrants and theserviceableness of the light Numidian cavalry, the besiegerscould not afford to disregard.The siege.

These addresses of thenew Pericles and the promise of Mithradates to redeliver tothe Athenians the island of Delos which they had formerlypossessed were so far effectual that, while the few personspossessed of judgment escaped from Athens, the mob andone or two literati whose heads were turned formally re­nounced the Roman rule. So the ex-philosopher became adespot who, supported by his bands of Pontic mercenaries,commenced an infamous and bloody rule; and the Piraeuswas converted into a Pontic harbour. As soon as the troopsof Mithradates gained a footing on the Greek continent,most of the small free states—the Achaeans, Laconians, Boeo­tians—as far as Thessaly joined them. Sura, after havingdrawn some reinforcements from Macedonia, advanced intoBoeotia to bring help to the besieged Thespiae, and engagedin conflicts with Archelaus and Aristion during three days atChaeronea; but they led to no decision and Sura was obligedto retire when the Pontic reinforcements from the Pelopon­nesus approached (end of 666, beg. of 667). 88. 87.
So commanding was the position of Mithradates, particu­larly by sea, that an embassy of Italian insurgents invited himto make an attempt to land in Italy; but their cause was al­ready by that time lost, and the king rejected the suggestion.

Jugurthareadily entered into them; he had at once bound himself topay 200,000 pounds of silver, and had even delivered up hiselephants and 300 hostages, as well as 3000 Roman deserterswho were immediately put to death. At the same time, how­ever, the king's most confidential counsellor, Bomilcar—whonot unreasonably apprehended that, if peace should ensue,Jugurtha would deliver him up as the murderer of Massivato the Roman courts—was gained by Metellus and induced,in consideration of an assurance of impunity as respectedthat murder and of great rewards, to promise that he woulddeliver the king alive or dead into the hands of the Romans.But neither that official negotiation nor this intrigue led tothe desired result. When Metellus brought forward thesuggestion that the king should give himself up in person asa prisoner, the latter broke off the negotiations; Bomilcar's
t intercourse with the enemy was discovered, and he was
arrested and executed. These diplomatic cabals of themeanest kind admit of no apology; but the Romans hadevery reason to aim at the possession of the person of theirantagonist. The war had reached a point, at which it couldneither be carried further nor abandoned. The state of feel­ing in Numidia was evinced by the revolt of Vaga,* the mostconsiderable of the cities occupied by the Romans, in the
108—107. winter of 646-7; on which occasion the whole Roman gar­rison, officers and men, were put to death with the exceptionof the commandant Titus Turpilius Silanus, who was after­wards—whether rightly or wrongly, we cannot'tell—con­demned to death by a Roman court-martial and executed forhaving an understanding with the enemy. The town wassurprised by Metellus on the second day after its revolt, andgiven over to all the rigour of martial law; but if such wasthe temper of the easily reached and comparatively sub­missive dwellers on the banks of the Bagradas, what mightbe expected further inland and among the roving tribes ofthe desert?

warning which he communicated to the consul Philippus, tobeware of the murderous emissaries of the Italians at thefederal festival on the Alban Mount, served only further tocompromise him, for it showed how deeply he was involvedin the conspiracies springing up among the Italians.
Philippus insisted with daily increasing vehemence on the The Liviauabrogation of the Livian laws; the majority grew daily more 1"B'S an"lukewarm in their defence. A return to the former state of nulled-things soon appeared to the great multitude of the timidand the irresolute in the senate the only way of escape, anda decree cancelling these laws on account of informality wasissued. Drusus, after his fashion sternly acquiescing, con­tented himself with the remark that it was the senate itselfwhich thus restored the hated equestrian courts, and waivedhis right to render the decree of cassation invalid by meansof his veto. The attack of the senate on the capitalist' partywas totally repulsed, and willingly or unwillingly they sub­mitted once more to the former yoke.
But the great capitalists were not content with having Murder ofconquered. One evening, when Drusus was just about at Drusus.his entrance hall to take his leave of the multitude which asusual escorted him, he suddenly dropped down in front of theimage of his father; an assassin's hand had struck him, andso surely that a few hours afterwards he expired. The per­petrator had vanished in the evening twilight without anyone recognizing him, and no judicial investigation took place;but none such was needed to bring to light in this ease thedagger, with which the aristocracy pierced its own flesh.The same violent and terrible end, which had swept away thedemocratic reformers, was destined also for the Gracchus ofthe aristocracy. It involved a profound and melancholylesson. Reform was frustrated by the resistance or by theweakness of the aristocracy, even when the attempt at re­formation proceeded from their own ranks. Drusus hadstaked his strength and his life in the attempt to overthrowthe dominion of the merchants, to organize emigration, toavert the impending civil war; he himself saw the mer­chants ruling more absolutely than ever, found all his ideasof reform frustrated, and died with, the consciousness thathis sudden death would be the signal for the most fearfulcivil war that ever desolated the fair land of Italy.

The revolution, at an end in so far asthe old constitution was recognized by both sides as finallyset aside and the aim and method of the new political de­velopment were clearly settled, had yet up to this time dis­covered nothing but provisional solutions for this problemof the reorganization of the state; neither the Gracchannor the Sullan constitution of the community bore the stampof finality.

It was no accidental catastrophe which patriotismand genius might have warded off; it was old social evils—at the bottom of all, the ruin of the middle class by theslave proletariate—that brought destruction on the .Romancommonwealth. The most sagacious statesman was in theplight of the physician, to whom it is equally painful toprolong or to abridge the agony of his patient. Beyonddoubt it was the better for the interests of Rome, the morequickly and thoroughly a despot set aside all remnants ofthe ancient free constitution, and invented new forms andexpressions for the moderate measure of human prosperityfor which absolutism leaves room: the intrinsic advantage,which belonged to monarchy under the given circumstancesas compared with any oligarchy, lay mainly in the verycircumstance that such a despotism, energetic in pullingdown and energetic in building up, could never be exer­cised by a collegiate board. But such calm considerationsdo not mould history; it is not reason, it is passion alone,that builds for the future. The Romans had just to waitin order to see how long their commonwealth would continueunable to live and unable to die, and whether it would ul­timately find its master and, so far as might be possible, itsregenerator in a man of mighty gifts, or would collapse inmisery and weakness.Finances of It remains that we should notice the economic and socialthe state, relations of the period before us, so far as we have not

But the careful regu­lation of the boundary between the Roman province andthe Numidian kingdom, which enclosed it on three sides,showed that Home would by no means tolerate in referenceto herself what she had permitted in reference to Carthage;while the name of the new province, Africa, on the otherhand appeared to indicate that Rome did not at all regardthe boundary now marked off as a definitive one. Thesupreme administration of the new province was intrustedto a Roman governor, whose seat was Utica. Its frontierdid not need any regular defence, as the allied Numidiankingdom everywhere separated it from the inhabitants ofthe desert. In the matter of taxes Rome dealt on the wholewith moderation. Those communities which from the be­ginning of the war had taken part with Rome—viz., onlythe maritime towns of Utica, Hadrumetum, Little Leptis,Thapsus, Achulla, and Usalis, and the inland town ofTheudalis—retained their territory and became free cities;which was also the case with the newly founded communityof deserters. The territory of the city of Carthage withthe exception of a tract presented to Utica, and that ofthe other destroyed townships, became Roman domainland,which was let on lease. The remaining townships likewiseforfeited in law their property in the soil and their muni­cipal liberties ; but their land and their constitution were leftto them on sufferance for the time being and until furtherorders from the Roman government, and the communities

the whole senatorial and non-senatorial noble society ofRome. But not long before the time of Gaius Gracchusthe law had declared a seat in the senate incompatible withservice in the cavalry (P. 73), and the senators were thusmarked off from those capable of serving as equites; andaccordingly the equestrian order, taken as a whole, might beregarded as representing the aristocracy of speculators incontradistinction to the senate. Nevertheless, those membersof senatorial families who had not entered the senate, moreespecially the younger members, did not cease to serve asequites and consequently to bear the name; and, in fact, theburgess-cavalry properly so called—that is, the eighteenequestrian centuries—in consequence of being made up bythe censors continued to be chiefly filled from the youngsenatorial aristocracy (ii. 319).
This order of the equites—that is to say substantially thewealthy merchants—in various ways came roughly intocontact with the governing senate. There was a naturalantipathy between the noble aristocrats and the men towhom money had given rank. The ruling lords, especiallythe better class of them, stood just as much aloof fromspeculations, as the men of material interests were in­different to political questions and coterie-feuds. The twoclasses had already frequently come into sharp collision,particularly in the provinces ; for, though in general the pro­vincials had far more reason than the Roman capitalists hadto complain of the partiality of the Roman magistrates, yetthe ruling lords of the senate did not condescend to counte­nance the greedinesses and injustices of the moneyed menac the expense of the subjects so thoroughly and absolutelyas was desired. In spite of their agreement in opposing acommon foe such as was Tiberius Gracchus, there yawneda deep gulf between the noble and the moneyed aristocracy;and Gaius, more adroit than his brother, enlarged it tillthe alliance was broken up and the mercantile class rangedInsignia of itself on his side. That the external privileges, throughthe equites. which afterwards the men of equestrian census were distin­guished from the rest of the multitude—the golden finger-ring instead of the ordinary ring of iron or copper, and theseparate and better place at the burgess-festivals—were firstconferred on the equites by Gaius Gracchus, is not certain,but is not improbable.

That which hadbeen deemed almost impossible—that a conservative shouldtake up the reforming ideas of the Gracchi, and should be­come the champion of equal rights forthe Italians—had never­theless occurred; a man of the high aristocracy had resolvedto emancipate the Italians from the Sicilian Straits to theAlps and the government at one and the same time, and toapply all his earnest zeal, all his thorough devotedness tothese generous plans of reform. "Whether he actually, aswas reported, placed himself at the head of a secret league,whose threads ramified through Italy and whose membersbound themselves by an oath* to stand by each other forDrusus and for the common cause, cannot be ascertained;but, even if he did not lend himself to acts so dangerous andin fact unwarrantable for a Roman magistrate, yet it is cer­tain that he did not keep to mere general promises, and thatdangerous connections were formed in his name, althoughperhaps without his consent or against his will. "With joythe Italians heard that Drusus had carried his first proposalswith the consent of the great majority of the senate; withstill greater joy all the communities of Italy celebrated notlong afterwards the recovery of the tribune, who had beensuddenly attacked by severe illness. But as Drusus's fur-

Hewas not afraid to demean himself in a way which wouldhave given to any energetic government not fettered by sel­fish considerations manifold ground and occasion for de­claring war; but he carefully avoided any open rupturewhich would have placed the senate under the necessity ofdeclaring it. As soon as men appeared to be in earnest hedrew back, before Sulla as well as before Aquillius; hehoped, doubtless, that he would not always be confronted byenergetic generals, that he too would, as well as Jugurtha,fall in with his Scaurus or Albinus.

But it was not the intention of Aquillius to allow

The latter, who was under the power of theBoman general and was, moreover, his debtor for the accumu­lated war expenses and for sums promised to the general inperson, could not avoid complying with the suggestion thathe should begin war with Mithradates. The declaration ofwar by Bithynia took place; but, even when the vessels of Nico­medes closed the Bosporus against those of Pontus, and histroops marched into the frontier districts of Pontus and laidwaste the region of Amastris, Mithradates remained still un­shaken in his policy of peace; instead of driving the Bithyniansover the frontier, he lodged a complaint with the Roman en­voys and asked them either to mediate or to allow him theprivilege of self-defence. But he was informed by Aquillius.that he must under all circumstances refrain from waragainst Nicomedes. That indeed was plain.

government when measures against the democrats were inquestion, it sternly resented every attempt to restrict it inthis its well-acquired right of unlimited sway in the pro­vinces. Several such attempts were now made; the governingaristocracy began again to feel its strength, and its very bestmen reckoned themselves bound, at least for their own part,to oppose the dreadful maladministration in the provinces.The most resolute in this respect was Quintus MuciusScawola, like his father Publius pontifex maximus and in659 consul, the foremost jurist and one of the most excellent 95.men of his time. As praetorian governor (about 656) of 98.Asia, the richest and worst abused of all the provinces, he—in concert with his older friend, distinguished as an officer,jurist, and historian, the consular Publius Rutilius Rufus—set a severe and deterring example. Without making anydistinction between Italians and provincials, noble andignoble, he took up every complaint, and not only compelledthe Roman merchants and state-lessees to give full pecuniarycompensation for proven injuries, but, when some of theirmost important and most unscrupulous agents were foundguilty of crimes deserving death, deaf to all offers of briberyhe ordered them to be duly crucified. The senate approvedhis conduct, and even made it an instruction afterwards tothe governors of Asia that they should take as their modelthe principles of Scaevola's administration; but the equites,although they did not venture to meddle with that highlyaristocratic and influential statesman himself, brought totrial his associates and ultimately (about 662) even the most 92,considerable of them, his legate Publius Rufus, who was de­fended only by his merits and recognized integrity, not byfamily connection. The charge, that such a man had allowedhimself to perpetrate exactions in Asia, almost broke downtinder its own absurdity and under the infamy of theaccuser, one Apicius; yet the welcome opportunity ofhumbling the consular was not allowed to pass, and, whenthe latter, disdaining false rhetoric, mourning robes, andtears, defended himself briefly, simply, and to the point,and proudly refused the homage which the sovereign capi­talists desired, he was actually condemned, and his mode­rate property was confiscated to satisfy fictitious claims forcompensation.

The most.liberal principles in regard to freedom of traffic had madeItome great; and it was very little consonant to the spiritof the Roman institutions, that these new farmers wereperemptorily bound down to cultivate their portions ofland in a definite manner, and that their allotments weresubject to rights of revocation and all the cramping measuresassociated with a system of commercial restriction. ,
It will be granted that these objections to the Sempronianlaw were of no small weight. Yet they were not decisive.Such a practical disinheriting of the holders of the domainswas certainly a great evil; yet it was the only means ofchecking, at least for a long time, an evil much greater stilland in fact directly destructive to the state—the decline of theItalian farmer-class. We can well understand thereforewhy the most distinguished and patriotic men even of theconservative party, headed by Gaius Lslius and ScipiojEmilianus, approved and desired the distribution of thedomains viewed in itself.

men were once more armed. That all this could be donewithout the consuls, who were but a few miles off, learninganything of it, is not the least marvellous feature in this mar­vellous movement animated by a truly enthusiastic, and infact superhuman, national hatred. When at length the con­suls, weary of waiting, broke up from their camp at Utica, andthought that they should be able to scale the naked walls withladders, they found to their surprise and horror the battle­ments crowned anew with catapults, and the large populouscity, which they had hoped to occupy like an open village,able and ready to defend itself to the last man.
Carthage was rendered very strong both by the nature of situation ofits situation* and by the art of its inhabitants, who had very Carthage.frequently to depend on the protection of its walls. Intothe broad gulf of Tunis, which is bounded on the west byCape Farina and on the east by Cape Bon, there projects ina direction from west to east a promontory, which is encom­passed on three sides by the sea and is connected with themainland only towards the west. This promontory, at its nar­rowest piirt only about two miles broad and on the whole flat,again expands towards the gulf, and terminates there in thetwo heights of Jebel-Khawi and Sidi bu Said, between whichextends the plain of El Mersa. On its southern portionwhich ends in the height of Sidi bu Said lay the city ofCarthage. The pretty steep declivity of that height towardsthe gulf and its numerous rocks and shallows gave naturalstrength to the side of the city next to the gulf, and asimple circumvallation was sufficient there.

In the present epoch, when the opposi­tion of the government to Hellenism abated and therebythe outward reason for banishing the togata from the Romanstage was done away, the Terentian school rapidly tookpossession of this species of comedy also ; it was quite in ac­cordance with its spirit to naturalize Greek comedy in Italyon the one hand by faithful translation, and on the other

The chief representative90. of this school was Lucius Afranius (nourished about 660).The fragments of his comedies remaining give no distinctimpression, but they are not inconsistent with what theRoman critics of art remark regarding him. His nume­rous national comedies were in their construction thoroughlyformed on the model of the Greek intrigue-piece; only, aswas natural in imitation, they were simpler and shorter.In the details also he borrowed what pleased him partly fromMenander, partly from the older national literature. Butof the Latin local colouring, which is so distinctly marked inTitinius the creator of this species of art, we find not muchin Afranius; his subjects retain a very general character,and may have been throughout imitations of particularGreek comedies with merely an alteration of costume. Apolished eclecticism and adroitness in composition—literaryallusions not unfrequently occur—are characteristic of himas of Terence: the moral tendency too, in which his piecesapproximated to the drama, their inoffensive tenor in a policepoint of view, their purity of language are common to himwith the latter. Afranius is sufficiently indicated as of akindred spirit with Menander and Terence by the judgmentof posterity that he wore the toga as Menander would haveworn it had he been an Italian, and by his own expressionthat to his mind Terence surpassed all other poets.

Chap. XL] THE COMMONWEALTH AND ITS ECONOMY. 403


An approximate measure of the condition of Roman Thefinmicesfinance at this period is furnished, in the absence of definite aniJ publicstatements, first of all by the public buildings. In the bulldmgs.earlier portion of this epoch these were prosecuted on thegreatest scale, and the construction of roads in particularhad at no time been so energetically pursued. In Italy'the great southern highway of probably earlier origin, whichas a prolongation of the Appian road ran from Rome byway of Capua, Beneventum, and Venusia to the ports ofTarentum and Brundisium, had attached to it a branch-road from Capua to the Sicilian straits, a work of PubliusPopillius Rufus, consul in 622. On the east coast, where 132.hitherto only the section from Fanum to Ariminum hadbeen constructed as part of the Flaminian highway (ii. 83)the coast road was prolonged southward as far as Brundi­sium, northward by way of Hatria on the Po as far asAquileia, and the portion at least from Ariminum to Hatriawas formed by the Popillius just mentioned in the sameyear. The two great Etruscan highways—the coast orAurelian road from Rome to Pisa and Luna, which wasin course of formation in 631, and the Cassian road leading 123.by way of Sutrium and Clusium to Arretium and Florentia,which seems not to have been constructed before 583— X71.were probably first recognized at this time as Roman publichighways. About Rome itself new projects were not re­quired; but the Mulvian bridge (Ponte Molle), by whichthe Flaminian road crossed the Tiber not far from Rome,was in 645 reconstructed of stone. Lastly in Northern 109.Italy, which hitherto had possessed no other artificial roadthan the Flaminio-iEmilian terminating at Placentia, thegreat Postumian road was constructed in 606, which led 143.from Genua by way of Dertona, where probably a colony wasfounded at the same time, Placentia, where it joined theFlaminio-^Emilian road, Cremona and Verona to Aquileia,and thus connected the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas; towhich was added the communication established in 645 by 109.Marcus iEmilius Scaurus between Luna and Genua, whichconnected the Postumian road directly with Rome. GaiusGracchus exerted himself in another way for the improve­ment of the Italian roads. He secured the due repair ofthe great rural roads by assigning, on occasion of his distri­bution of lands, pieces of ground alongside of the roads, towhich was attached the obligation of keeping them in repair

dom combined with that of Pontus and, like the latter,mainly based on a number of Greek commercial towns. Itwas called the kingdom of the Bosporus; it embraced themodern Crimea with the opposite Asiatic promontory, andannually furnished to the royal chests ana magazines 200talents (£48,800) and 270,000 bushels of grain. The tribesof the steppe themselves from the north slope of the Cauca­sus to the mouth of the Danube entered, at least in greatpart, into relations of dependence on, or treaty with, thePontic king and, if they furnished him with no other aid,afforded at any rate an inexhaustible field for recruiting hisarmies.
While thus the most important successes were gainedtowards the north, the king at the same time extended hisdominions towards the east and the west. The LesserArmenia was annexed by him and converted from a de­pendent principality into an integral part of the Pontickingdom; but still more important was the close connectionwhich he formed with the king of the Greater Armenia.He not only gave his daughter Cleopatra in marriage toTigranes, but it was mainly through his support thatTigranes shook off the yoke of the Arsacida e and took theirplace in Asia. An agreement seems to have been madebetween the two to the effect, that Tigranes should take inhand to occupy Syria and the interior of Asia, and Mithra-dates Asia Minor and the coasts of the Black Sea, underpromise of mutual support; and it was beyond doubt themore active and abler Mithradates who brought about thisagreement with a view to cover his rear and to secure apowerful ally.

* The chronology of the following events can only be determined approxi­mately. Mithradates Eupator seems to have practically entered on the go­vernment somewhere about 640; Sulla's intervention took place in 662 (Liv.Ep. 70) with which accords the calculation assigning to the Mithradatic warsa period of thirty years (662-691) (Plin. H. N. vii. 26, 97). In the intervalfell the quarrels as to thePaphlagonianand Cappadocian succession, with whichthe bribery attempted by Mithradates in Rome (Diod. 631) apparently in thefirst tribunate of Saturninus in 651 (P. 207) was probably connected. Marias,who left Rome in 655 and did not remain long in the East, found Mithradatesalready in Cappadocia and negotiated with him regarding his aggressions (Cicad Brut. i. 5; Pint. Mar. 31); Ariarathes VI. had consequently been bythat time put to death.

The Cimbri requestedthat land might be assigned to them where they mightpeacefully settle—a request which certainly could not begranted. The consul instead of replying attacked them; hewas utterly defeated and the Roman camp was taken. Thenew levies which were occasioned by this misfortune werealready attended with so much difficulty, that the senate pro­cured the abolition of the laws—probably proceeding fromGaius Gracchus—which limited the obligation to militaryservice in point of time (P. 111). But the Cimbri, insteadof following up their victory over the Romans, sent to thesenate at Rome to repeat their request for the assignment ofland, and meanwhile employed themselves, apparently, in thesubjugation of the surrounding Celtic cantons. Thus theRoman province and the new Roman army were left for themoment undisturbed by the Germans; but a new enemyarose in Gaul itself. The Helvetii, who had suffered muchin the constant conflicts with their north-eastern neighbours,felt themselves stimulated by the example of the Cimbri toseek in their turn for more quiet and fertile settlements inwestern Gaul, and had perhaps, even when the Cimbrianhosts marched through their land, formed an alliance withthem for that purpose.

By this plan, in the first instance, a clear and fixed rule Better ar-was substituted for the irregular mode of distributing offices rangemeuthitherto adopted, a mode which invited all manner of vile buslness-manoeuvres and intrigues; and, secondly, the excesses ofmagisterial authority were as far as possible obviated andthe influence of the supreme governing board was materiallyincreased. According to the previous arrangement the onlylegal distinction in the empire was that drawn between thecity which was surrounded by the ring-wall, and the regionbeyond the pomerium; the new arrangement substituted forthe city the new Italy thenceforth, as in perpetual peace,withdrawn from the regular imperiumfi and contrasted with itthe continental and transmarine territories which, on the con­trary, were necessarily placed under military commandants—the provinces as they were henceforth called. According to Increase ofthe former arrangement the same man had very frequently the p»wirremained two, and often more years in the same office. The ,enew arrangement restricted the magistracies of the capitalas well as the governorships throughout to one year; and thespecial enactment that every governor should without failleave his province within thirty days after his successor'sarrival there, shows very clearly—particularly if we takealong with it the formerly mentioned prohibition of theimmediate re-election of the late magistrate to the same oranother public office—what the tendency of these arrange­ments was. It was the time-honoured maxim by which thesenate had at one time made the monarchy subject to it,that the limitation of the magistracy in point of functionswas favourable to democracy, and its limitation in point oftime favourable to oligarchy. According to the previousarrangement Gaius Marius had acted at once as head of thesenate and as commander-in-chief of the state; if he hadhis own unskilfulness alone to blame for his failure to over-

His skilful leadership, and still more hisclemency, speedily changed the position of affairs: Ocilis atonce surrendered to him; and even the Arevacae, confirmedby Marcellus in the hope that peace would be granted tothem on payment of a moderate fine, concluded an armisticeand sent envoys to Rome. Marcellus could thus proceed tothe southern province, where the Vettones and Lusitanianshad professed submission to the prsator Marcus Atilius solong as he remained within their bounds, but after hisdeparture had immediately revolted afresh and chastised theallies of Rome. The arrival of the consul restored tran­quillity, and, while he spent the winter in Corduba, hos­tilities were suspended throughout the peninsula. Mean­while the question of peace with the Arevacae was discussedat Rome. It is a significant indication of the relationsexisting among the Spaniards themselves, that the emissariesof the Roman party which existed among the Arevacse werethe chief occasion of the rejection of the proposals of peaceat Rome, by representing that, if the Romans were notwilling to sacrifice the Spaniards friendly to their interests,they had no alternative save either to send a consul witha corresponding army every year to the peninsula or tomake an emphatic example now. In consequence of this,the ambassadors of the Arevacae were dismissed without adecisive answer, and it was resolved that the war should beprosecuted with vigour. Marcellus accordingly found himselfcompelled in the following spring (603) to resume the war 151-against the Arevacae. But—either, as was asserted, from hisunwillingness to leave to his successor who was expectedsoon the glory of terminating the war, or, as is perhaps moreprobable, from his believing like Gracchus that a humanetreatment of the Spaniards was the first thing requisite for alasting peace—the Roman general after holding a secret con­ference with the most influential men of the Arevacae con­cluded a treaty under the walls of Numantia, by which theArevacae surrendered to the Romans at discretion, but werereinstated in their former stipulated rights on their under­taking to pay money and furnish hostages.

Iberians and Celts, Phoenicians,Hellenes, and Romans were there strangely intermingled.The most diverse kinds and stages of civilization subsistedthere simultaneously and at various points crossed each other,the ancient Iberian culture side by side with utter barbarism,the civilized relations of Phoenician and Greek mercantilecities side by side with the growth of a Latinizing culture,which was especially promoted by the numerous Italiansemployed in the silver mines and by the large standinggarrison. In this respect the Roman township of Italica(near Seville) and the Latin colony of Carteia (on the bay ofGibraltar) deserve mention, the latter being, next to Agri-gentum (ii. 150), the first transmarine civic community ofLatin tongue and Italian constitution. Italica was founded206. by Scipio the Elder, before he left Spain (548), for hisveterans who were inclined to remain in the peninsula—pro­bably not as a burgess-community, however, but merely as a171. market-place.* Carteia was founded in 583 and owed itsexistence to the multitude of camp-children—the offspringof Roman soldiers and Spanish slaves—who grew up as slavesde jure but as free Italians de facto, and were now manu­mitted on behalf of the state and constituted, along with theold inhabitants of Carteia, into a Latin colony. For nearly#7 , thirty years after the regulation of the province of the Ebroby Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (575, 576; ii. 211) theSpanish provinces, on the whole, enjoyed the blessings ofpeace undisturbed, although mention is made of one or twoexpeditions against the Celtiberians and Lusitanians.Lusi- [154.

intermediate between a city and a state had formed itself atleast in a natural way, the new Italia was nothing at allbut a place of congress for the insurgents, and it was bya pure fiction of law that the inhabitants of the peninsulawere stamped as burgesses of this new capital. But it issignificant, that in this case, where the sudden amalgama­tion of a number of isolated cantons into a new politicalunity might have so naturally suggested the idea of a repre­sentative constitution in the modern sense, no trace of anysuch idea occurs; in fact the very opposite course was fol­lowed,* and the communal organization was simply repro­duced in a far more absurd manner than before. Nowhereperhaps is it more clearly apparent than in this instance,that in the view of antiquity a free constitution was in­separable from the appearance of the sovereign people inperson in their collective assemblies or from a civic type,and that the great fundamental idea of the modern republi­can-constitutional state, viz., the expression of the sove­reignty of the people by a representative assembly—thatidea without which a free state would be a chaos—is whollymodern. Even the Italian polity, although it approximatedto a free state in its somewhat representative senates andin the diminished importance of the comitia, never wasable either in the case of Rome or Italia to cross theboundary-line.
Thus began, a few months after the death of Drusus, in Warlikethe winter of 663-4 the struggle—as one of the coins of the prepaxa-insurgents represents it—of the Sabellian ox against the tlOQil90Roman she-wolf.

That thesenate of Italia was meant to be formed in another manner and to have dif­ferent powers from that of Home, has been asserted, but has not been proved.Of course in its first composition care must have been taken to have a repre­sentation in some degree uniform of the insurgent cities; but that the senatorswere intended to he regularly deputed by the communities, is nowhere stated.As little does the commission given to the senate to draw up a constitution ex­clude its promulgation by the magistrates and ratification by the assembly ofthe people.

376 [Book IV. THE SULLAN CONSTITUTION.


Relation ofthe muni'cipiurn tothe state.


With reference to the relation of this secondary politicalorganism to the primary organism of the state, all politicalprerogatives generally belonged to the former as well as to thelatter, and consequently the municipal decree and the impe-rium of the municipal magistrates bound the municipal bur­gess just as the decree of the people and the consular imperiumbound the Roman. This led, on the whole, to a co-ordinateexercise of power by the authorities of the state and of thetown; both had, for instance, the right of valuation and tax­ation, so that in the case of any municipal valuations andtaxes those prescribed by Bome were not taken into ac­count, and vice versa; public buildings might be institutedboth by the Roman magistrates throughout Italy and bythe municipal authorities in their own district, and so inother cases. In the event of collision, of course the com­munity yielded to the state and the decree of the people in­validated the municipal decree. A formal division of func­tions probably took place only in the administration of jus­tice, where the system of pure co-ordination would have ledto the greatest confusion. In criminal procedure probablyall capital causes, and in civil procedure those more difficultcases which presumed an independent action on the part ofthe presiding magistrate, were reserved for the authoritiesand jurymen of the capital, and the Italian municipal courtswere restricted to the minor and lesS complicated lawsuitsor to those which were very urgent.Rise of the The origin of this Italian municipal system has not beenmunidprnm. recorded. It is probable that its germs may be traced toexceptional regulations for the great burgess-colonies, whichwere founded at the end of the sixth century (ii. 333); atleast several, in themselves indifferent, formal differencesbetween burgess-colonies and burgess-municipia tend to showthat the.new burgess-colony, which at that time practicallytook the place of the Latin, had originally a better positionin state-law than the far older buTgess-municipium, and theadvantage can perhaps have only consisted in a municipalconstitution approximating to the Latin, such as afterwardsbelonged to all burgess-colonies and burgess-municipta. Thenew organization is first distinctly traceable in the revolu­tionary colony of Capua (P. 325) ; and it admits of no doubtthat it was first fully applied, when all the hitherto sove­reign towns of Italy had to be organized, in consequence ofthe Social War, as burgess-communities.

As, more­over, both the extraordinarily admitted senators and thequaestors were nominated by the comitia tributa, the senate,hitherto resting indirectly on the choice of the people (i.335), was now thoroughly based on direct popular election;and thus made as close an approach to a representativegovernment as was compatible with the nature of the oligarchyand the notions of antiquity generally. The senate had incourse of time been converted from a corporation intendedmerely to advise the magistrates into a board commanding themagistrates and self-governing; it was only a consistent ad­vance in the same direction, when the right of nominatingand cancelling senators originally belonging to the magis­trates was withdrawn from them, and the senate wasplaced on the same legal basis on which the magistrates'power itself rested. The extravagant prerogative of thecensors to revise the list of the senate and to erase or addnames at pleasure was iu reality incompatible with anorganized oligarchic constitution. As provision was nowmade for a sufficient regular recruiting of its ranks by theelection of the quaestors, the censorial revisions becamesuperfluous; and by their abeyance the essential principle atthe bottom of every oligarchy, the irremoveable character andlife-tenure of the members of the ruling order who obtainedseat and vote, was definitively consolidated.
In respect to legislation Sulla contented himself with re- Regulation*viving the regulations made in 666, and securing to the "j *° C88-senate the legislative initiative, which had long belonged to '^»^ur"it practically, by legal enactment at least as against the tri-bunes.

were enabled to extend their excursions as far as the Medi­terranean, and to pillage even the territory of the Bastulo-Phoenicians not far from the Roman capital New Carthage(Cartagena). The Romans at home took the matter soseriously as to resolve on sending a consul to Spain, a stepwhich had not been taken since 559; and, in order to 195-accelerate the despatch of aid, they even made the newconsuls enter on office two months and a half before thelegal time. For this reason the day for the consuls enteringon office was shifted from the 15th of March to the 1st ofJanuary ; and thus was established the beginning of the yearwhich we still make use of at the present day. But, beforethe consul Quintus Fulvius Nobilior arrived with his army,a very serious encounter took place on the right bank of theTagus between the praetor Lucius Mummius, governor ofFurther Spain, and the Lusitanians, now led after the fall ofPunicus by his successor Caesarus (601). Fortune was at 153.first favourable to the Romans; the Lusitanian army wasbroken and their camp was taken. But the Romans, alreadyfatigued by their march and falling out of their ranks in thedisorder of the pursuit, were at length completely defeatedby their already vanquished antagonists, and lost their owncamp in addition to that of the enemy, as well as 9000dead.
The flame of war now blazed forth far and vide. The CeltiberianLusitanians on the left bank of the Tagus, led by Cancamus, war.threw themselves on the Celtici subject to the Romans(in Alentejo), and took their town Conistorgis. The Lusi­tanians sent the standards taken from Mummius to theCeltiberians at once as an announcement of victory and asummons to arms; and among these, too, there was no wantof ferment. Two small Celtiberian tribes in the neighbour­hood of the powerful Arevacae (near the sources of thePouro and Tagus), the Belli and the Titthi, had resolved tosettle together in Segeda, one of their towns. While theywere occupied in building the walls, the Romans orderedthem to desist, because the Sempronian regulations prohibitedthe subject communities from founding towns at their owndiscretion; and they at the same time required the contribu­tion of money and men which was due by treaty but for aconsiderable period had not been demanded. The Spaniardsrefused to obey either command, alleging that they were en­gaged merely in enlarging, not in founding, a city, and that

Themost important of these settlements were the free city ofChersonesus (not far from Sebastopol), built on the territoryof the Scythians in the Tauric peninsula (Crimea), and main­taining itself in moderate prosperity under circumstancesfar from favourable by virtue of its good constitution andthe public spirit of its citizens; and Pauticapaeum (Kertch)at the opposite side of the peninsula on the straits leadingfrom the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov, governed since the•297. year 457 u.c. by hereditary burgomasters, afterwards calledkings of the Bosporus, the Archaeanactidae, Spartocidae,and Paerisadae. The culture of corn and the fisheries of theSea of Azov had rapidly raised the city to prosperity. Itsterritory still in the time of Mithradates embraced the lessereastern division of the Crimea including the town of Theo-dosia, and on the opposite Asiatic continent the town ofPhanagoria and the district of Sindice. In better times thelords of Pauticapaeum had ruled the peoples on the east coastof the Sea of Azov and the valley of the Kuban, and hadcommanded the Black Sea with their fleet; but Pauticapaeumwas no longer what it had been. Nowhere was the saddecline of the Hellenic nation felt more deeply than at thesedistant outposts. Athens in its good times had been theonly Greek state which fulfilled there the duties of a lead­ing power—duties which certainly were specially broughthome to the Athenians by their need of Pontic grain.After the downfall of the Attic maritime power these regionswere, on the whole, left to themselves. The Greek land-powers never succeeded in any serious intervention there,although Philip the father of Alexander and Lysimachussometimes attempted it; and the Romans, on whom withthe conquest of Macedonia and Asia Minor devolved thepolitical obligation of becoming the strong protectors ofGreek civilization at the point where it needed such protec­tion, utterly neglected the summons of interest as well ofhonour. The fall of Sinope, the decline of Rhodes, com­pleted the isolation of the Hellenes on the northern shoreof the Black Sea.

He had spoken in the open market of thebriberies practised in Rome by the envoys of King Mith-radates—these revelations, compromising in the highest de­gree the senate, had wellnigh cost the bold tribune his life.He had excited a tumult against the conqueror of Numidia,Quintus Metellus, when he was a candidate for the censor­ship in 652, and kept him besieged in the Capitol till the 102.equites liberated him not without bloodshed ; the retaliatorymeasure of the censor Metellus—the expulsion with infamy ofSaturninus and of Glaucia from the senate on occasion of therevision of the senatorial roll-—had only miscarried throughthe remissness of the colleague assigned to Metellus. Satur­ninus mainly had carried that exceptional commission againstCaepio and his associates (P. 188) in spite of the vehementresistance of the government-party ; and in opposition to thesame he had carried the keenly contested re-election ofMarius as consul for 652. Saturninus was decidedly the 102.most energetic enemy of the senate and the most active andeloquent leader of the popular party since Gams Gracchus;but he was also violent and unscrupulous beyond any ofhis predecessors, always ready to descend into the streetand to refute his antagonist with blows instead of words.
Such were the two leaders of the so-called popular party,who now made common cause with the victorious general.

A\'e must never lose sight of the re­action exercised by these social evils on political life, if wewould understand the Roman revolution.

At length they go themselves to the judgment-seat, just early enough not to bring the process down ontheir own neck.

assemblies, the comitia, though they were far from dealingstrictly with the point of qualification, it was on the wholeburgesses alone that appeared, in the mere popular assem­blages on the other hand—the contiones—every one in theshape of a man was entitled to take his place and to shout,Egyptians and Jews, street-boys and slaves. Such a "meet­ing " certainly had no significance in the eyes of the law; itcould neither vote nor decree. But it practically ruled thestreet, and already the opinion of the street was a powerin Rome, so that it was of some importance whether thisconfused mass received the communications made to it withsilence or shouts, whether it applauded and rejoiced, orhissed and howled at the orator. Not many had the courageto lord it over the populace as Scipio ./Emiliauus did, whenthey hissed him on account of his expression as to the deathof his brother-in-law. "Ye," he said, " to whom Italy is notmother but step-mother, ought to keep silence!" and whentheir fury grew still louder, "surely you do not think that Iwill fear those let loose, whom 1 sent in chains to theslave-market?"
That the rusty machinery of the comitia should be madeuse of for the elections and for legislation, was bad enough.But when those masses—the comitia primarily, and practi­cally also the contiones—were permitted to interfere in theadministration, and the instrument which the senate em­ployed to prevent such interferences was wrested out of itshands; when this so-called burgess-body was allowed todecree to itself lands and all their appurtenances out ofthe public purse; when any one, whom circumstances andhis influence with the proletariate enabled to command thestreets for a few hours, found it possible to impress on hisprojects the legal stamp of the sovereign people's will, Romehad reached not the beginning, but the end of popular freedom—had arrived not at democracy, but at monarchy. For thatreason, in the previous period Cato and those who shared hisviews never brought such questions before the burgesses, butdiscussed them only in the senate (ii. 359). For that reason,Gracchus' contemporaries, the men of the Scipionic circle,described the Flaminian agrarian law of 522—the first step 232iu that fatal career—as the beginning of the decline of Romangreatness. For that reason, they allowed the author of thedomain-distribution to fall, and saw in his dreadful end as itwere a means of warding off similar attempts in future, whileyet they maintained and turned to account with all their

on the course traced out by Gaius Gracchus for procuringsupremacy in the state by taking upon himself its constitu­tional magistracies. In this enterprise he found himselfdependent for support on what was called the popular party,and sought his allies in its leaders for the time being all themore, that the victorious general by no means possessed thegifts and experiences requisite for the command of the streets.Thus the democratic party after long insignificance suddenlyregained political importance. It had in the long intervalfrom Gaius Gracchus to Marius materially deteriorated.The dissatisfaction with the senatorial government was notnow perhaps less than it was then; but several of the hopes,which had brought to the Gracchi their most faithful ad­herents, had in the meanwhile been recognized as illusory,and there had sprung up in many minds a misgiving thatthis Gracchan agitation tended towards an issue whither avery large portion of the discontented were by no meanswilling to follow it. In fact, amidst the chase and turmoilof twenty years there had been rubbed off and worn awayvery much of the fresh enthusiasm, the steadfast faith, themoral purity of effort, which mark the early stages ofrevolutions. But, if the democratic party was no longerwhat it had been under Gaius Gracchus, the leaders of theintervening period were now as far beneath their party asGaius Gracchus had been exalted above it. This was im­plied in the nature of the case. Until there should emergea man having the boldness like Gaius Gracchus to graspat the supremacy of the state, the leaders could only bestop-gaps; either political novices, who gave furious ventto their youthful love of opposition and then, when dulv ac­credited as fiery declaimers and favourite speakers, effectedwith more or less dexterity their retreat to the camp of thegovernment-party; or people, who had nothing to lose inrespect of property and influence and little usually eitherto gain or lose in respect of honour, and who made it theirbusiness to obstruct and annoy the government from per­sonal exasperation or even from the mere pleasure of creatinga noise. To the former sort belonged, for instance. GaiusMemmius (P. 148) and the well-known orator Lucius Crassus,who turned the oratorical laurels which they had won in theranks of the opposition to account in the sequel as zealouspartisans of the government.

Of more importance than these measures of revenge was Mariusthe question how the dangerous war beyond the Alps was commandvrto be further carried on, and first of all to whom the su- m"chie*.


now inform us, that a law proposed by Lucius Appuleius Saturninusbrought about this catastrophe. This is evidently no other than the Appuleianlaw as to the minuta majestas of the Korean state (Cic. de Or. ii. 25, 107;49, 201), i. e. the proposal of Saturninus for the appointment of an extraordi­nary commission to investigate the treasons that had taken place during theCimbrian troubles. The commission of inquiry as to the gold of Tolosa (Cic.de N. D. iii. 30, 74), arose out of the Appuleian law, in the very same waj- asthe special courts of inquiry—further mentioned in that passage—as to a scan­dalous bribery of judges out of the Mucian law of 613, as to the occurrences 141.with the Vestals out of the Peducaean law of 641, and as to the Jugurthine war H'3.out of the Mamilian law of 644. A comparison of these cases also shows that 110.in such special commissions—different in this respect from the ordinary ones—even punishments affecting life and limb might be and were inflicted. Thefact that elsewhere the tribune of the people, Gaius Norbanus, is named as theperson who set agoing the proceedings against Caipio and was afterwardsbrought to trial for doing so (Cic. de Or. ii. 40, 167; 48, 199; 49, 200;Or. Part. 30,105, et al.) is not inconsistent with the view given above; forthe proposal proceeded as usual from several tribunes of the people (ad Herenn.i. 14, 24 ; Cic. de Or. ii. 47, 197), and, as Saturninus was already dead whenthe aristocratic party was in a position to think of retaliation, they fastenedon his colleague. As to the period of this second and final condemnation ofCsepio, the usual very inconsiderate hypothesis, which places it in 659, ten 95.
years after the battle of Arausio, has been already rejected. It rests simply onthe fact that Crassus when consul, consequently in 659, spoke in favour of Caepio 95,(Cic. Brut. 44, 162) ; which, however, he manifestly did not as his advocate,but on the occasion when Norbanus was brought to account by Publins SulpiciusRufus for his conduct toward Caepio in 659. Formerly we placed this second 95.accusation in 650; now that we know that it originated from a proposal of 94.Saturninus, we can only hesitate between 651, when he was tribune of the 103.people for the first time (Plutarch, Mar. 14; Oros. v. 17 ; App. i. 28; Diodor.p. 608, 631), and 654, when he held that office a second time. There are not 100.materials for deciding the point certainly, but the great preponderance of pro­bability is in favour of the former year; partly because it was nearer to thedisastrous events in Gaul, partly because in the tolerably full accounts of thesecond tribunate of Saturninus there is no mention of Quintus Caepio thefather and the acts of violence directed against him. The circumstance, thatthe sums paid back to the treasury in consequence of the decisions as to theembezzlement of the Tolosan booty were claimed by Saturninus in his secondtribunate for his schemes of colonization (De Viris III. 73, 5, and thereonOrelli, Ind. Leg. p. 137), is not in itself decisive, and may, moreover, havebeen easily transferred by mistake from the first African to the second generalagrarian law of Saturninus.
The fact that afterwards, when Norbanus was impeached, his impeachmentproceeded on the very ground of the law which he had taken part in suggest­ing, was an ironical incident common in the Roman political procedure of thisperiod (Cic. Brut. 89, 305) and should not mislead us into the belief thatthe Appuleian law was, like the later Cornelian, a general law of high treason.

No doubt the principle189. on which the peace of 565 with Syria was based, viz., thatthe Halys and the Taurus should form the eastern boun­dary of the Roman dependencies (ii. 276), was not adheredto by the senate and was in its very nature untenable.The political horizon rests on illusion as well as the phy­sical; the facts, that the state of Syria had the numberof ships of war and war-elephants allowed to it prescribedin the treaty ot peace (ii. 274), and that the Syrian armyevacuated Egypt when half-won at the bidding of theRoman senate (ii. 309), impKed the most complete recogni­tion of hegemony and dependence. Accordingly the dis­putes as to the throne in Syria and in Egypt were referredfor settlement to the Roman government. In the former164. after the death of Antiochus Epiphanes (590) Demetriusafterwards named Soter, the son of Seleucus IV., living asa hostage at Rome, and Antiochus Eupator, a minor, the sonof the last king Antiochus Epiphanes, contended for the181-146. crown; in the latter Ptolemy Philometof (573-608), theelder of the two brothers who had reigned jointly since170. 164. 584, had been driven from the country (590) by the younger117.

he justified with unworthy sophistry. But it was not inthis step that the moral and political mistake of Gracchus'action lay. There are no set forms of high treason in history;whoever provokes one power in the state to conflict withanother is certainly a revolutionist, but he may be at thesame time a sagacious and praiseworthy statesman. Theessential defect of the Gracchan revolution lay in a factonly too frequently overlooked—in the nature of the thenexisting burgess-assemblies. The agrarian law of SpuriusCassius (i. 288) and that of Tiberius Gracchus had in themain the same tenor and the same object; but the enter­prises of the two men were as diverse, as the former Romanburgess-body which shared the Volscian spoil with theLatins and Hernici was different from the present whicherected the provinces of Asia and Africa. The former wasa civic community, which could meet together and acttogether; the latter was a great state, the union of whosemembers in one and the same collective assembly, and theleaving to this assembly the decision, yielded a result aslamentable as it was ridiculous (ii. 342). The fundamentaldefect of the policy of antiquity—that it never fully advancedfrom the civic form of constitution to that of a state or, whichis the same thing, from the system of collective assembliesto a parliamentary system—in this case avenged itself. Thesovereign assembly of Rome was, what the sovereign assemblyin England would be, if instead of sending representativesall the electors of England should meet together as a parlia­ment—an unwieldy body wildly agitated by all interests andall passions, in which intelligence was totally lost; a bodywhich was neither able to take a comprehensive view ofthings nor even to form a resolution of its own ; a body, aboveall, in which, saving in rare exceptional cases, a couple ofhundred or thousand individuals accidentally picked up fromthe streets of the capital acted and voted in name of the bur­gesses. The burgesses found themselves, as a rule, nearlyas satisfactorily represented by their actual representativesin the tribes and centuries as by the thirty lictors who legallyrepresented them in the curies ; and just as what was calledthe decree of the curies was nothing but a decree of the magis­trate who convoked the lictors, so the decree of the tribesand centuries at this time was in substance simply a decreeof the proposing magistrate, legalized by some consentientsassembled for the occasion.

(consul in 652), once in better days the associate of the 102.most glorious victory and triumph of that same Marius, whonow had no other answer for the suppliant relatives of hisaged colleague than the monosyllabic order, " he must die."
The originator of all these outrages was Gaius Marius. The lastHe designated the victims and the executioners—only in daya ofexceptional cases, as in those of Merula and Catulus, llarlU8-was any form of law observed; not unfrequently a glanceor the silence with which he received those who salutedhim formed the sentence of death, which was always executedat once. His revenge was not satisfied even with the deathof his victim; he forbade the burial of the dead bodies; hegave orders—anticipated, it is true, in this respect by Sulla—that the heads of the senators slain should be fixed to therostra in the Forum; he ordered particular corpses to hedragged through the Forum, and that of Gaius Caesar to bestabbed afresh at the tomb of Q.uintus Varius, whom Caesarprobably had once impeached (P. 247); he publicly em­braced the man who delivered to him as he sat at table thehead of Antonius, whom he had been with difficulty restrainedfrom seeking out in his hiding-place and slaying with hisown hand. His legions of slaves, and in particular a divi­sion of Ardyaeans (P. 176), chiefly served as his executioners,and did not neglect, amidst these Saturnalia of their newfreedom, to plunder the houses of their former masters andto dishonour and murder all whom they met with there.His own associates were in despair at this insane fury;Sertorius adjured the consul to put a stop to it at any price,and even Cinna was alarmed. But in times, such as thesewere, madness itself becomes a power; man hurls himselfinto the abyss, to save himself from giddiness. It was noteasy to restrain the furious old man and his bands, and leastof all had Cinna the courage to do so; on the contrary, hechose Marius as his colleague in the consulship for the nextyear. The reign of terror alarmed the more moderate of thevictors not much less than the defeated party; the capitalistsalone were not displeased to see that another hand lent itselfto the work of thoroughly humbling for once the haughtyoligarchs, and that at the same time, in consequence of theextensive confiscations and auctions, the best part of thespoil came to themselves—in these times of terror they ac­quired from the people the surname of the "hoarders."

Numbers thus fell—-including not a few decidedadherents of the oligarchy—as the victims of private hos­tility or of their riches: the fearful confusion, and the cul­pable indulgence which Sulla displayed in this as in everyinstance towards those more closely connected with, him,prevented any punishment even of the ordinary crimes thatwere perpetrated amidst the disorder.

♦ions. Sulla from political considerations sought to induce the
respectable burgesses to take part in its purchase; a greatportion of them, moreover, voluntarily pressed forward, andnone more zealously than the young Marcus Crassus.Under the existing circumstances the utmost depreciationwas inevitable, a depreciation which to some extent could notbut result from the Roman plan of selling the property con­fiscated by the state for a round sum payable in ready money.Moreover, the regent did not forget himself; while his wifeMetella more especially and other persons high and lowclosely connected with him, even freedmen and boon-com­panions, were sometimes allowed to purchase without compe­tition, sometimes had the purchase-money wholly or par­tially remitted. One of his freedmen, for instance, is said tohave purchased a property of 6,000,000 sesterces (£61,100)for 2000 (£20 12s.), and one of his subalterns is said tohave acquired by such speculations an estate of 10,000,000sesterces (£102,700). The indignation was great and just;even during Sulla's regency an advocate asked, whether thenobility had waged civil war solely for the purpose of en­riching their freedmen and slaves. But in spite of this de­preciation the whole proceeds of the confiscated estatesamounted to not less than 350,000,000 sesterces (£3,050,000),which gives a tolerable idea of the enormous extent of theseconfiscations falling chiefly on the wealthiest portion of theburgesses. It was altogether a fearful visitation. Therewas no longer any process or any pardon; mute terror laylike a weight of lead on the land, and free speech wassilenced in the market-place alike of the capital and of thecountry-town.

pressions jestingly borrowed from the Greek. Terenceknows nothing of such caprices; his dialogue moves on withthe purest symmetry, and its points are elegant epigrammaticand sententious turns. The comedy of Terence is not to becalled an improvement, as compared with that of Plautus,either in a poetical or in a moral point of view. Originalitycannot be affirmed of either, but, if possible, still less ofTerence; and the dubious praise of more correct copying isat least outweighed by the circumstance that, while theyounger poet reproduced the agreeableness, he knew not howto reproduce the merriment of Menander, so that the come­dies of Plautus imitated from Menander, such as the Stichus,the Cistellaria, the Bacchides, probably preserve far more ofthe flowing charm of the original than the comedies of the"dimidiatus Menander." And, while the aesthetic critic can­not recognize an improvement in the transition from thecoarse to the dull, as little can the moralist in the transitionfrom the obscenity and indifference of Plautus to the accom­modation-morality of Terence. But in point of language animprovement certainly took place. Elegance of language wasthe pride of the poet, and it was owing above all to its in­imitable charm that the most refined judges of art in after-times, such as Cicero, Caesar, and Quinctiliau, assigned thepalm to him among all the Roman poets of the repub­lican age. In so far it is perhaps justifiable to date a newera in Roman literature—the real essence of which lay not inthe development of Latin poetry, but in the development ofthe Latin language—from the comedies of Terence as thefirst artistically pure imitation of Hellenic works of art.The modern comedy made its way amidst the most deter­mined literary warfare. The Plautine style of composing hadtaken root among the Roman bourgeoisie; the comedies ofTerence encountered the liveliest opposition from the public,which found their " insipid language," their " feeble style,"intolerable. The apparently somewhat sensitive poet repliedin his prologues—which properly were not intended for anysuch purpose—with counter-criticisms full of defensive andoffensive polemics; and appealed from the multitude, whichhad twice run off from his Hecyra to witness a band ofgladiators and rope-dancers, to the cultivated circles of thegenteel world. He declared that he only aspired to the ap­proval of the "good;" in which doubtless there was not want­ing a hint, that it was not at all seemly to undervalue works

The rivalry of the two gene­ral who were not only political antagonists, but were also
set at variance in a military point of view by the so differentresults of the two campaigns of the previous year—brokeout immediately after the battle in the most offensive form.Catulus might with justice assert, that the centre divisionwhich he commanded had decided the victory, and that histroops had captured thirty-one standards, while those ofMarius had brought in only two; his soldiers led even thedeputies of the town of Parma through the heaps of thedead to show to them that Marius had slain his thousand,but Catulus his ten thousand. Nevertheless Marius was re­garded as the real conqueror of the Cimbri, and justly; notmerely because by virtue of his higher rank he had held thechief command on the decisive day, and was in military giftsand experience beyond doubt far superior to his colleague,but especially because the second victory at Vercellae wasin fact rendered possible only by the first victory at AquaeSextiae.

of the tribune of the people Gaius Mamilius Limetanus, inspite of the timid attempts of the senate to avert thethreatened punishment, an extraordinary jury-commissionwas appointed to investigate the high treason that hadoccurred in connection with the question of the Numidiansuccession; and its sentences sent the two former com­manders in chief Gaius Bestia and Spurius Albinus as wellas Lucius Opimius, the head of the first African commissionand the executioner withal of Gaius Gracchus, along withnumerous other less notable men of the government party,guilty and innocent, into exile. That these prosecutions,however, were only intended to appease the excitement ofpublic opinion, in the capitalist circles more especially, bythe sacrifice of some of the persons chiefly compromised, andthat there was in them not the slightest trace of a revoltagainst the aristocracy or aristocratic government in itself,is shown very clearly by the fact that no one ventured toattack the guiltiest of the guilty, the prudent and powerfulScaurus; on the contrary he was about this very timeelected censor and also, incredible as it may seem, chosenas one of the presidents of the extraordinary commission oftreason. Still less was any attempt even made to inter­fere with the functions of the government, and it was leftsolely to the senate to put an end to the Numidian scandalin a manner as gentle as possible for the aristocracy; forthat it was time to do so, even the most aristocratic aristo­crat probably began to perceive.Cancelling The senate in the first place cancelled the second treatyof the of peace—to surrender to the enemy the commander whosecond had concluded it, as was done some thirty years before,seemed according to the new ideas of the sanctity of trea­ties no longer necessary—and determined, this time in allearnest, to renew the war.

restoration nothing further than a relapse of the state-machine into the old track which had been beaten and wornfor centuries. Restoration is always revolution; and in thiscase it was not so much the old government as the oldgovernor that was restored. The oligarchy made its appear­ance newly equipped in the armour of the tyrannis whichhad been overthrown. As the senate had beaten Gracchusfrom the field with his own weapons, so it continued in themost essential points to govern with the constitution of theGracchi; though certainly with the secret intention, if notof setting it aside entirely, at any rate of thoroughly purgingit in due time from the elements really hostile to the rulingaristocracy.Piosecu- At first the reaction was mainly directed against persons,
tions of the Public Popillius was recalled from banishment after the
'enactments relating to him had been cancelled (633), and a
warfare of prosecution was waged against the adherents ofGracchus; whereas the attempt of the popular party tohave Lucius Opimius after his resignation of office condemnedfor high treason was frustrated by the partisans of the120. government (634). The character of this government of therestoration is significantly indicated by the progress of thearistocracy in soundness of opinion. Gaius Carbo, once theally of the Gracchi, had for long been a convert (P. 106), andhad but recently shown his zeal and his usefulness asdefender of Opimius. But he remained a renegade: whenthe democrats raised the same accusation against him asagainst Opimius, the government were not unwilling to lethim fall, and Carbo, seeing himself lost between the twoparties, died by his own hand. Thus the men of the reac­tion showed themselves in personal questions pure aristo­crats. But the reaction did not immediately attack the dis­tributions of grain, the taxation of the province of Asia, orthe Gracchan arrangements as to the jurymen and the tri­bunals; on the contrary, it not only spared the mercantileclass and the proletariate of the capital, but continued torender homage, as it had already done in the introductionof the Livian laws, to these powers and especially to theproletariate far more decidedly than had been done by theGracchi. This course was not adopted merely because theGracchan revolution retained a hold on the minds of its con­temporaries and protected its creations; the fostering andcherishing of the interests of the populace at least by the

Now that themarvellous good fortune of Rome had once more been evincedin the rapid collapse of the Italian insurrection, this Asiaticwar just beginning was, notwithstanding "b^its being mixedup with the expiring Italian struggle, not of a really danger­ous character; and the less so, because Mithradates in his ar­rogance refused the invitation of the Italians that he shouldafford them direct assistance. Still it was in a high degreeinconvenient. The times had gone by, when they withouthesitation carried on simultaneously an Italian and a trans­marine war; the state-chest was already after two years ofwar utterly exhausted, and the formation of a new army inaddition to that already in the field seemed scarcely prac­ticable. But they resorted to such expedients as they could.The sale of the sites that had from ancient times (i.115) re­mained unoccupied on and near the citadel to persons desirousof building, which yielded 9000 pounds of gold (£360,000),furnished the requisite pecuniary means. No new army wasformed, but that which was under Sulla in Campania wasdestined to embark for Asia, as soon as the state of thingsin southern Italy should allow its departure; which mightbe expected, from the progress of the army operating in thenorth under Strabo, to happen soon.88. So the third campaign in 666 began amidst favourable
Ihird cam- prospects for Rome. Strabo put down the last resistancepa,gn' which was still offered in the Abruzzi.

his contemptuous and pert mode of treating religious mattersis altogether offensive. The narrative, preserving throughoutan intentional contrast to the usual Greek historiographywith its artistic style, is correct and clear, but flat and languid,digressing with undue frequency into polemical discussionsor into biographical, not seldom very self-sufficient, de­scription of his own experiences. A controversial veinpervades the whole work; the author destined his treatiseprimarily for the Romans, and yet found among them onlya very small circle that understood him; he felt that heremained in the eyes of the Romans a foreigner, in the eyesof his countrymen a renegade, and that with his grand con­ception of his subject he belonged more to the future thanto the present. Accordingly he was not exempt from acertain ill-humour and personal bitterness, which frequentlyappear after a quarrelsome and paltry fashion in his attacksupon the superficial or even venal Greek and the uncriticalRoman historians, so that he degenerates from the tone ofthe historian to that of the reviewer. Polybius is not anattractive author; but as truth and truthfulness are ofmore value than all ornament and elegance, no other authorof antiquity perhaps can be named to whom we are indebtedfor so much real instruction. His books are like the sun inthe field of Roman history; at the point where they beginthe veil of mist which still envelops the Samnite andPyrrhic wars is raised, and at the point where they end anew and, if possible, still more vexatious twilight begins.Roman In singular contrast to this grand conception and treat-

As early as 622 the consul of that year, PubliusPopillius, the same who presided over the prosecutions of theadherents of Tiberius Gracchus, recorded on a public monu­ment that he was "the first who had turned the shepherdsout of the domains and installed farmers in their stead;"and tradition otherwise affirms that the distribution ex­tended over all Italy, and that in the formerly existingcommunities the number of farms was everywhere aug­mented—for it was the design of the Sempronian agrarianlaw to elevate the farmer-class not by the founding of newcommunities, but by the strengthening of those already inexistence. The extent and the comprehensive effect of thesedistributions are attested by the numerous arrangementsin the Roman art of land-measuring referable to theGracchan assignations of land: for instance, the due placingof boundary-stones so as to obviate future mistakes appearsto have been first suggested by the Gracchan courts fordefining boundaries and by the distributions of land. But thenumbers on the burgess-rolls give the clearest evidence. The

Whether it multipliedthe Italian farms in the same proportion may be doubted;at any rate what it did accomplish yielded a great andbeneficent result. It is true that this result was notachieved without various violations of respectable interestsand existing rights. The allotment-commission, composedof the most decided partisans, and absolute judge in its owncause, proceeded with its labours in a reckless and hastymanner; public notices summoned every one who was ableto do so to give information regarding the extent of thedomain-lands; the old land-registers were inexorably referredto, and not only was occupation new and old revokedwithout distinction, but in various cases actual private pro­perty, as to which the holder was unable satisfactorily toprove his tenure, was also confiscated.

on the Italian side six, on the Roman side five, lieutenant-commanders, each of whom conducted the attack or defencein a definite district, whereas the consular armies weredestined to act more freely and to strike the decisive blow.The most esteemed Roman officers, such as Gaius Marius,Quintus Catulus, and the two consulars of experience inthe Spanish war, Titus Didius and Publius Crassus, placedthemselves at the disposal of the consuls for these posts;and, though the Italians had not names so celebrated tooppose to them, yet the result showed that their leaders werein a military point of view nowise inferior to the Romans.
The offensive in this thoroughly desultory war was on thewhole on the side of the Romans, but was nowhere deci­sively assumed even on their part. It is surprising that theRomans did not collect their troops for the purpose of at­tacking the insurgents with a superior force, and that theinsurgents made no attempt to advance into Latium and tothrow themselves on the hostile capital. "We are however toolittle acquainted with their respective circumstances tojudge whether or how they could have acted otherwise,or to what extent the remissness of the Roman govern­ment on the one hand and the looseness of the connectionamong the federate communities on the other contributedto this want of unity in the conduct of the war. It is easyto see, that with such a system there would be victories anddefeats but the final settlement might be very long delayed;and it is no less plain, that a clear and vivid picture of such awar—which resolved itself into a series of engagements onthe part of individual corps operating at the same time,sometimes separately, sometimes in combination—cannot beprepared out of the remarkably fragmentary accounts whichhave reached us.

body had retained for more than a hundred and fifty years,they were far from including a capitulation with the actualinsurgents; they were on the contrary intended partly toretain the communities that were wavering and threateningto revolt, partly to draw over as many deserters as possiblefrom the hostile ranks. To what extent these laws andespecially the most important of them—that of Caesar—wereapplied, cannot be accurately stated, as we are only able tospecify in general terms the extent of the insurrection atthe time when the law was issued. The chief result at anyrate was, that the communities hitherto Latin,—not only thesurvivors of the old Latin confederacy, such as Tibur andPraeneste, but more especially the Latin colonies, with theexception of the few that passed over to the insurgents—were thereby admitted to Roman citizenship. Besides, thelaw was applied to the isolated towns of the allies betweenthe Po and the Apennines, such as Ravenna, to a number ofEtruscan towns, and to the allied cities that remained faithfulin Southern Italy, such as Nuceria and Neapolis. It wasnatural that individual communities, hitherto specially privi­leged, should hesitate as to the acceptance of the fran­chise; that Neapolis, for example, should scruple to give upits former treaty with Rome— which guaranteed to itscitizens exemption from land-service and their Greek con­stitution, and perhaps domanial advantages besides—for thevery restricted privileges of new burgesses. It was probablyin virtue of conventions concluded on account of thesescruples, that this city, as well as Rhegium and perhapsother Greek communities in Italy, even after their admissionto Roman citizenship retained unchanged their former com­munal constitution and Greek as their official language.At all events, as a consequence of these laws, the circle ofRoman burgesses was extraordinarily enlarged by the merg­ing into it of numerous and important civic communitiesscattered from the Sicilian straits to the Po; and, further, thecountry between the Po and the Alps was, by the bestowalof the privileges of the most favoured allies, as it were in­vested with the legal reversion of full citizenship.
On the strength of these concessions to the wavering Second yearcommunities, the Romans resumed with fresh courage the of the war.conflict against the insurgent districts.

G2 THE SUBJECT COUNTRIES. [Book IV.


The Par- Of still more importance in the sequel than this insurrec-thianem- tion of the Israelites was the contemporary movement—1ih-e. probably originating from the same cause—in the eastern
provinces, where Antiochus Epiphanes emptied the templesof the Persian gods just as he had emptied that at Jerusalem,and doubtless accorded no better treatment to the adherentsof Ahuramazda and Mithra than to those of Jehovah. Justas in Judaea—only with a wider range and ampler propor­tions—the result was a reaction on the part of the nativemanners and the native religion against Hellenism and theHellenic gods; the promoters of this movement were theParthians, and out of it arose the great Parthian empire.The "Parthwa," or Parthians, who are early met with asone of the numerous tribes merged in the great Persianempire, living first of all in the modern Khorasan to the south-250. east of the Caspian sea, appear after 500 as an independentstate under the Scythian, i. e. Turanian, dynasty of theArsacidae. This state, however, only emerged from itsobscurity about a century afterwards. The sixth Arsaces,175-136. Mithradates I. (579 ?-618 P), was the real founder of thegreat Parthian power. The Bactrian empire, in itself far morepowerful, but already shaken to the very foundation partly byhostilities with the hordes of Scythian horsemen from Turanand with the states of the Indus, partly by internal dis­orders, succumbed to him. He achieved almost equalsuccesses in the countries to the west of the great desert.The Syrian empire was just then in the utmost disorganiza­tion, partly through the failure of the Hellenizing attempts ofAntiochus Epiphanes, partly through the troubles as to thesuccession that occurred after his death; and the provincesof the interior were in full course of breaking off fromAntioch and the region of the coast. In Commagene forinstance, the most northerly province of Syria on theCappadocian frontier, the satrap Ptolemaeus asserted hisindependence, as did also on the opposite bank of theEuphrates the prince of Edessa in northern Mesopotamiaor the province of Osroene, and the satrap Timarchus inthe important province of Media; in fact the latter got hisindependence confirmed by the Roman senate, and, sup­ported by Armenia as his ally, ruled as far down as Seleucia

Emphaticcontempt for constitutional formalism in connection with avivid appreciation of the intrinsic value of existing arrange­ments, clear perceptions, and praiseworthy intentions markthis legislation throughout. But it bears also a certain frivo­lous and superficial character; it needed in particular a greatamount of good nature to believe, that the fixing a maximumof interest would remedy the complications of debtor andcreditor, and that the right of previous deliberation on thepart of the senate would prove more capable of resistingfuture demagogism than the right of veto and religion hadpreviously been.New com- In reality new clouds very soon began to overcast theplications, clear sky of the conservatives.

rogues, in Terence again, as a rule, among none but honestmen; if occasionally a leno is plundered or a young mantaken to the brothel, it is done with a moral intent, possiblyout of brotherly love or to deter the boy from frequentingimproper haunts. In the Plautine pieces there predomi­nates the characteristic antagonism of the tavern to thehouse; everywhere wives are visited with abuse, to the de­light of all husbands temporarily emancipated and not quitesure of an amiable salutation at home. In the comediesof Terence there prevails not a more moral, but a morebecoming conception of the feminine nature and of marriedlife. As a rule, they end with a virtuous marriage or ifpossible with two—just as it was the glory of Menanderthat he had compensated for every seduction by a marriage.The eulogies of a bachelor life, which are so frequent inMenander, are repeated by his Roman remodeller only withcharacteristic shyness,* whereas the lover in his agony,the tender husband at the accouchement, the loving sisterby the death-bed in the Eunuchus and the Andria are verygracefully delineated ; in the Hecyra there even appears at theclose as a delivering angel a virtuous courtesan, likewise agenuine Menandrian figure, which the Roman public, it istrue, very properly hissed. In Plautus the fathers through­out only exist for the purpose of being jeered and swindledby their sons; with Terence in the Heautontimorumenos thelost son is reformed by the wisdom of his father, and, as ingeneral he is full of excellent instructions as to education, sothe point of the best of his pieces, the Adelphi, turns onfinding the right mean between the too liberal trainingof the uncle and the too rigorous training of the father.Plautus writes for the great multitude and gives utteranceto profane and sarcastic speeches, so far as the censorship ofthe stage at all allowed; Terence on the contrary describesit as his aim to please the good and, like Menander, tooffend nobody. Plautus is fond of vigorous, often noisy dia­logue, and his pieces require the liveliest play of gesture inthe actors; Terence confines himself to "quiet conversa­tion." The language of Plautus abounds in burlesque turnsand verbal witticisms, in alliterations, in comic coinages ofnew terms, Aristophanic combinations of words, slang ex-

coast of the Atlantic Ocean.* Truthfulness is his nature.In all great matters he has no interest for one state or againstanother, for this man or against that, but is singly and solelyinterested in the essential connection of events, to presentwhich in their true relation of causes and effects seemsto him not merely the first but the sole task of the historian.Lastly, the narrative is a model of completeness, simplicity,and clearness. Still all these uncommon advantages by nomeans constitute an historian of the first rank. Polybiusgrasps his literary task, as he grasped his practical, withgrandeur of intellect, but with the intellect alone. History,the struggle of necessity and liberty, is a moral problem;Polybius treats it as if it were a mechanical one. Thewhole alone has value for him, in nature as in the state; theparticular event, the individual man, however wonderful theymay appear, are yet properly mere single elements, insignifi­cant wheels in the highly artificial mechanism which receivesthe name of the state. So far Polybius was certainly qua­lified as no other was to narrate the history of the Romanpeople, which actually solved the marvellous problem ofraising itself to unparalleled internal and external great­ness without producing a single statesman of genius in thehighest sense, and which resting on its simple foundationsdeveloped itself with wonderful almost mathematical con­sistency. But the element of moral freedom is active in thehistory of every people; and it was not neglected by Polybiusin the history of Rome with impunity. His treatment of allquestions, in which right, honour, religion are involved, isnot merely shallow, but radically false. The same holds truewherever a genetic construction is required; the purelymechanical attempts at explanation, which Polybius substi­tutes, are sometimes altogether desperate; there is hardly,for instance, a more foolish political speculation than thatwhich derives the excellent constitution of Rome from ajudicious mixture of monarchical, aristocratic, and democraticelements, and deduces the successes of Rome from the excel­lence of her constitution. His conception of relations iseverywhere dreadfully jejune and destitute of imagination:

Butthe reign of terror presented an appearance only the morehorrible, when it proceeded from the conservative side andwas in some measure devoid of passion; the commonwealthseemed all the more irretrievably lost, when the frenzy andthe crime on both sides were equally balanced.
In regulating the relations of Italy and of the capital, Mairte-Sulla—although he generally in other instances treated as nance ofnull all state-acts done during the revolution excepting in thebnrgess-the transaction of current business—firmly adhered to the nSnt?

In thecase of the freedmen alone the unrestricted right of suffragewas again withdrawn, and the old state of matters was re­stored. To the aristocratic ultras this might seem a greatconcession; Sulla perceived that it was necessary to wrestthese mighty levers out of the hands of the revolutionarychiefs, and that the rule of the oligarchy was not materiallyendangered by increasing the number of the burgesses.
But with this concession in principle was combined a Punish-most rigid inquisition, conducted by special commissioners ments in-with the co-operation of the garrisons distributed through- fllct?d »"out Italy, in respect to particular communities in all com^..ardistricts of the land.

But on their quarrelling with eachother they were obliged to yield to Gaius Fabius Hadrianus,the governor appointed by the revolutionary government.Asia was in the hands of Mithradates; consequently theprovince of Macedonia, so far as it was in Sulla's power,remained the only asylum of the exiled oligarchy. Sulla'swife and children who had with difficulty escaped death,and not a few senators who had made their escape, soughtrefuge there, so that a sort of senate was soon formed athis head-quarters. The government did not fail to issue Measuresdecrees against the oligarchical proconsul.

But these new burgesses were to berestricted in a way similar to the freedmen, inasmuch asthey could only be enrolled in eight, as the freedmen only infour, of the thirty-five tribes; whether the restriction" waspersonal or, as it would rather seem, hereditary, cannot bedetermined with certainty.Bestowal of This measure related primarily to Italy proper, which atLatin rights that time extended northward little beyond Ancona andon.. e Florence. In Cisalpine Gaul, which was in the eye of theCelts. law a foreign country, but in administration and colonization
had long passed as part of Italy, all the Latin colonies weretreated like the Italian communities. Of the other hithertoallied townships in that quarter those—not very numerous—situated on the south side of the Po received the franchise;but the country between the Po and the Alps was in con-89. sequence of a law brought in by the consul Strabo in 665differently treated. It was organized after the Italian civicconstitution, so that the communities not adapted for this,more especially the townships in the Alpine valleys, wereassigned to particular towns as dependent and tributaryvillages. These new town-communities, however, were notpresented with the Roman franchise, but, by means of thelegal fiction that they were Latin colonies, were invested withthose rights which had hitherto belonged to the Latin towns ofinferior privileges. Thus Italy at that time ended practicallyat the Po, while the Transpadane country was treated asan outlying dependency; undoubtedly because the regionbetween the Apennines and the Po had long been organizedafter the Italian model, whereas in the more northerlyportion,—in which, excepting Eporedia and Aquileia, therewere no civic or Latin colonies, and from which in fact thenative tribes had been by no means dislodged as they werefrom the southern district—Celtic habits and the Celtic can­tonal constitution still in great part subsisted.

It is to be regretted, that we no longer suffi­ciently discern in the superficial accounts handed down tous the causes of this sudden revolution. While undoubtedlythe dexterous leadership of Strabo and still more of Sulla,the more energetic concentration of the Roman forces, andtheir quicker offensive action contributed materially to thatresult, political causes were probably at work along with themilitary in producing the singularly rapid fall of the insurgents'power; the law of Silvanus and Carbo probably fulfilled itsdesign in carrying defection and treason to the commoncause into the ranks of the enemy, and misfortune, as hasso frequently happened, probably fell as an apple of discordamong the loosely connected insurgent communities.

Unfortunatelytruth requires us to add, that of all the Roman nobles notmore than three—-and these not including the legislators• themselves—are said to have complied with these imposinglaws; and in the case of these three it was the law of theStoa, and not that of the state, that curtailed the bill of fare.Silver plate. It is worth while to dwell for a moment on the luxury thatwent on increasing in defiance of these laws as respectssilver plate. In the sixth century silver plate for the tablewas, with the exception of the traditionary silver salt-dish, ararity; the Carthaginian ambassadors jested over the cir­cumstance, that at every house to which they were invitedthey had encountered the same silver plate (ii. 21). ScipioJEmilianus possessed not more than 32 pounds (£130) in
121. wrought silver; his nephew Quintus Fabius (consul in 633)first brought his plate up to 1000 pounds (£4025), Marcus
91- Drusus (tribune of the people in 663) reached 10,000 pounds(£40,250); in Sulla's time there were already counted in thecapital about 150 silver state-dishes weighing 100 poundseach, several of which brought their possessors into thelists of proscription. To judge of the sums expended onthese, we must recollect that the workmanship was paid forat enormous rates; for instance, Gaius Gracchus paid forchoice articles of silver fifteen times, and Lucius Crassus,
9.5. consul in 659, eighteen times the value of the metal, and thelatter gave for a pair of cups by a noted silversmith 100,000sesterces (£1050). So it was in proportion everywhere.Marriage. How it fared with marriage and the rearing of children,is shown by the Gracchan agrarian laws, which first placeda premium thereon (P. 90). Divorce, formerly in Romealmost unheard of, was now a daily occurrence; while in theoldest Roman marriage the husband had purchased hiswife, it might have been proposed to the noble Romans ofthe present times that, with the view of bringing the nameinto accordance with the reality, they should introducemarriage for hire..

ing the vanguard of the praetor Gaius Plautius, Viriathushad the skill to lure him over to the right bank of the Tagus,and there to defeat him so emphatically that the Romangeneral went into winter quarters in the middle of summer—on which account he was afterwards charged before thepeople with having disgraced the Roman community, andwas compelled to live in exile. In like manner the armyof the governor Claudius Unimanus was destroyed, that ofGaius Negidius was vanquished, and the level country waspillaged far and wide. Trophies of victory, decorated withthe insignia of the Roman governors and the arms of thelegions, were erected on the Spanish mountains; peopleat Rome heard with shame and consternation of the vic­tories of the barbarian king. The conduct of the Spanishwar was now committed to a more trustworthy officer, theconsul Quintus Fabius Maximus JSmilianus, the second sonof the victor of Pydna (609). But the Romans no longer 145.ventured to send the experienced veterans, who had just re­turned from Macedonia and Asia, forth anew to the detestedSpanish war; the two legions, which Maximus brought withhim, were recent levies and scarcely more to be trustedthan the old utterly demoralized Spanish army. After thefirst conflicts had again issued favourably for the Lusita-nians, the prudent general kept together his troops for theremainder of the year in the camp at Urso (Osuna, south­east from Seville) without accepting the enemy's offer ofbattle, and only took the field afresh in the following year(610), after his troops had been qualified for fighting by 144.pettier warfare; he was then enabled to maintain the supe­riority, and after successful feats of arms went into winterquarters at Corduba. But when the cowardly and incapablepraetor Quinctius took the command in room of Maximus, theRomans again suffered defeat after defeat, and their generalin the middle of summer shut himself up in Corduba, whilethe bands of Viriathus overran the southern province (611). 143.

After the manner of soldiers he was notnice, but was fond of his cups, especially in his later years;he knew not the art of giving feasts, and kept a bad cook. Itwas likewise awkward that the consular understood nothingbut Latin and had to decline conversing in Greek; that hefelt the Greek plays wearisome might pass—he was probablynot the only one who did so—but to confess his feeling ofweariness was naive. Thus he remained throughout life acountryman adrift among aristocrats, and annoyed by thekeenly felt sarcasms and still more keenly felt sympathyof his colleagues, which he had not the self-command todespise as he despised themselves.Political Marius stood aloof from parties not much less than from
position of society. The measures which he carried in his tribunate of119 tke People (635)—a better control over the delivery of thevoting-tablets with a view to do away with the scandalousfrauds that were therein practised, and the prevention of ex­travagant proposals for largesses to the people (P. 134)—donot bear the stamp of a party, least of all that of the demo­cratic, but merely show that he hated what was unjust andirrational; and how could a man like this, a farmer by birthand a soldier by inclination, have been from the first a revo­lutionist? The hostile attacks of the aristocracy had nodoubt driven him subsequently into the camp of the opponentsof the government; and there he speedily found himselfelevated in the first instance to be general of the opposi­tion, and thereby destined perhaps for still higher things.But this was far more the effect of the stringent force ofcircumstances and of the general need which the oppositionhad for a chief, than his own work; he had at any rate since107-6. his departure for Africa in 647-8 hardly tarried, in passing,for a brief period in the capital.

The Romans did not interfere in these com- Cyreueplications; in fact, when the Cyrenaean kingdom fell to Roman,them in 658 by the testament of the childless king Apion, B6.while not directly rejecting the acquisition, they left thecountry in substance to itself by declaring the Greek townsof the kingdom, Cyrene, Ptolemais, and Berenice, free citiesand even handing over to them the use of the royal domains.The supervision of the governor of Africa over this territorywas from its remoteness merely nominal, far more so thanthat of the governor of Macedonia over the Hellenic freecities. The consequences of this measure—which beyonddoubt originated not in Philhellenism, but simply in theweakness and negligence of the Roman government—weresubstantially similar to those which had occurred under thelike circumstances in Hellas; civil wars and usurpationsso rent the land that, when a Roman officer of rank acci­dentally made his appearance there in 668, the inhabitants 86.urgently besought him to regulate their affairs and toestablish a permanent government among them.

except that the Italian nation in this respect persevered inan inactivity bordering on barbarism. They destroyed theCorinthian factories, the depositaries of so many valuableindustrial traditions—not however that they might establishsimilar factories for themselves, but that they might buyup at extravagant prices such Corinthian vases of earthen­ware or copper and similar " antique works" as were pre­served in Greek houses. The trades that were still somewhatprosperous, such as those connected with building, were pro­ductive of hardly any benefit for the commonwealth, becausehere too the system of employing slaves interposed in everymore considerable undertaking: in the construction ofthe Marcian aqueduct, for instance, the government con­cluded contracts at once for building and materials with3000 master-tradesmen, each of whom then performed thework contracted for with his band of slaves.Money- The most brilliant, or rather the only brilliant, side of
dealing and Roman private economics was money-dealing and commerce<commerce. First of all stood the leasing of the domains and of thetaxes, through which a large, perhaps the larger part of theincome of the Roman state flowed into the pocket of theRoman capitalists. The money-dealings, moreover, through­out the range of the Roman state were monopolized by theRomans; every penny circulated in Gaul, it is said in awriting issued soon after the end of this period, passesthrough the books of the Roman merchants, and so it wasdoubtless everywhere. The co-operation of a rude economiccondition and of the unscrupulous employment of Rome'spolitical ascendancy for the benefit of the private interestsof every wealthy Roman rendered a usurious system ofinterest universal, as is shown for example by the treat­ment of the war-tax imposed by Sulla on the province of84.

augmented by the fact, that he had as consul ventured on anattempt to wrest the office of jurymen from the capitalists(P. 135). On his account the old venerable principle, that thesacredness of the magistracy should be respected even in theperson of its worst occupant, was violated; and, while thecensure due to the author of the calamitous day of Cannaehad been silently repressed within the breast, the author ofthe defeat of Arausio was by deeree of the people unconsti­tutionally deprived of his proconsulship, and—what hadnot occurred since the crises in which the monarchy had105. perished—his property was confiscated by the state (649 ?).Not long afterwards he was by a second decree of the bur-
104. gesses expelled from the senate (650). But this was notenough; more victims were desired, and above all Caepio'sblood. A number of tribunes of the people favourable tothe opposition, with Lucius Appuleius Saturninus and Gaius
103. Norbanus at their head, proposed in 651 to appoint an ex­traordinary judicial commission in reference to the embezzle­ment and treason perpetrated in Gaul; in spite of thepractical abolition of imprisonment previous to trial and ofthe punishment of death for political offences, Caepio wasarrested and the intention of pronouncing and executing inhis case sentence of death was openly expressed. The govern­ment party attempted to get rid of the proposal by tri-bunician intervention; but the interceding tribunes wereviolently driven from the assembly, and in the furioustumult the first men of the senate were assailed withstones. The investigation could not be prevented, and the
103. War of prosecutions pursued its course in 651 as it had donesix years before; Ca^pio himself, his colleague in the su­preme command Gnaeus Mallius Maximus, and numerousother men of note were condemned: a tribune of the people,who was a friend of Caepio, with difficulty succeeded by thesacrifice of his own civil existence in saving, at least, thelife of the chief person accused.*


* The deposition from office of the proconsul Caepio, with which was combinedthe confiscation of his property (Liv. Ep. 67), was probably pronounced bythe assembly of the people immediately after the battle of Arausio (6th Oc-

him till the Teutones were defeated. The leaders of thedifferent parties in the civil war, Marius, Octavius, Sulla,coincided in believing omens and oracles. During its courseeven the senate was under the necessity, in the troubles of667, of consenting to issue directions in accordance withthe fancies of a crazy prophetess. It is significant of theossification of the Romano-Hellenic religion as well as ofthe increasing craving of the multitude after stronger reli­gious stimulants, that superstition no longer, as in theBacchic mysteries, associates itself with the national religion;even the Etruscan mysticism is already left behind; theworships matured in the sultry regions of the East appearthroughout in the foremost rank. The copious introductionof elements from Asia Minor and Syria into the populationpartly by the importation of slaves, partly by the augmentedtraffic of Italy with the East, contributed very greatly tothis result. The power of these foreign religions is verydistinctly apparent in the revolts of the Sicilian slaves, whofor the most part were natives of Syria. Eunus vomitedfire, Athenion read the stars; the plummets thrown by theslaves in these wars bear in great part the names of gods,those of Zeus and Artemis, and especially that of the myste­rious Mother who had migrated from Crete to Sicily and waszealously worshipped there. A similar effect was producedby commercial intercourse, particularly after the wares ofBerytus and Alexandria were conveyed directly to theItalian ports; Ostia and Puteoli became the great martsnot only for Syrian unguents and Egyptian linen, but alsofor the faith of the East. Everywhere the mingling 'of reli­gions was constantly on the increase along with the minglingof nations. Of all allowed worships the most popular wasthat of the Pessinuntine Mother of the Gods, which made adeep impression on the multitude by its eunuch-celibacy,its banquets, its music, its begging processions, and all itssensuous pomp; the collections from house to house werealready felt as an economic burden. In the most dangeroustime of the Citnbrian war Battaces the high-priest of Pessi-nus appeared in person at Rome, in order to defend theinterests of the temple of his goddess there which was allegedto have been profaned, addressed the Soman people by thespecial orders of the Mother of the Gods, and performedalso various miracles.

118 THE REVOLUTION AND GAIUS GRACCHUS. [Book IV.


the senate—the arbitrary fixing of the functions of thetwo consuls on each occasion—was not withdrawn from it; butthe indirect pressure hitherto exercised in this way over thesupreme magistrates was neutralized by the fact, that thesenate was instructed to settle these functions before theconsuls concerned were elected. With unrivalled activity,lastly, Gaius concentrated the most varied and most com­plicated functions of government in his own person. Hehimself watched over the distribution of grain, selected thejurymen, founded the colonies in person notwithstandingthat his magistracy legally chained him to the city, regulatedthe highways and concluded building-contracts, led the discus­sions of the senate, settled the consular elections—in short,he accustomed the people to the fact that one man wasforemost in all things, and threw the lax and lame ad­ministration of the senatorial college into the shade by thevigour and dexterity of his personal rule.
Gracchus interfered with the jurisdiction, still more ener­getically than with the administration, of the senate. Wehave already mentioned that he set aside the senators fromtheir ordinary judicial functions; the same course was takenwith the jurisdiction, which the senate as the supreme admi­nistrative board assumed in exceptional cases. Undersevere penalties he prohibited—apparently in his renewalof the law de provocatione*—the appointment of extraordinarycommissions of high treason by decree of the senate, such asthat which after his brother's murder had sat in judgmenton his adherents. The effect of these measures was, that thesenate wholly lost the power of control, and retained only somuch of administration as the head of the state thought fitto leave to it. But these organic measures were not enough;the governing aristocracy for the time being was also directlyassailed. It was a mere act of revenge, which assigned re­trospective effect to the last-mentioned law, and by virtueof it compelled Publius Popillius—the aristocrat who afterthe death of Nasica, which had occurred in the interval,was chiefly obnoxious to the democrats—to leave thecountry. It is remarkable that this proposal was onlycarried by eighteen to seventeen votes in the assembly ofthe tribes—a sign how much the influence of the aristocracystill availed with the multitude, at least in questions of a per-

To him moreover, or at any rate tothe allotment-commission, the custom of erecting milestonesappears to be traceable as well as that of marking thelimits of fields by regular boundary-stones. Lastly heprovided for good vice vicinales, with the view of thereby pro­moting agriculture. But of still greater moment was theconstruction of the imperial highways in the provinces,which beyond doubt began in this epoch. The Domitianhighway after long preparations (ii. 198) furnished a secureland-route from Italy to Spain, and was closely connectedwith the founding of Aquae Sextiae and Narbo (P. 170); theGabinian (P. 177) and the Egnatian (P. 43) led from theprincipal places on the east coast of the Adriatic sea—theformer from Salona, the latter from Apollonia and Dyrra-chium—into the interior. Of the origin of these works no"mention is to be found in the fragmentary tradition of thisepoch, but they were nevertheless undoubtedly connectedwith the Gallic, Dalmatian, and Macedonian wars of thisage, and came to be of the greatest importance for the cen­tralization of the state and the civilizing of the subjugatedbarbarian districts.
In Italy at least great works of drainage were prosecuted
160. as well as the formation of roads. In 594 the drying of thePomptine marshes—a vital matter for Central Italy—wasset about with great energy and at least temporary success;
] 09. in 645 the draining of the low-lying lands between Parma andPlacentia was effected in connection with the construction ofthe north Italian highway. Moreover, the government didmuch for the Roman aqueducts, as indispensable for thehealth and comfort of the capital as they were costly. Notonly were the two that had been in existence since the years312. 262. 442 and 492—the Appian and the Anio aqueducts—tho-
144. roughly repaired in 610, but two new ones were formed; theMarcian in 610, which remained afterwards unsurpassed forthe excellence and abundance of the water, and the Calida,as it was called, nineteen years later. The power of theRoman exchequer to execute great operations by means ofpayments in pure cash without making use of the system ofcredit, is very clearly shown by the way in which the Marcianaqueduct was created: the sum required for it of 180,000,000sesterces (in gold nearly £2,000,000) was raised and appliedwithin three years.

burial. On landing in Italy he had earnestly offered toforgive and to forget, and no one who came to make hispeace had been rejected. Even after the first successes hehad negotiated in this spirit with Lucius Scipio; it was therevolutionary party, which had not only broken off thesenegotiations, but had subsequently, at the last moment be­fore their downfall, resumed the massacres afresh and morefearfully than ever, and had in fact conspired with the oldenemies of their country for the destruction of the city ofBome. The cup was now full. By virtue of his newofficial authority Sulla, immediately after assuming theregency, outlawed as enemies of their country all the civiland military officers who had taken an active part in favourof the revolution after the convention with Scipio whichaccording to Sulla's assertion was validly concluded, andsuch of the other burgesses as had in any marked way aidedits cause. Whoever killed one of these outlaws was notonly exempt from punishment like an executioner dulyfulfilling his office, but also obtained for the execution acompensation of 12,000 denarii (£488); any one on thecontrary who befriended an outlaw, even the nearest rela­tive, was liable to the severest penalty. The property ofthe proscribed was forfeited to the state like the spoil ofan enemy; their children and grandchildren were excludedfrom a political career, and yet, so far as they were of sena­torial rank, were bound to undertake their share of senatorialburdens. The last enactments also applied to the estatesand the descendants of those who had fallen in conflict forthe revolution—penalties, which went even beyond those en­joined by the earliest law in the case of such as had borne armsagainst their fatherland. The most terrible feature in thissystem of terror was the indefiniteness of the proposed cate­gories, against which there was immediate remonstrance inthe senate, and which Sulla himself sought to remedy bydirecting the names of the proscribed to be publicly postedup and fixing the 1st June 673 as the final term for closing 81.the lists of proscription.

treroely oppressive burden imposed upon the state by theobligation under which Gaius Gracchus placed it to furnishcorn at nominal rates to the burgesses of the capital, wascertainly counterbalanced at first by the newly-openedsources of income in the province of Asia. Neverthelessthe public buildings seem from that time to have almostcome to a standstill. While the public works which can beshown to have been constructed from the battle of Pydnadown to the time of Gaius Gracchus were numerous, from122. the period after 632 there is scarcely mention of any otherthan the projects of bridges, roads, and drainage which109. Marcus jEmilius Scaurus organized as censor in 645. Itmust remain a moot point whether this was the effect of thelargesses of grain or, as is perhaps more probable, the con­sequence of the system of increased savings, such as befitteda government which became daily more and more a rigid oli­garchy, and such as is indicated by the statement that the91. Soman reserve reached its highest point in 663. The ter­rible storm of insurrection and revolution, in combinationwith the five years' deficit of the revenues of Asia Minor,was the first serious trial to which the Roman finances weresubjected after the Hannibalic war: they failed to sustainit. Nothing perhaps so clearly marks the difference of thetimes, as the circumstance that in the Hannibalic war itwas not till the tenth year of the struggle, when the bur­gesses were almost sinking under taxation, that the reservewas touched (ii. 174); whereas the Social war was from thefirst supported by the balance in hand, and when this wasexpended after two campaigns to the last penny, they pre­ferred to sell by auction the public sites in the capital(P. 254) and to seize the treasures of the temples (P. 334)rather than levy a tax on the burgesses. The storm however,severe as it was, passed over; Sulla, at the expense doubt­less of enormous economic sacrifices imposed on the subjectsand Italian revolutionists in particular, restored order to thefinances and, by abolishing the largesses of corn and retain­ing although in a reduced form the Asiatic revenues,'secured for the commonwealth a satisfactory economic con­dition, at least in the sense of the ordinary expenditureremaining far below the ordinary income.Private In the private economics of this period hardly any new

163. years before (591) they had been obliged to release fromtheir league the iEtolian town of Pleuron (ii. 279); nowthey were directed to renounce all the acquisitions whichthey had made since the second Macedonian war—viz.,Corinth, Orchomenus, Argos, Sparta in the Peloponnesus,and Heraelea near Oeta—and to reduce their league to thecondition in which it stood at the end of the Hannibalic war.When the Achaean deputies learned this, they rushed im­mediately to the market-place without even hearing theRomans to an end, and communicated the Roman demandsto the multitude; whereupon the governing and the go­verned rabble determined with one voice to arrest at oncethe whole Lacedaemonians present in Corinth, becauseSparta forsooth had brought on them this misfortune. Thearrest accordingly took place in the most tumultuary fashion,so that the possession of Laconian names or Laconianshoes appeared sufficient ground for imprisonment: in factthey even entered the dwellings of the Roman envoys toseize the Lacedaemonians who had taken shelter there, andsevere expressions were uttered against the Romans, althoughthey did not lay hands on their persons. The envoys re­turned home in indignation, and made bitter and evenexaggerated complaints in the senate; but the latter, withthe same moderation which marked all its measures againstthe Greeks, confined itself at first to representations. Inthe mildest form, and hardly mentioning satisfaction for theinsults which they had suffered, Sextus Julius Caesar re­peated the commands of the Romans at the diet in 2Egium
147. (sPring of 607). But the leaders of affairs in Achaia withthe new strategus Critolaus at their head (strategus from147-140. May 607 to May 608), as men versed in state affairs andfamiliar with political arts, merely drew from that fact theinference that the position of Rome with reference to Car­thage and Viriathus could not but be very unfavourable,and continued at once to cheat and to affront the Romans.Caesar was requested to arrange a conference of deputies ofthe contending parties at Tegea for the settlement of thequestion. He did so; but, after Caesar and the Lacedaemoniandeputies had waited there long in vain for the Achaean s,

historical compromise between the two ruling rations issilently completed; the Greek and Latin nationalities con­clude mutual peace. The Greeks renounce their exclusive-ness in the field of culture, the Romans in the field ofpolitics; in instruction Latin is allowed to stand on afooting of equality—restricted, it is true, and imperfect—with Greek: on the other hand Sulla first allows foreignambassadors to speak Greek before the Roman senate with­out an interpreter. The time heralds its approach, whenthe Roman commonwealth will pass into a bilingual stateand the true heir of the throne and the ideas of Alexanderthe Great will arise in the West, at once a Roman and aGreek.
The suppression of the secondary, and the mutual inter-penetration of the two primary nationalities, which are thusapparent on a general survey of national relations, nowfall to be more precisely exhibited in detail in the severalfields of religion, national education, literature, and art.Religion. The Roman religion was so intimately interwoven with the
Roman commonwealth and the Roman household—so tho­roughly in fact the pious reflection of the Roman bur­gess world—that the political and social revolution neces­sarily overturned also the fabric of religion. The ancientItalian popular faith fell to the ground; over its ruins rose—like oligarchy and despotism rising over the ruins of thepolitical commonwealth—on the one side unbelief, state-reli­gion, Hellenism, and on the other side superstition, sectarian­ism, the religion of the Orientals. The germs certainly ofboth, as indeed the germs of the politico-social revolution also,may be traced back to the previous epoch (ii. 399-405). Eventhen the Hellenic culture of the higher circles was secretlyundermining their ancestral faith; Ennius introduced theallegorical and historical theories of the Hellenic religion intoItaly; the senate, which subdued Hannibal, had to sanctionthe transference of the worship of Cybele from Asia Minorto Rome, and to take the most serious steps against other stillworse superstitions, particularly the Bacchanalian scandal.But; as during the preceding period the revolution generallywas rather preparing in men's minds than assuming outwardexpression, so the religious revolution was, in substanceat any rate, the work only of the Gracchan and Sullan age.(ireek phi- Let us endeavour first to trace the tendencies associatedlosophy. with Hellenism.

number of their most trusty partisans to the vengeance ofthe multitude, or to assume collectively the responsibilityof the outrage: the latter course was adopted. Theygave an official sanction to the assertion that Gracchus hadwished to seize the crown, and justified this latest crimeby the primitive precedent of Ahala (i. 301); in fact,they even committed the duty of further investigation asto the accomplices of Gracchus to a special commission,and made its head, the consul Publius Popillius, take carethat a sort of legal stamp should be supplementarily im­pressed on the murder of Gracchus by bloody sentencesdirected against a large number of inferior persons (622). 132.Nasica, against whom above all others the multitude breathedvengeance, and who had at least the courage openly toavow his deed before the people and to defend it, was-under honourable pretexts despatched to Asia, and soonafterwards (624) invested, during his absence, with the 130.office of Pontifex Maximus. Nor did the moderate partydissociate themselves from these proceedings of their col­leagues. Gaius Laelius bore a part in the investigationsadverse to the partisans of Gracchus; Publius Scaevola, whohad attempted to prevent the murder, afterwards defendedit in the senate; when Scipio -3£milianus, after his returnfrom Spain (622), was challenged publicly to declare 132.whether he did or did not approve the killing of his brother-in-law, he gave the at least ambiguous reply that, so far asTiberius, had aspired to the crown, he had been justly put todeath.

The appointment of an official com- questionmission, which had to counteract the continual diminution yle^ed lnof the farmer-class by the continual establishment of newsmall holdings from the resources of the state, was doubtlessno sign of a healthy condition of the national economy; but itwas, under the existing circumstances political and social, ajudicious measure. The distribution of the domains, more­over, was in itself no political parjy-question; it might havebeen carried out to the last sod, without changing the exist­ing constitution or at all shaking the government of thearistocracy. As little could there be, in that case, any com­plaint of a violation of rights.

If theRomans, as seems to have been the case, believed what theydesired and confided in the calm which for the moment pre­vailed, they were soon to learn that the younger generationin Hellas was in no respect better or wiser than the older.The Greeks directly sought an opportunity of picking aquarrel with the Romans.
In order to screen a foul transaction, Diaeus, the president Achainnof the Achaean league for the time being, about 605 threw war- [149-out in the diet the assertion, that the separate privileges con­ceded by the Achaean league to the Lacedaemonians as mem­bers—viz., their exemption from the Achaean criminal juris­diction, and the right to send separate embassies to Rome—were not at all guaranteed to them by the Romans. It wasan audacious falsehood; but the diet naturally believed whatit wished, and, when the Achaeans showed themselves readyto make good their assertions with arms in hand, the weakerSpartans yielded for the time, or, to speak more correctly, thosewhose surrender was demanded by the Achaeans left thecity to appear as complainants before the Roman senate. Thesenate answered as usual that it would send a commission toinvestigate the matter; but instead of reporting this replythe envoys stated in Achaia as well as in Sparta, and inboth cases falsely, that the senate had decided in their favour.The Achaeans, who felt more than ever their equalitywith Rome as allies and their political importance onaccount of the aid which the league had just rendered inThessaly against the Pseudo-Philip, advanced in 606 under 148.their strategus Damocritus into Laconia: in vain a Romanembassy on its way to Asia, at the suggestion of Metellus,admonished them to keep the peace and to await the com­missioners of the senate. A battle took place, in whichnearly 1000 Spartans fell, and Sparta might have been takenif Damocritus had not been equally incapable as an officer andas a statesman. He was superseded, and his successorDiaeus, the instigator of all this mischief, zealously continuedthe war, while at the same time he gave to the dreadedcommandant of Macedonia assurances of the full loyalty ofthe Achaean league. Thereupon the long-expected Romancommission made its appearance, with Aurelius Orestes atits head; hostilities were now suspended, and the Achaeandiet assembled at Corinth to receive its communications.

was to be appointed for pronouncing judgment in the caseof those jurymen, who had been or should be guilty ofaccepting bribes. By this means his immediate object wasgained; the capitalists were deprived of their political ex­clusive rights, and were rendered responsible for the per­petration of injustice. But the proposals and designs ofDrusus were by no means limited to this; his projects werenot measures adapted merely for the occasion, but a compre­hensive and thoroughly considered plan of reform. He pro­posed, moreover, to increase the largesses of grain and tocover the increased expense by the permanent issue of aproportional number of copper plated, alongside of thesilver, denarii; and then to set apart all the still undistributedarable land of Italy—thus including in particular the Cam-panian domains—and the best part of Sicily for the settle­ment of burgess-colonists. Lastly, he entered into the mostdistinct obligations towards the Italian allies to procure forthem the Roman franchise. Thus the very same supportsof power and the very same ideas of reform, on which theconstitution of Gaius Gracchus had rested, presented them­selves now on the side of the aristocracy—a singular, and yeteasily intelligible coincidence. It was only to be expectedthat, as the tyrannis had rested for its support against theoligarchy, so the latter should rest for its support againstthe moneyed aristocracy, on the paid and in some degreeorganized proletariate; while the government had formerlyaccepted the feeding of the proletariate at the expense ofthe state as an inevitable evil, Drusus now thought of em­ploying it, at least for the moment, against the moneyedaristocracy. It was only to be expected that the betterpart of the aristocracy, just as it formerly consented to theagrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus, would now readily con­sent to all those measures of reform, which, without touchingthe question of a supreme head, only aimed at the cure ofthe old evils of the state.

of the people withdrew from the commission its jurisdiction,and remitted the decision respecting what were domanialand what private possessions to the consuls, to whom, whereno special laws enacted otherwise, it constitutionally per­tained. This was simply a suspension of further domain-distribution under a mild form. The consul Tuditanus,by no means Gracchan in his views, and little inclined tooccupy himself with the difficult task of agrarian definition,embraced the opportunity of going off to the Ulyrian armyand leaving the duty intrusted to him unfulfilled. Theallotment-commission no doubt continued to subsist, but, asthe judicial regulation of the domain-land was at a stand­still, it was compelled to remain inactive. The reform-partywas deeply indignant. Even men like Publius Mucius andQuintus Metellus disapproved of Scipio's intervention.Assassina- Other circles were not content with expressing disap-t ion of proval. Scipio had announced for one of the following days.Emilianus. an addresg respecting the relations of the Latins; on themorning of that day he was found dead in his bed. He wasfifty-six years of age, and in full health and vigour; he hadspoken in public the day before, and then in the evening hadretired earlier than usual to his bedroom with a view toprepare the outline of his speech for the following day. Thathe became the victim of a political assassination, cannot bedoubted; he himself had shortly before mentioned in publicthe plots formed to murder him. What assassin's hand hadduring the night slain the first statesman and the first generalof his age was never discovered; and it does not become his­tory either to repeat the reports handed down from the con­temporary gossip of the city, or to set about the childishattempt to ascertain the truth out of such materials.

The tribunals did not interfere. Thepopular party, justly fearing that its leaders GaiuaGracchus, Flaccus, and Carbo, whether guilty or not, mightbe involved in the prosecution, opposed with all its mightthe institution of an inquiry; and the aristocracy, whichlost in Scipio quite as much an antagonist as an ally wasnot unwilling to let the matter sleep.

of allowable and non-allowable actions; whose grammarand jurisprudence, moreover, urgently required a methodicaltreatment, without possessing the ability to develop such atreatment of themselves. So this philosophy thoroughlyincorporated itself, as a plant borrowed no doubt fromabroad but acclimatized in Italian soil, with the Romannational economy, and we meet its traces in the mostdiversified spheres of action. Its earliest appearance beyonddoubt goes further back; but the Stoa was first raised tofull influence in the higher ranks of Roman society bymeans of the group which gathered round Scipio jEmilianus.Panaetius of Rhodes, the instructor of Scipio and of allScipio's intimate friends in the Stoical philosophy, who wasconstantly in his train and usually attended him even onjourneys, knew how to adapt the system to clever men ofthe world, to keep its speculative side in the background,and to mitigate in some measure the dryness of the ter­minology and the insipidity of its moral catechism, moreparticularly by the aid of the earlier philosophers, amongwhom Scipio himself had an especial predilection for theSocrates of Xenophon. Thenceforth the most noted states­men and scholars professed the Stoic philosophy—amongothers Stilo and Quintus Scaevola, the founders of scientificphilology and scientific jurisprudence. The scholasticformality of system, which thenceforth prevails at leastexternally in these professional sciences and is especiallyassociated with a fanciful, charade-like, insipid method ofetymologizing, descends from the Stoa. But infinitely moreimportant was the new state-philosophy and state-religion,which emanated from the blending of the Stoic philosophyand the Roman religion. The speculative element, fromthe first impressed with but little energy on the system ofZeno and still further weakened when that system foundadmission to Rome,—after the Greek schoolmasters hadalready for a century been busily driving this philosophyinto boys' heads and thereby driving the spirit out of it,—fell completely into the shade in Rome, where nobodyspeculated but the money-changers; little further was saidas to the ideal development of the God ruling in the soulof man, or of the divine law of the world. The Stoicalphilosophers showed themselves not insensible to the verylucrative distinction of seeing their system raised into thesemi-official Roman state-philosophy, and proved altogether

The administrationof justice was suspended over the whole island, and vio­lence was the only law. As no cultivator living in townventured any longer beyond the gates, and no countrymanventured into the towns, the most fearful famine set in, andthe town-population of this island which formerly fed Italyhad to be supported by the Roman authorities sendingsupplies of grain. Moreover, conspiracies of the town-slaveseverywhere threatened to break out within, while theinsurgent armies lay before, the walls; even Messana waswithin a hair's breadth of being conquered by Athenion.
Difficult as it was for the government during the seriouswar with the Cimbri to place a second army in the field,it could not avoid sending in 651 an army of 14,000 Ro- 103.mans and Italians, not including the transmarine militia,under the praetor Lucius Lucullus to the island. Theunited slave-army was stationed in the mountains aboveSciacca, and accepted the battle which Lucullus offered.Their better military organization gave,the Romans thevictory; Athenion was left for dead on the field, Tryphonhad to throw himself into the mountain-fortress of Triocala;the insurgents deliberated earnestly, whether it was possibleto continue the struggle longer. But the party, which wasresolved to hold out to the last man, retained the ascendancy;Athenion, who had been saved in a marvellous manner,reappeared among his troops and revived their sunkencourage; above all, Lucullus with incredible negligence tooknot the smallest step to follow up his victory; in fact, he issaid to have intentionally disorganized the army and to haveburned his field baggage, with a view to screen the totalwant of success in his government and not to be cast intothe shade by his successor. Whether this was true or not,his successor Gaius Servilius (652) obtained no better 102.results; aud both generals were afterwards criminallyindicted and condemned for their conduct in office—which,however, was no certain proof of their guilt.

this war had in fact revealed the utter nullity of the oppo­sition no less than it had divulged the corruption of thegovernment. It was not possible to govern worse than the117-109. restoration governed in the years 637-645; it was notpossible to be more defenceless and forlorn than was the109- senate in 645: had there been in Rome a real opposition,that is to say, a party which wished and urged a funda­mental alteration of the constitution, it must necessarilyhave now made at least an attempt to overturn the restoredsenate. No such attempt took place; the political questionwas converted into a personal one, the generals werechanged, and one or two useless and unimportant peoplewere banished. It was thus settled, that the so-called popu­lar party as such neither could nor would govern; that onlytwo forms of government were at all possible in Rome, atyrannis or an oligarchy; that, so long as there happenedto be nobody sufficiently well known, if not sufficiently im­portant, to usurp the regency of the state, the worst mis­management endangered at the most individual oligarchs,but never the oligarchy; that on the other hand, so soonas such a pretender appeared, nothing was easier than toshake the rotten curule chairs. In this respect the comingforward of Marius was significant, just because it was in itselfso utterly unwarranted. If the burgesses had stormed thesenate-house after the defeat of Albinus, it would havebeen natural, not to say proper; but after the turn whichMetellus had given to the Numidian war, nothing morecould be said of mismanagement, and still less of dangerto the commonwealth, at least in that respect: and yet thefirst ambitious officer who turned up succeeded in doingthat with which the older Africanus had once threatened thegovernment (ii. 358), and procured for himself one of theprincipal military commands against the distinctly expressedwill of the governing body. Public opinion, unavailing in thehands of the so-called popular party, became an irresistibleweapon in the hands of the future king of Rome. We donot mean to say that Marius intended to play the pretender,at least at the time when he canvassed the people for thesupreme command in Africa ; but, whether he did or did notunderstand what he was doing, there was evidently an endof the restored aristocratic government when tne < omitialmachine began to make generals, or, which was nearly thesame thing, when every popular officer was in a position to

than pious had announced that-the banishment of the consulCinna and of the six tribunes of the people adhering to himwould restore peace and tranquillity to the country; and, inconformity not with the constitution but with this counsel ofthe gods fortunately laid hold of by the custodiers of oracles,the consul Cinna was by decree of the senate deprived ofhis office, Lucius Cornelius Merula was chosen in his stead,and outlawry was pronounced against the chiefs who hadfled. It seemed as if the whole crisis were about to endin a few additions to the number of the men who wereexiles in Numidia.
Beyond doubt nothing further would have come of the move- The Cin-ment, had not the senate with its usual remissness omitted °™s into compel the fugitives to quit Italy as soon as possible, y"and had there not been a possibility that the latter might,as the champions of the emancipation of the new burgesses,renew in their own favour to some extent the revolt of theItalians. "Without obstruction they appeared in Tibur, inPraeneste, in all the important communities of new burgessesin Latium and Campania, and asked and obtained every­where money and men for the furtherance of the commoncause. Thus supported, they made their appearance amongthe army besieging Nola. The armies of this period weredemocratic and revolutionary in their views, wherever thegeneral did not attach them to himself by his personal in­fluence; the speeches of the fugitive magistrates, some ofwhom, especially Cinna and Sertorius, were favourablyremembered by the soldiers in connection with the lastcampaigns, made a deep impression; the unconstitutionaldeposition of the popular consul and the interference of thesenate with the rights of the sovereign people told on thecommon soldier, and the gold of the consul or rather of thenew burgesses made the breach of the constitution clear tothe officers. The Campanian army recognized Cinna asconsul and swore the oath of fidelity to him man by man;it became a nucleus for the bands that flocked in from thenew burgesses and even from the allied communities; aconsiderable army, though consisting mostly of recruits,soon moved from Campania towards the capital. Otherbands approached it from the north. On Cinna's invitationthose who had been banished in the previous year hadlanded at Telamon on the Etruscan coast.

Reinforced bythese men and the contingents of the new burgesses, as wellas by the exiles who flocked to him with their partisansfrom all sides, he soon numbered 6000 men under his eaglesand was able to man forty ships, which took their stationbefore the mouths of the Tiber and gave chase to the corn-ships sailing towards Rome. With these he placed himselfat the disposal of the "consul" Cinna. The leaders of theCampanian army hesitated; the more sagacious, Sertoriusin particular, seriously pointed out the danger of too closelyconnecting themselves with a man whose name would neces­sarily place him at the head of the movement, and who yetwas notoriously incapable of any statesmanlike action andhaunted by an insane thirst for revenge; but Cinna disre­garded these scruples, and confirmed Marius in the supremecommand in Etruria and at sea with proconsular powers.
Thus the storm gathered around the capital, and thegovernment could no longer delay bringing forward then-troops to protect it.* But the forces of Metellus weredetained by the Italians in Samnium and before Nola;Strabo alone was in a position to hasten to the help of thecapital. He appeared and pitched his camp at the Collinegate: with his numerous and experienced army he mightprobably have rapidly and totally annihilated the still weakband of insurgents; but this seemed to be no part of hisdesign. On the contrary he allowed Rome to be actuallynans around invested by the insurgents. Cinna with his corps and thatof Carbo took post on the right bank of the Tiber opposite tothe Janiculum, Sertorius on the left bank confronting Pom-peius over against the Servian wall.

character of Ostia, Puteoli, and Brundisium, where withforeign wares foreign manners also first found admissionand became thence more widely diffused.
The immediate result of this complete revolution in the Mixture ofrelations of nationality was certainly far from pleasing, peoples.Italy swarmed with Greeks, Syrians, Phoenicians, Jews,Egyptians, while the provinces swarmed with Romans;sharply defined national peculiarities everywhere came intomutual contact, and were visibly worn off; it seemed as ifnothing was to be left behind but the general impress ofutilitarianism. What the Latin character gained in extent,it lost in freshness; especially in Rome itself, where themiddle class disappeared the soonest and most entirely,and nothing was left but the grandees and the beggars,both in an equal measure cosmopolitan. Cicero assuresus that about 660 the general culture in the Latin towns 90.was higher than in Rome; and this is confirmed by the litera­ture of this period, whose pleasantest, healthiest, and mostcharacteristic products, such as the national comedy andthe Lucilian satire, were the native growth of Latium or ofthe Latin colonies. That the Italian Hellenism of thelower orders was in reality nothing but a repulsive cosmopoli­tanism tainted at once with all the extravagances of cultureand with a superficially whitewashed barbarism, is self-evi­dent; but even in the case of the better society the fine tasteof the Scipionic circle did not remain the permanent standard.The more the mass of society began to take interest inGreek life, the more decidedly it resorted not to the classi­cal literature, but to the most modern and frivolous produc­tions of the Greek mind; instead of moulding the Romancharacter in the Hellenic spirit, they contented themselveswith borrowing that sort of pastime which set their ownintellect to work as little as possible. In this sense theArpinate landlord Marcus Cicero, the father of the orator,said that among the Romans, just as among Syrian slaves,each was the less worth, the more he understood Greek.
This national decomposition is, like the whole age, far frompleasing, but also like that age significant and momentous.The circle of peoples, which we are accustomed to call theancient world, advances from an outward union under theauthority of Rome to an inward union under the sway ofthe modern culture resting essentially on Hellenic elements.Over the ruins of peoples of the second rank the great

designedly left the public uncertain whether it was receivingsilver or token money, and to what total amount the latterwas in circulation. In the embarrassed period of the civilwar and of the great financial crisis they seem to have sounduly availed themselves of plating, that a monetary crisisaccompanied the financial one, and the quantity of spuriousand partially worthless pieces rendered dealings extremelyinsecure. Accordingly during the Cinnan government an en­actment was passed by the praetors and tribunes, primarilyby Marcus Marius Gratidianus (P. 352), for redeeming allthe token-money by means of silver-money, and for thatpurpose an assay-office was established. How far the calling-in was effected, tradition has not told us; the coining oftoken-money itself continued to subsist.Provincial -^s to tne provinces, in accordance with the setting asidemoney. of gold money on principle the coining of gold was nowherepermitted, not even in the client-states; so that a goldcoinage at this period occurs only where Rome had nothingat all to say, namely among the Celts to the north of theCevennes and among the states in revolt against Rome;the Italians, for instance, and Mithradates Eupator struckgold coins. The government seems to have made efforts tobring the coinage of silver also more and more into its hands,Currency of particularly in the West. In Africa, where in consequencethe East. of the Carthaginian system of token-money there was atthe time of the Roman conquest no proper native money,none such was introduced by the Romans and certainly fromthe first the denarius alone was current. The same was pro­bably true of Sardinia. In Spain and Sicily, which cameearlier to the Romans and experienced altogether a mildertreatment, silver was no doubt coined under the Roman rule,and indeed in the latter country the silver coinage wasfirst called into existence by the Romans and based on theRoman standard (ii. 68, 207, 381); but there exist goodgrounds for the supposition, that in both countries at leastfrom the beginning of the seventh century the provincialand urban mints were under the necessity of restrictingtheir issues to copper small money. Only in NarboneseGaul the right of coining silver could not be withdrawnfrom the old-allied and considerable free city of M assilia;and the same was perhaps true of the Greek cities in Illyria,Apollouia and Dyrrachium.

beyond the pale of the law, and, secondly, he limited asfar as possible the number of victims and allowed at leastno offensive outbreak of fury against inferior persons. Asimilar moderation appears in the political arrangements.The innovation as respects legislation—the most importantand apparently the most comprehensive—in fact only broughtthe letter of the constitution into harmony with its spirit.The Roman legislation, under which any consul, praetor, ortribune could propose to the burgesses any measure atpleasure and bring it to the vote without debate, had fromthe first been irrational and had become daily more so withthe growing nullity of the comitia; it was only tolerated,because in practice the senate had claimed for itself theprivilege of previous deliberation and regularly crushed anyproposal put to the vote without such previous deliberationby means of the political or religious veto (i. 327). The revo­lution had swept away these barriers; in consequence ofwhich that absurd system now began fully to develop its con­sequences, and to put it in the power of any petulant knaveto overthrow the state in due form of law. What was undersuch circumstances more natural, more necessary, moretruly conservative, than now to recognize formally and ex­pressly the legislation of the senate to which effect had beenhitherto given by a circuitous process? The renewal of theelectoral census was in a somewhat similar position. Theearlier constitution was thoroughly based on it; and thereform of 513, while restricting the privileges of the men of 241.wealth, had rigorously retained the principle of excludingthe burgesses rated below 11,000 sesterces (£113) from anysort of influence on the elections.

Jugurtha since the victory over Albinus wasregarded as the deliverer of Libya from the rule of thehated foreigners; unscrupulous and cunning as he was, andunwieldy as was the Roman government, he might at anytime even after a peace rekindle the war in his nativecountry ; tranquillity would not be secured, and the removalof the African army would not be possible, until kingJugurtha should cease to exist. Officially Metellus gaveevasive answers to the proposals of the king; secretly heinstigated the envoys to deliver their master dead or aliveto the Romans. But, when the Roman general undertookto compete with the African in the field of assassination, hethere met his master; Jugurtha saw through the scheme,and, when he could not help himself, prepared for a despe­rate resistance.Battle on Beyond the utterly barren mountain-range, over whichthe Muthul. jay the route of the Romans into the interior, a wide plaineighteen miles broad extended as far as the river Muthul,which ran parallel to the mountain-chain. The plain wasdestitute of water and of trees except in the immediatevicinity of the river, and was only intersected by a ridge ofhills covered with low brushwood. On this ridge of hillsJugurtha awaited the Roman army. His troops werearranged in two masses; the one, including a part of theinfantry and the elephants, under Bomilcar at the pointwhere the ridge abutted on the river, the other, embracingthe flower of the infantry and all the cavalry, higher uptowards the mountain-chain, concealed by the bushes. Ondebouching from the mountains, the Romans saw the enemyin a position completely commanding their right flank; and,as they could not possibly remain on the bare and arid crestof the chain and were under the necessity of reaching theriver, they had to solve the difficult problem of gaining thestream through the entirely open plain of eighteen miles'breadth, under the eyes of the enemy's horsemen and withoutlight cavalry of their own.

But even in other lessillustrious circles similar relations occur; we may mentionanother contemporary of Scipio, the philosopher Clitomachus,because his life at the same time presents a vivid view ofthe great mingling of nations at this epoch. A nativeof Carthage, then a disciple of Carneades at Athens andafterwards his successor in his professorship, he held inter­course from Athens with the most cultivated men of Italy,the historian Aulus Albinus and the poet Lucilius, anddedicated on the one hand a scientific work to Lucius Ceu-sorinus the Roman consul who opened the siege of Car­thage, and on the other hand a philosophic consolatorytreatise to his fellow-citizens who were conveyed to Italyas slaves. While Greek literary men of note had hithertotaken up their abode temporarily in Rome as ambassadors,exiles, or otherwise, they now began to settle there; forinstance, the already mentioned Panaetius lived in Scipio'shouse, and the hexameter-maker Archias of Antioch settled102, at Rome in 652 and supported himself respectably by theart of improvising and by epic poems on Roman consulars.Even Gaius Marius, who hardly understood a line of hiscarmen and was altogether as ill adapted as possible for aMaecenas, could not avoid patronizing the artist in verse.While intellectual and literary life thus brought the nobler,if not the purer, elements of the two nations into connec­tion with each other, on the other hand the arrival of troopsof slaves from Asia Minor and Syria and the mercantileimmigration from the Greek and half-Greek East brought thecoarsest strata of Hellenism—largely alloyed with Orientaland generally barbaric ingredients—into contact with theItalian proletariate, and gave to that also a Hellenic colour­ing. The observation of Cicero, that new language and newfashions first make their appearance in maritime towns,probably had a primary reference to the semi-Hellenic

resistance which he encountered, propose it himself. Themeasure against the insolvency of senators was doubtlesscalled forth by the exposure of the economic condition of theruling families—so deeply embarrassed notwithstanding alltheir outward splendour—on occasion of the last financialcrisis. It was painful indeed, but yet in itself conducive tothe rightly understood interest of the aristocracy, that, aswas necessarily the effect of the Sulpician proposal, all per­sons should withdraw from the senate who were unablespeedily to meet their liabilities, and that the coterie-system,which found one of its main supports in the insolvency ofmany senators and their consequent dependence on theirwealthy colleagues, should be checked by the removal of thenotoriously venal portion of the senators. At the same time,of course, we do not mean to deny that such a purificationof the senate-house so abruptly and invidiously exposing thesenate, as Rufus proposed, would certainly never have beenproposed without his personal quarrels with the heads of theruling coteries. Lastly, the regulation in favour of the freed­men had undoubtedly the primary object of making its pro­poser master of the street; but in itself it was neitherunwarranted nor incompatible with the aristocratic consti­tution. Since the freedmen had begun to be drawn uponfor military service, their demand for the right of votingwas so far justified, as the right of voting and the obligationof service had always gone hand in hand. Moreover, lookingto the nullity of the comitia, it was politically of very littlemoment whether one sewer more emptied itself into thatslough. The difficulty which the oligarchy felt in govern­ing with the comitia was lessened rather than increased bythe unlimited admission of the freedmen, who were to avery great extent personally and financially dependent onthe ruling families and, if rightly used, might just furnishthe government with a means of controlling the electionsmore thoroughly than before. This measure certainly, likeevery other political favour shown to the proletariate,ran counter to the tendencies of the aristocracy friendly toreform; but it was for Rufus hardly anything else thanwhat the corn-law had been for Drusus—a means of draw­ing the proletariate over to his side and of breaking downwith its aid the opposition against the truly beneficial re­forms which he meditated.

He challenged competitionat table also—-he arranged banqueting matches and carriedoff in person the prizes proposed lor the most substantial eaterand the hardest drinker—and not less so in the pleasures ofthe harem, as was shown among other things by the licentiousletters of his Greek mistresses, which were found among hispapers. His intellectual wants he satisfied by the wildestsuperstition—the interpretation of dreams and the Greekmysteries occupied not a few of the king's hours—and by arude adoption of Hellenic civilization. He was fond ofGreek art and music; that is to say, he collected preciousarticles, rich furniture, old Persian and Greek objects ofluxury—his cabinet of rings was famous—he had constantlyGreek historians, philosophers, and poets in his train, and pro­posed prizes at his court-festivals not only for the greatesteaters and drinkers, but also for the merriest jester and thebest singer. Such was the man; the sultan corresponded.In the East, where the relation between the ruler and theruled bears the character of natural rather than of morallaw, the subject resembles the dog alike in fidelity and infalsehood, the ruler is cruel and distrustful. In both re­spects Mithradates has hardly been surpassed. By his ordersthere died or pined in perpetual captivity for real or allegedtreason his mother, his brother, his sister espoused to him,three of his sons and as many of his daughters. Still morerevolting perhaps is the fact, that among his secret paperswere found sentences of death, drawn up beforehand, againstseveral of his most confidential servants. In like manner itwas a genuine trait of the sultan, that he afterwards, for themere purpose of depriving his enemies of trophies of victory,caused his whole harem to be killed and distinguishedhis favourite concubine, a beautiful Ephesian, by allowingher to choose the mode of death.

did, it remaina nevertheless true that before the Parthianwars he was the only enemy who gave serious trouble to theRomans in the East, and that he defended himself againstthem as the lion of the desert defends himself against thehunter. But we are not entitled, in accordance with whatwe know, to recognize in him more than the resistance tobe expected from such a vigorous nature.
But whatever judgment we may form as to the individualcharacter of the king, his historical position remains in ahigh degree significant. The Mithradatic wars formed at oncethe last movement of the political opposition offered byHellas to Rome, and the beginning of a revolt against theRoman supremacy resting on very different and far deepergrounds of'antagonism—the national reaction of the Asiaticsagainst the Occidentals. The empire of Mithradates was,like himself, Oriental; polygamy and the system of the haremprevailed at court and generally among the nobles; the reli­gion of the inhabitants of the country as well as the officialreligion of the court was pre-eminently the old nationalworship; the Hellenism there was little different from theHellenism of the Armenian Tigranidae and the ArsacidaB ofthe Parthian empire. The Greeks of Asia Minor mightimagine for a brief moment that they had found in this kinga support for their political dreams; his battles were reallyfought for matters very different from those which weredecided on the fields of Magnesia and Pydna. They formed—after a long truce—a new passage in the huge duel betweenthe West and the East, which has been transmitted fromthe struggle of Marathon to the present generation andwill perhaps reckon its future by thousands of years as ithas reckoned its past.The nation- Manifest however as is the foreign and unHellenic cha­racter of the whole life and action of the Cappadocian kintr.it is difficult to define what national element preponderatedin it, nor will research perhaps ever succeed in gettingbeyond generalities or in attaining clear views on thispoint.

and Epicurus denied to them at least any influence on thefortunes of men. Between these systems and the Romanreligion no alliance was possible; they were proscribed andremained so. Even in Cicero's writings it is declared theduty of a citizen to resist Euhemerism as prejudicial to reli­gious worship; and of the Academics and Epicureans whoappear in his dialogues, the former has to plead the ex­cuse that, while as a philosopher he is a disciple of Carneades,as a citizen and pontifex he is an orthodox confessor of theCapitoline Jupiter, and the Epicurean has even ultimately tosurrender and be converted. No one of these three systemswas in any proper sense popular. The plain intelligible cha­racter of Euhemerism exerted doubtless a certain power ofattraction over the Romans, and in particular produced onlytoo deep an effect on the conventional history of Rome withits at once childish and senile resolution of fable into history;but it remained without material influence on the Roman re­ligion, because the latter from the first dealt only in allegoryand not in fable, and it was not possible in Rome as inHellas to write biographies of Zeus the first, second, andthird. The modern sophistry could only succeed whereclever volubility was indigenous, as in Athens, and where,moreover, the long series of philosophical systems thathad come and gone had accumulated huge piles of intel­lectual rubbish. Against the Epicurean quietism, in fine,everything revolted that was sound and honest in theRoman character thoroughly devoted as it was to action. Yetit found more partisans than Euhemerism and the sophisticschool, and this was probably the reason why the policecontinued to wage war against it longest and most seriously.But this Roman Epicureanism was not so much a philosophicsystem as a sort of philosophical mask, under which—verycontrary to the purpose of its strictly moral founder—thoughtless sensual enjoyment dressed itself out for goodsociety; one of the earliest adherents of this sect, for in­stance, Titus Albucius figures in the poems of Lucilius asthe prototype of the Roman Hellenizing amiss.Roman Far different were the position and influence of the Stoic

anything else before him than simple prose; in point ofeffect they can only be compared to our doggerel verses.*The poems of Terence and those of Lucilius stand on thesame level of culture, and have the same relation to eachother as a carefully prepared and polished literary work hasto a letter written on the spur of the moment. But the in­comparably higher intellectual gifts and the freer view oflife, which mark the knight of Suessa as compared with theAfrican slave, rendered his success as rapid and brilliant asthat of Terence had been laborious and doubtful; Luciliusbecame immediately the favourite of the nation, and helike Beranger could say of his poems that "they alone of allwere read by the people." The uncommon popularity ofthe Lucilian poems is, in a historical point of view, a remark­able event; we see from it that literature was already apower, and beyond doubt we should fall in with various tracesof its influence, if a thorough history of this period had beenpreserved. Posterity has only confirmed the judgment ofcontemporaries; the Roman judges of art who were opposedto the Alexandrian school assigned to Lucilius the first rankamong all the Latin poets. So far as satire can be regardedas a distinct form of art at all, Lucilius created it; and in itcreated the only species of art which was peculiar to theRomans and was transmitted by them to posterity.
Of poetry based on the Alexandrian school nothing occursin Bome at this epoch except minor poems translated fromor modelled on Alexandrian epigrams, which deserve noticenot on their own account, but as the first harbingers of the

But since that time the simplecivil and moral organization of a great agricultural city hadbeen succeeded by the social antagonisms of a capital of manynations, and by that demoralization in which the prince andthe beggar meet; now everything had come to be on abroader, more abrupt, and fearfully grander scale. Whenthe Social war brought all the political and social elementsfermenting among the citizens into collision with each other,it laid the foundation for a new revolution. An accidentled to its outbreak.
It was the tribune of the people Publius Sulpicius Rufus The Snipi-who in 666 proposed to the burgesses to declare that every cian 1:lws-senator, who owed more than 2000 denarii (£82), shouldforfeit his seat in the senate; to grant to the burgessescondemned by non-free jury courts liberty to return home;to distribute the new burgesses among all the tribes, andlikewise to allow the right of voting in all tribes to thefreedmen. They were proposals, which from the mouth ofsuch a man were at least somewhat surprising. Publius SulpiciusSulpicius Rufus (born in 630) owed his political importance Kut'ua.not so much to his noble birth, his important connections, m"and his hereditary wealth, as to his remarkable talent asan orator, in which none of his contemporaries equalledhim. His powerful voice, his lively gestures sometimesbordering on theatrical display, the luxuriant copiousnessof his flow of words arrested, even if they did not convince,his hearers.

The client states recognized as fullysovereign—such as the kingdoms of Numidia and Cappadocia,the allied states (civitates fcederatce) of Rhodes, Messana, Tau-romenium, Massilia, Gades—were legally exempt from tax­ation, and merely bound by their treaties to support the Ro­man republic in time of war by regularly furnishing a fixednumber of ships and men at their own expense, and, as amatter of course in case of need, by rendering extraordinaryTaxes. aid of any kind. The rest of the provincial territory on the
other hand, even including the free cities, was throughoutliable to taxation; the only exceptions were the cities investedwith the Roman franchise, such as Narbo, and the communi­ties on which immunity from taxation was specially conferred(civitates immunes), such as Centuripa in Sicily. The directtaxes consisted partly—as in Sicily and Sardinia—of a title tothe tenth * of the sheaves and other field produce as of grapesand olives, or, if the land lay in pasture, to a correspondingscriptura; partly—as in Macedonia, Achaia, Cyrene, thegreater part of Africa, the two Spains, and by Sulla's ar­rangements also in Asia—of a fixed sum of money to be paidannually by each community to Rome (stipendium, tributtirri).This amounted, e.g. for all Macedonia to 600,000 denarii(£24,000), for the small island of Gyaros near Andros to150 denarii (£6 4s.), and was apparently on the whole lowand less than the tax paid before the Roman rule. Thoseground-tenths and pasture-moneys the state farmed out toprivate contractors on condition of their paying fixed quan­tities of grain or fixed sums of money; with respect to thelatter money-payments the state drew upon the respective*. communities, and left it to these to assess the amount,according to the general principles laid down by the Romangovernment, on the persons liable, and to collect it fromthem.f The indirect taxes consisted—apart from the

Such were the political speeches of G-aiusLaelius and of Scipio iEmilianus, masterpieces of excellentLatin as of the noblest patriotism; such were the fluentspeeches of Gaius Titius, from whose pungent pictures of theplace and the time—his description of the senatorial judexhas been given already (P. 419)—the national comedyborrowed various points; such above all were the nume­rous orations of Gains Gracchus, whose fiery words pre­served in a faithful mirror the impassioned earnestness,the noble bearing, and the tragic destiny of that highlygifted nature.
In scientific literature the collection of juristic opinions Sciences.by Marcus Brutus, which was published about the year 600, 15o.presents a remarkable attempt to transplant the Greekmethod of handling professional subjects by means of dia­logue to Rome, and to give to his treatise an artistic semi-dramatic form by a machinery of conversation in which thepersons, time, and place, were distinctly specified. But thelater men of science, such as Stilo the philologist and Sctevolathe jurist, laid aside this method, more poetical than practi­cal, both in the sciences of general culture and in the specialprofessional sciences. The increasing value of science assuch, and the preponderance of the practical interest in it atRome, are clearly reflected in this rapid rejection of thefetters of artistic form.

The114. scandalous affair of 640 seq. is well known, in which threeVestals, daughters of the noblest families, and their para­mours, young men likewise of the best houses, were broughtto trial for unchastity first before the pontifical college,and then, when it sought to hush up the matter, before anextraordinary court instituted by special decree of thepeople, and were all condemned to death. Such scandals, itis true, sedate people could not approve; but there was noobjection to men discussing the folly of positive religion intheir familiar circle; the augurs might, when one saw anotherperforming his functions, smile in each other's face withoutdetriment to their religious duties. We learn to lookfavourably on the modest hypocrisy of kindred tendencies,when we compare with it the coarse shamelessness of theRoman priests and Levites. The official religion was quitecandidly treated as a hollow framework now serviceable onlyfor political machinists; in this respect with its nume­rous recesses and trap-doors it might and did serve eitherparty, as it happened. Most of all certainly the oligarchyrecognized its palladium in the state religion, and particu­larly in the augural discipline; but the opposite partyalso made no resistance in point of principle to an institutewhich had now merely a semblance of life; they regarded it,on the contrary, as a bulwark which might pass from thepossession of the enemy into their own.Oriental In sharp contrast to this ghost of religion which we

aristocracy were in fact perfectly compatible with their ownadvantage, and nothing further was sacrificed by such apolicy than merely the public weal.
All those measures which were devised by Gaius Gracchus The domainfor the promotion of the public welfare—the best but, as questionmay readily be conceived, also the most unpopular part of un^er *chis legislation—were allowed by the aristocracy to drop.Nothing was so speedily and so successfully assailed as thenoblest of his projects, viz., the scheme of introducing a legalequality first between the Roman burgesses and Italy, andthereafter between Italy and the provinces, and—inasmuchas the distinction between the merely ruling and consumingand the merely serving and working members of the statewas thus done away—at the same time solving the socialquestion by the most comprehensive and systematic emigra­tion known in history. With all the determination and all thepeevish obstinacy of dotage the restored oligarchy obtrudedthe principle of deceased generations—that Italy ought toremain the ruling land and Rome the ruling city in Italy—afresh on the present. Even in the lifetime of Gracchusthe claims of the Italian allies had been rejected, and thegreat idea of transmarine colonization had been subjected toa very serious attack, which became the immediate cause ofGracchus' fall. After his death the scheme of restoringCarthage was set aside with little difficulty by the govern­ment-party, although the several allotments already dis­tributed there were left to the recipients. It is true thatthey could not prevent a similar settlement of the democraticparty from succeeding at another point: in the course of theconquests beyond the Alps which Marcus Flaccus had begun,the colony of Narbo (Narbonne) was founded there in 63.6, lis.the oldest transmarine burgess-city in the Roman empire,which, in spite of manifold opposition from the government-party and in spite of a proposal directly made by the senateto abolish it, permanently held its ground. But, apart fromthis—in its isolation not very important—exception, thegovernment was uniformly successful in preventing theassignation of land out of Italy.
The Italian domain-question was settled in a similarspirit. The Italian colonies of Gaius, especially Capua,were cancelled, and such of them as had already been plantedwere again broken up; that of Tarentum alone was allowedto subsist in the form of the new town of Neptunia placed

Neverthe­less in a military point of view the change of commander-in-chief was a gain; Fimbria was not, like Flaccus, an inca­pable general, but energetic and talented. At Miietopolis (on Fimbria'sthe Rhyndacus to the west of Brussa) he defeated the younger victory atMithradates, who as governor of the satrapy of Pontus had MiletoPolls.marched against him, completely in a nocturnal assault, andby this victory opened his way to Pergamus, the capital for­merly of the Roman province and now of the Pontic king,whence he dislodged the king and compelled him to takeflight to the port of Pitane not far off, with the view ofthere embarking. Just at that moment Lucullus appearedin those waters with his fleet; Fimbria adjured him torender assistance so that he might be enabled to capture theking.

The statesman builds onlyso much as in the sphere assigned to him he can build.What a man of conservative views could do to save the oldconstitution, Sulla did; and he himself had a forebodingthat, while he might probably erect a fortress, he would beunable to create a garrison, and that the utter worthlessnessof the oligarchs would render any attempt to save theoligarchy vain. His constitution resembled a temporary dikethrown into the raging breakers; it was no reproach to thebuilder, if some ten years afterwards the waves swallowedup a structure reared iu defiance of nature and not defendedeven by those whom it sheltered. The statesman has noneed to be referred to highly commendable isolated reforms,such as those of the Asiatic revenue-system and of criminaljustice, that he may not summarily dismiss Sulla's ephe­meral restoration; he will admire it as a reorganizationof the Eoman commonwealth judiciously planned and onthe whole consistently carried out under infinite difficulties,and he will place the deliverer of Rome and the accom-plisher of Italian unity below, but yet in the same class with,Cromwell.

It was natural that the Catonian opposi­tion should once more bestir itself against these offensive^2. and pernicious conflicts of words. The censors of 662issued a warning to teachers and parents not to allow theyoung men to spend the whole day in exercises, whereoftheir ancestors had known nothing; and the man, fromwhom this warning came, was no less than the first forensicorator of his age, Lucius Licinius Crassus. Of course .theCassandra spoke in vain; declamatory exercises in Latin onthe current themes of the Greek schools became a permanentingredient in the education of Roman youth, and contributedtheir part to educate the very boys as forensic and politicalplayers and to stifle in the bud all earnest and trueeloquence.
As the aggregate result of this modern Roman educationthere sprung up the new idea of "humanity," as it wascalled, which consisted partly of a more or less superficialappropriation of the aesthetic culture of the Hellenes, partlyof a privileged Latin culture as an imitation or mutilatedcopy of the Greek. This new humanity, as the very nameindicates, renounced the specific peculiarities of Roman life,nay even came forward in opposition to them, and com­bined in itself, just like our closely kindred "generalculture," a nationally cosmopolitan and socially exclusivecharacter.

The party of thearistocracy friendly towards reform, which openly favouredthe distribution of the domains—headed by Quint us Metel-lus, just about this time (623) censor, and Publius Scaevola 131.—in concert with the party of Scipio -iEmilianus, which wasat least not disinclined to reform, gained the upper handfor the time being even in the senate; and a decree ofthe senate expressly directed the triumvirs to begin theirlabours.

If in this instance he appeared lenient, he showed on theother hand in the case of Ofella that he was not disposedto allow his marshals to take advantage of him; as soon asthe latter had appeared unconstitutionally as candidate,Sulla had him cut down in the public market-place, andthen explained to the assembled citizens that the deed wasdone by his orders and the reason for doing it. So this signi­ficant opposition of the staff to the new order of things wasno doubt silenced for the present; but it continued to subsistand furnished the practical commentary on Sulla's saying, thatwhat he did on this occasion could not be done a second time.
One thing still remained—perhaps the most difficult of Restorationall: to bring the exceptional state of things into accord- ofconstitu-ance with the paths prescribed by the new or old laws. It tionRlorde>-was facilitated by the circumstance, that Sulla never lostsight of this as his ultimate aim. Although the Valerianlaw gave him absolute power and gave to each of his ordi­nances the force of law, he had nevertheless availed himselfof this extraordinary prerogative only in the case of measureswhich were of transient importance and to take part inwhich would simply have uselessly compromised the senateand burgesses, especially in the case of' the proscriptions.Ordinarily he had himself observed those regulations whichhe prescribed for the future. That the people was con­sulted, we read in the law as to the quaestors which is stillin part extant; and the same is attested of other laws, e.g.the sumptuary law and those regarding the confiscations ofdomains. In like manner the senate was previously con­sulted in the more important administrative acts, such asin the sending forth and recall of the African army and inthe conferring of the charters of towns.

The new com­mander displayed his energy in the first instance by givingorders that all the Roman prisoners should be brought tothe battlements and, after undergoing cruel tortures, shouldbe thrown over before the eyes of the besieging army; and,when voices were raised in disapproval of the act, a reign ofterror was introduced with reference to the citizens also.Scipio meanwhile, after having confined the besieged to the cityitself, sought totally to cut off their intercourse with theouter world. He took up his head-quarters on the ridge bywhich the Carthaginian peninsula was connected with themainland, and, notwithstanding the various attempts of theCarthaginians to disturb his operations, constructed a greatcamp across the whole breadth of the isthmus, which com­pletely shut off the city from the landward side. Neverthelessships with provisions still ran into the harbour, partly boldmerchantmen allured by the great gain, partly vessels ofBithyas, who availed himself of every favourable wind toconvey supplies to the city from Nepheris at the end of thelake of Tunes; whatever might now be the sufferings ofthe citizens, the garrison was still sufficiently provided for.Scipio therefore constructed a stone mole, 96 feet broad,running" from the tongue of land between the lake and gulfinto the latter, so as thus to close the mouth of the harbour.The city seemed lost, when the success of this undertaking,which was at first ridiculed by the Carthaginians as imprac­ticable, became evident. But one surprise was balancedby another. While the Roman labourers were constructingthe mole, work was going forward night and day for two monthsin the Carthaginian harbour, without even the desertersbeing able to tell what were the designs of the besieged.All of a sudden, just as the Romans had completed thebar across the entrance to the harbour, fifty Carthaginiantriremes and a number of boats and skiffs sailed forthfrom that same harbour into the gulf; while the enemywere stopping up the old mouth of the harbour towards thesouth, the Carthaginians had by means of a canal formed inan easterly direction procured for themselves a new outlet,which owing to the depth of the sea at that spot could notpossibly be closed. Had the Carthaginians, instead ofresting content with a mere demonstration, thrown them­selves at once and resolutely on the half-dismantled andwholly unprepared Roman fleet, it must have been lost;

Unfortunately, in this respectthere was nothing done at all. In the first social crisis thelandholder had been enjoined by law to employ a number offree labourers proportioned to the number of his slavelabourers (i. 304). Now at the suggestion of the govern­ment a Punic treatise on agriculture (ii. 19), doubtlessgiving instructions in the system of planting after theCarthaginian mode, was translated into Latin for the useand benefit of Italian speculators—the first and onlyinstance of a literary undertaking suggested by the Romansenate! The same tendency showed itself in a more im­portant matter, or to speak more correctly in the vital ques­tion for Rome—the system of colonization. It needed nospecial wisdom but merely a recollection of the cause ofthe first social crisis in Rome, to perceive that the only realremedy against an agricultural proletariate consisted in acomprehensive and regular system of emigration (i. 312);for which the external relations of Romo offered the mostfavourable opportunity. Until nearly the close of the sixth V.

In the spring of 669 there was again fresh work inEurope. Mithradates, who continued his preparationsindefatigably in Asia Minor, had sent an army not muchless than that which had been extirpated at Chaeronea,under Dorylaws to Euboea; thence it had, after a junctionwith the remains of the army of Archelaus, passed over theEuripus to Boeotia. The Pontic king, who judged of whathis army could do by the standard of victories over theBithynian and Cappadocian militia, did not understand theunfavourable turn which things had taken in Europe; thecircles of the courtiers were already whispering as tothe treason of Archelaus; perempfouy orders were issuedto fight a second battle at once with the new army, and notto fail on this occasion in annihilating the Romans. Themaster's will was carried out, if not in conquering, at leastin fighting. The Romans and Asiatics met once more inthe plain of the Cephissus, near Orchomenus. The numerousand excellent cavalry of the latter flung itself impetuouslyon the Boman infantry, which began to waver and giveway: the danger was so urgent, that Sulla seized a standardand advancing with his adjutants and orderlies against theenemy called out with a loud voice to the soldiers that, ifthey should be asked at home where they had abandonedtheir general, they might reply—at Orchomenus. This hadits effect; the legions rallied and vanquished the euemv'shorse, after which the infantry were overthrown with littledifficulty.

Corinth, the first commercial city in Greece, remains a darkstain on the annals of Rome. By express orders from thesenate the Corinthian citizens were seized, and such aswere not killed were sold into slavery; the city itself wasnot only deprived of its walls and its citadel—a measurewhich, if the Romans were not disposed permanently togarrison it, was certainly inevitable—but was levelled withthe ground, and all rebuilding on the desolate site was pro­hibited in the usual forms of accursing; part of its territorywas given to Sicyon under the obligation that the lattershould defray the expense of the Isthmian national festivalin room of Corinth, but the greater portion was declaredto be public land of Rome. Thus was extinguished "theeye of Hellas," the last precious ornament of the Grecian landonce so rich in cities. If, however, we review the wholecatastrophe, the impartial historian must acknowledge—what the Greeks of this period themselves candidly con­fessed—that the Romans were not to blame for the waritself, but that on the contrary the foolish perfidy and thefeeble temerity of the Greeks compelled the Roman inter­vention. The abolition of the mock sovereignty of theleagues and of all the vague and pernicious dreams con­nected with them was a blessing for the country; and thegovernment of the Roman commander-in-chief of Macedonia,however much it fell short of what was to be wished, wasyet far better than the previous confusion and misrule otGreek confederacies and Roman commissions. The Pelopon­nesus ceased to be the great harbour of mercenaries; it isaffirmed, and may readily be believed, that with the directgovernment of Rome security and prosperity in some mea­sure returned throughout the land. The epigram of Themi-stocles, that ruin had averted ruin, was applied by the Greeksof that day not altogether without reason to the loss of Greekindependence. The singular indulgence, which Rome evennow showed towards the Greeks, is brought fully to lightonly by comparison with the contemporary conduct of thesame authorities towards the Spaniards and Phoenicians. Totreat barbarians with cruelty seemed not unallowable, butthe Romans of this period, like the Emperor Trajan in latertimes, deemed it "harsh and barbarous to deprive Athensand Sparta of the shadow of freedom which they stillretained."

Chersonese by his troops had become the signal for theAsiatic war (ii. 260), and could not but see that the occupationof the Tauric Chersonese by the Pontic king ought still lessto be tolerated now. The scale was at last turned by the Interven-practical reunion of the kingdom of Cappadocia, respecting t>on of thewhich, moreover, Nicomedes of Bithynia—who on his partsenate-had hoped to gain possession of Cappadocia by anotherPseudo-Ariarathes, and now saw that the Pontic pretenderexcluded his own—would not fail to urge the Romangovernment to intervention. The senate resolved thatMithradates should reinstate the Scythian princes—so farwere they driven out of the track of right policy by theirnegligent style of government, that instead of supporting theHellenes against the barbarians they had now on the contraryto support the Scythians against those who were half theircountrymen. Paphlagonia was declared independent, andthe Pseudo-Pylaemenes of Nicomedes as well as Mithradateswere directed to evacuate the portions of the country whichthey had occupied. In like manner the Pseudo-Ariaratheswas to retire from Cappadocia, and, as the representatives ofthe country refused the freedom proffered to it, a king wasonce more to be appointed by free popular election. Thedecrees sounded energetic enough; only it was an error, that Sulla sentiustead of sending an army they directed the governor ofto Cappado-Cilicia, Lucius Sulla, with the handful of troops whom he cli1,commanded there against the pirates and robbers, to inter­fere in Cappadocia. Fortunately the remembrance of theformer energy of the Romans defended their interests in theEast hetter than the existing government did, and the energyand versatility of the governor supplied what the senate leftto be desired in both respects. Mithradates kept back andcontented himself with inducing Tigranes the great king ofArmenia, who held a freer position with reference to theKomans than he did, to send troops to Cappadocia. Sullaquickly collected his forces and the contingents of the Asiaticallies, crossed the Taurus, and drove the governor Gordiusalong with his Armenian auxiliaries out of Cappadocia. Thisproved effectual. Mithradates yielded on all points; Gor­dius had to assume the blame of the Cappadocian troubles,and the Pseudo-Ariarathes disappeared; the election of king,which the Pontic faction had vainly attempted to directtowards Gordius, fell on the estimable Cappadocian Ario-barzanes.

In financial matters even under the former constitution Regulationthe decisive voice lay with the senate; the only point to be oftnedealt with, accordingly, was the re-establishment of an or- finanoes-derly administration. Sulla had found himself at first in nosmall pecuniary diificulty; the sums brought with him fromAsia Minor were soon expended for the pay of his nume­rous and constantly swelling army. Even after the victoryat the Colline gate the senate, seeing that the state-chesthad been carried off to Praneste, had been obliged to re­sort to urgent measures. Various building-sites in thecapital and several portions of the Campanian domains wereexposed to sale, the client kings, the freed and allied com­munities, were laid under extraordinary contribution, theirlanded property and their customs-revenues were in somecases confiscated, and in others new privileges were grantedto them for money. But the residue of nearly £600,000found in the public chest on the surrender of Praeneste, thepublic auctions which soon began, and other extraordinaryresources relieved the embarrassment of the moment. Pro­vision was made for the future not so much by the reformin the Asiatic revenues, under which the tax-payers were theprincipal gainers and the state chest was perhaps at most noloser, as by the resumption of the Campanian domains towhich iEnaria was now added (P. 356), and above all by theabolition of the largesses of grain, which since the time ofGaius Gracchus had eaten like a canker into the liomaufinances.

On the other hand it is con­ceivable enough that such a horde, after having wanderedperhaps for many years and having doubtless welcomed everybrother-in-arms who joined it in its movements near to orwithin the land of the Celts, would include a certain amountof Celtic elements; so that it is not surprising that menof Celtic name should be at the head of the Cimbri, or thatthe Romans should employ spies speaking the Celtic tongueto gain information among them. It was a marvellousmovement, the like of which the Romans had never seen;not a predatory expedition of mounted warriors, nor a " versacrum " of young men emigrating to a foreign land, but amigratory people that had set out with their women andchildren, with their goods and chattels, to seek a new home.The waggon, which had everywhere among the still notfully settled peoples of the north a difFerent importancefrom what it had among the Hellenes and the Italians, andwhich universally accompanied the Celts also in their en­campments, was among the Cimbrians as it were their house,where, beneath the leather covering stretched over it, a placewas found for the wife and children and even for the house­dog as well as for the furniture. The men of the south be­held with astonishment those tall lank figures with the fairlocks and bright-blue eyes, the hardy and stately womenwho were little inferior in size and strength to the men, andthe children with old men's hair, as the amazed Italianscalled the flaxen-haired youths of the north. Their systemof warfare was substantially that of the Celts of this period,who no longer fought, as the Italian Celts had formerly done,bareheaded and with merely sword and dagger, but withcopper helmets often richly adorned and with a peculiarmissile weapon, the materis; the large sword was retainedand the long narrow shield, along with which they probablywore uilso a coat of mail.

senatorial privileges (ii. 317, 326) to the equestrian orderwhich he brought into prominence was quite in the style ofGracchus, so it was in very truth his aim to impress on theequites the stamp of an order, similarly close and privileged,intermediate between the senatorial aristocracy and thecommon multitude; and this same aim was more promotedby those class-insignia, trifling though they were in them­selves and though many of equestrian rank might notavail themselves of them, than by many an ordinance farmore intrinsically important. But the party of materialinterests, though it by no means despised such honours, wasyet not to be gained through these alone. Gracchus perceivedwell, that it would no doubt fall duly to the highest bidder,but that it needed a great and substantial bidding; and sohe offered it the revenues of Asia and the jury courts.
The system of Roman financial administration, under Taxation ofwhich the indirect taxes as well as the domain-revenues were Asia,levied by means of middlemen, already granted to theRoman capitalist-class the most extensive advantages at theexpense of those liable to taxation. But the direct taxesconsisted either, as in most provinces, of fixed sums ofmoney payable by the communities—which of itself excludedthe intervention of Roman capitalists—or, as in Sicily andSardinia, of a ground-tenth, the levying of which for eachparticular community was leased in the provinces themselves,so that wealthy provincials regularly, and the tributarycommunities themselves very frequently, farmed the tenth oftheir districts and thereby kept at a distance the dangerousRoman middlemen. Six years ago, when the province ofAsia had fallen to the Romans, the senate had organizedit substantially according to the first system (P. 56).Gaius Gracchus* overturned this arrangement by a decreeof the people, and not only burdened the province, which hadhitherto been almost free from taxation, with the mostextensive indirect and direct taxes, particularly the ground-tenth, but also enacted that these taxes should be exposedto auction for the province as a whole and in Rome—a rulewhich practically excluded the provincials from participa­tion, and called into existence in the body of middlemen forthe decumcB, scriptura, and vectigalia of the province of Asia au

Manilius accomplished still lessagainst the impregnable wall of the citadel. The siege thuslingered on. The diseases engendered in the camp by theheat of summer, the departure of Censorinus the ablergeneral, the ill-humour and inaction of Massinissa who wasnaturally far from pleased to see the Romans taking forthemselves the booty which he had long coveted, and thedeath of the king at the age of ninety which ensued soonafter (end of 605), utterly arrested the offensive operations 149.of the Romans. They had enough to do in protecting theirships against the Carthaginian incendiaries and their campagainst nocturnal surprises, and in securing food for their menand horses by the construction of a harbour-fort and byforays in the neighbourhood. Two expeditions directedagainst Hasdrubal remained without success; and in factthe first, badly led over difficult ground, had almost termi­nated in a formal defeat. But, while the course of the warwas inglorious for the general and the army, the militarytribune Scipio achieved in it brilliant distinction. It washe who, on occasion of a nocturnal attack by the enemy onthe Roman camp, starting with some squadrons of horse andtaking the enemy in rear, compelled him to retreat.

The cities and islands sentmessengers to meet him, wherever he went, and to invite"the delivering god" to visit them; and in festal attire thecitizens flocked forth in front of their gates to receive him.Several places delivered the Roman officers sojourningamong them in chains to the king; Laodiceathus surrenderedQuintus Oppius, the commandant of the town, and Mytilenein Lesbos the consular Manius Aquillius.* The wholefury of the barbarian, who gets the man before whom he hastrembled into his power, discharged itself on the unhappyauthor of the war. The aged man was led throughout Asia1 Minor, sometimes on foot chained to a powerful mountedBastarnian, sometimes bound on an ass and proclaiming hisown name; and, when at length the pitiful spectacle againarrived at the royal quarters in Pergamus, by the king'sorders molten gold was poured down his throat—in orderto satiate his avarice, which had really occasioned the war—till he expired in torture.Orders But the king was not content with this savage mockery,

If any one had a vocation to the chief command in the
Asiatic war, it was Sulla. He had a few years before com­manded with the greatest success in the same theatre ofwar; he had contributed more than any other man to thesubjugation of the dangerous Italian insurrection; as consulof the year in which the Asiatic war broke out, he had beeninvested with the command in it after the customary wayand with the full consent of bis colleague, who was onfriendly terms with him and related to him by marriage. Itwas expecting a great deal to suppose that he would, inaccordance with a decree of the sovereign burgesses ofRome, give up a command undertaken in such circum­stances to an old military and political antagonist, in whosehands the army might be turned to none could tell whatviolent and preposterous proceedings. Sulla was neithergood-natured enough to comply voluntarily with such anorder, nor dependent enough to be compelled to do so. Hisarmy was—partly in consequence of the alterations of themilitary system which originated with Marius, partly fromthe moral laxity and the military strictness of its disciplinein the hands of Sulla—little more than a body of merce­naries absolutely devoted to their leader and indifferent topolitical affairs. Sulla himself was a hardened, cool, andclear-headed man, in whose eyes the sovereign Romanburgesses were a rabble, the hero of Aquae Sextiae a bank­rupt swindler, formal legality a mere phrase, Rome itselfa city without a garrison and with its walls half in ruins,which could be far more easily captured than Nola.Sulla's On these views he acted. He assembled his soldiers—

getting to hint that the new commander-in-chief would un­doubtedly lead to Asia Minor not the army as it stood, butanother formed of fresh troops.

Next141. year (613) Servilianus resumed the offensive, traversed thedistricts on the Baetis and Anas, and then advancing intoLusitania occupied a great many towns. A large num­ber of the insurgents fell into his hands; the leaders—ofwhom there were about 500—were executed; those whohad gone over from Roman ground to the enemy had theirhands cut off; the remaining multitude were sold intoslavery. But on this occasion also the Spanish war provedtrue to its fickle and capricious character. After all thesesuccesses the Roman army was attacked by Viriathus whileit was besieging Erisane, defeated, and driven to a rockwhere it was wholly in the power of the enemy. Viriathus,however, contented himself, like the Samnite general for­merly at the Caudine pass, with concluding a peace withServilianus, in which the community of the Lusitanians wasrecognized as sovereign and Viriathus acknowledged as itsking. The power of the Romans had not increased morethan the national sense of honour had declined; in the capi­tal men were glad to be rid of the irksome war, and thesenate and people ratified the treaty. But Quintus Servi-lius Caepio, the full brother of Servilianus and his successorin office, was far from satisfied with this complaisance; andthe senate was weak enough first to authorize the consulto undertake secret machinations against Viriathus, andthen to view with indulgence at least the. open breach, with­out any palliation, of his pledged word. So Caepio invadedLusitania, and traversed the land as far as the territories ofthe Vettones and Gallaeci; Viriathus declined a conflictwith the superior force, and by dexterous movements evaded140. 139. his antagonist (614). But when in the ensuing year (615)Caepio renewed the attack, and was supported by the army,which had in the mean time become available from the north­ern province, making its appearance under Marcus Popilliusin Lusitania, Viriathus sued for peace on any terms. He wasrequired to give up to the Romans all who had passed overto him from the Roman territory, amongst whom was hisown father-in-law; he did so, and the Romans ordered themto be executed or to have their hands cut off.

consequence of the faithlessness and perfidy which prevailedthe new burgesses had every reason, if not to suspect hispersonal designs, to doubt at any rate whether he wouldbe able to induce the majority of the senate to keep their"word after the victory.
In the spring of 671 Sulla landed with his legions in the Sulla [83.port of Brundisium. The senate, on receiving the news, de-lands inclared the commonwealth in danger, and committed to the Italy'consuls unlimited powers; but these incapable leaders hadnot been on their guard, and were surprised by a landingwhich had nevertheless been foreseen for years. The armywas still at Ariminum, the ports were not garrisoned, and—what is almost incredible—there was not a man under armsat all along the whole south-eastern coast. The consequenceswere soon apparent. Brundisium itself, a considerable and is rein-community of new burgesses, at once opened its gates forcl;ci °ywithout resistance to the oligarchic general, and all Messapia P"ljtlfansand Apulia followed its example. The army marched ers. eserthrough these regions as through a friendly country, andmindful of its oath uniformly maintained the strictest dis­cipline. Prom all sides the scattered remnant of the Opti-mate party flocked to the camp of Sulla. Quintus Metelluscame from the mountain ravines of Liguria, whither he hadmade his escape from Africa, and resumed, as colleague ofSulla, the proconsular command committed to him in 667 87.(P. 271), and withdrawn from him by the revolution. MarcusCrassus in like manner appeared from Africa with a smallband of armed men. Most of the Optimates, indeed, cameas noble emigrants with great pretensions and small desirefor fighting, so that they had to listen to bitter languagefrom Sulla himself regarding noble lords who wished tohave themselves preserved for the good of the state and couldnot be brought even so far as to arm their slaves. It wasof more importance, that deserters already made theirappearance from the democratic camp—for instance, therefined and respected Lucius Philippus, who was, alongwith one or two notoriously incapable persons, the onlyconsular that had come to terms with the revolutionarygovernment and accepted offices under it. He met withthe most gracious reception from Sulla, and obtained thehonourable and easy charge of occupying for him the pro­vince of Sardinia.

liation between Home and the provinces as the restoration ofmonarchy could not but bring in its train; the attempt torebuild Carthage destroyed by Italian rivalry and generallyto open the way for Italian emigration towards the pro­vinces, formed the first link in the long chain of that mo­mentous and beneficial course of action. Eight and wrong,fortune and misfortune were so inextricably blended in thissingular man and in this marvellous political constellation,that it may well beseem history in this case—though itbeseems her but seldom—to reserve her judgment.
When Gracchus had substantially completed the new The quw-constitution projected by him for the state, he applied him- tion as toself to a second and difficult work. The question as to the the allic8,Italian allies was still undecided. What were the viewsof the democratic leaders regarding it, had been renderedsufficiently apparent (P. 106). They naturally desired theutmost possible extension of the Roman franchise, not onlyin order to render the domains occupied by the Latins liableto distribution, but above all in order to reinforce theirfollowing by the enormous mass of the new burgesses, tobring the comitial machine still more fully under their powerby widening the body of privileged electors, and generally toabolish a distinction which had now with the fall of the re­publican constitution lost all serious importance. But herethey encountered resistance from their own party, and espe­cially from that band which otherwise readily gave its sove­reign affirmative to all which it did or did not understand.For the simple reason, that Roman citizenship seemed tothese people, so to speak, like a partnership which gave thema claim to share in sundry very tangible, direct and indi­rect, profits, they were not at all disposed to enlarge thenumber of the partners. The rejection of the Fulvian lawin 629, and the insurrection of the Fregellans arising out of it, 125.were significant indications both of the obstinate persever­ance of the fraction of the burgesses that swayed the comitia,and of the urgent impatience of the allies. Towards the endof his second tribunate (632) Gracchus, probably urged by 122,obligations which he had undertaken towards the allies,ventured on a second attempt. In concert with MarcusFlaccus—who, although a consular, had again taken the tri-buneship of the people, in order now to carry the law whichhe had formerly proposed without success—he made aproposal to grant to the Latins the full franchise, and to

The Samnite general Lucius Clueutius came up tobring relief to the town, but he was repulsed by Sulla; andwhen, reinforced by bands of Celts, he renewed his attempt,he was, chiefly owing to the wavering of these untrust­worthy associates, so totally defeated that his camp wastaken and he himself was cut down with the greater part ofhis troops in their flight towards Nola. The grateful Romanarmy conferred on its general the grass-wreath—the homelybadge with which the usage of the camp decorated thesoldier who had by his energy saved a division of his com­rades. Without pausing to undertake the siege of Nolaand of the other Campanian towns still occupied by theSamnites, Sulla at once advanced into the interior, whichwas the head-quarters of the insurrection. The speedy cap­ture and fearful punishment of JEclanum spread terrorthroughout the Hirpinian country; it submitted even beforethe arrival of the Lucanian contingent which had set itselfin motion to render help, and Sulla was able to advanceunhindered as far as the territory of the Samnite confederacy.The pass, where the Samnite militia under Mutilus awaitedhim, was turned, the Samnite army was attacked in rear, anddefeated; the camp was lost, the general escaped woundedto ^sernia. Sulla advanced to Bovianum, the capital of theSamnite country, and compelled it to surrender by a secondvictory obtained beneath its walls. The advanced seasonalone put an end to the campaign there.

instead of the colleges themselves—which the. governmenthad frustrated in the comitia in 609 by the suggestion of re- 145.ligious scruples—was carried in 650 by Gnaeus Domitius io4.without the senate having been able even to venture aserious resistance. On the whole it seemed as if nothingwas wanted but a chief, who should give to the opposition afirm rallying point and a practical aim; and this was nowfound in Marius.
For the execution of his task two methods of operationwere open; Marius might attempt to overthrow the oli­garchy either as imperator at the head of the army, or inthe mode prescribed by the constitution for constitutionalchanges: his own past career pointed to the former course,the precedent of Gracchus to the latter. It is easy tounderstand why he did not adopt the former plan, perhapsdid not even think of the possibility of adopting it. Thesenate was or seemed so powerless and helpless, so hatedand despised, that Marius conceived himself scarcely to needany other support in opposing it than his immense popu­larity, but would in case of necessity find such a support, not­withstanding the dissolution of the army, in the soldiersdischarged and waiting for their rewards. It is probable thatMarius, looking to Gracchus' easy and apparently almostcomplete victory and to his own resources far surpassingthose of Gracchus, deemed the overthrow of a constitutionfour hundred years old, and intimately bound up with thevarious habits and interests of the body-politic arrangedin a complicated hierarchy, a far easier task than it was.But any one who looked more deeply into the difficulties ofthe enterprise than Marius probably did might reflect, thatthe army, although in the course of transition from a militiato a band of mercenaries, was still during this state of transi­tion by no means adapted for the blind instrument of acoup d'etat, and that an attempt to set aside the resistingelements by military means would have probably increasedthe power of resistance in his antagonists. To mix up theorganized armed force in the struggle could not but appearat the first glance superfluous and at the second hazardous;they were just at the beginning of the crisis, and the anta­gonistic elements were still far from having reached theirlast, shortest, and simplest expression.

was probably made dependent on a permission to be pre­viously requested from the senate.* Lastly it was addedthat the holding of the tribunate should in future disqualifyfor the acceptance of a higher office—an enactment, which,like many other points in Sulla's restoration, once more re­verted to the old patrician maxims, and, just as in thetimes before the admission of the plebeians to the civil ma­gistracies, declared the tribunate and the curule offices tobe mutually incompatible. In this way the legislator ofthe oligarchy hoped to check tribunician demagogism and tokeep all ambitious and aspiring men aloof from the tribunate,but to retain it as an instrument of the senate both formediating between it and the burgesses, and, should cir­cumstances require, for keeping in check the magistrates;and, as the authority of the king and afterwards of therepublican magistrates over the burgesses scarcely anywherecomes to light so clearly as in the principle that they ex­clusively had the right of addressing the people, so thesupremacy of the senate, now first legally established, ismost distinctly apparent in this permission which the leaderof the people had to ask from the senate for every transactionwith his constituents.
The consulship and praetorship also, although viewed bythe aristocratic regenerator of Kome with a more favourableeye than the thoroughly suspicious tribunate, by no meansescaped that distrust towards its own instruments which isthroughout characteristic of oligarchy. They were restrictedwith more tenderness in point of form, but in a way verysensibly felt. Sulla here began with the partition of func­tions. At the beginning of this period the arrangement inof the con- that respect stood as follows. As formerly there had de-

That the tribunes did not alto­gether lose the right of discussing matters with the people is shown by Cic.De Leg. iii. 4,19 and more clearly by the plebiscitum de Thermensibiis, whichhowever in the opening formula also designates itself as issued de senatussententia. That the consuls on the other hand could under the Sullan arrange­ments submit proposals to the people without a previous resolution of thesenate, is shown not only by the silence of the authorities, but also by thecourse of the revolutions of 667 and 676, whose leaders for this very reasonwere not tribunes but consuls. Accordingly we find at this period consularlaws upon secondary questions of administration, such as the corn law of 681,for which at other times we should have certainly found plebiscita.

Lucullus, arrived at head-quarters, he found the war whichhe had come to conduct already terminated hy a formallyconcluded peace, and his hopes of bringing home honour andmore especially money from Spain apparently frustrated. Butthere was a means of surmounting this difficulty. Lucullusof his own accord attacked the western neighbours of theArevacae, the Vaccaei, a Celtiberian nation still independentand living on the best terms with the Romans. The questionof the Spaniards as to what fault they had committed wasanswered by a sudden attack on the town of Cauca (Coca,eight Spanish leagues to the west of Segovia); and, whilethe terrified town believed that it had purchased a capitu­lation by heavy sacrifices of money, Roman troops marchedin and enslaved or slaughtered the inhabitants without anypretext at all. After this heroic feat, which is said to havecost the lives of some 20,000 men, the army proceeded on itsmarch. Far and wide the villages and townships wereabandoned or, as in the case of the strong Intercatia andPallantia (Palencia) the capital of the Vaccaei, closed then-gates against the Roman army. Covetousness was caughtin its own net; there was no community that would ventureto conclude a capitulation with the perfidious commander,and the general flight of the inhabitants not only renderedbooty scarce, but made it almost impossible for him to re­main for any length of time in such inhospitable regions. Infront of Intercatia, Scipio iEmilianus, an esteemed militarytribune, the sen of the victor of Pydna and the adoptedgrandson of the victor of Zama, succeeded, by pledging hisword of honour when that of the general no longer availed,in inducing the inhabitants to conclude an agreement byvirtue of which the Roman army departed on receiving asupply of cattle and clothing. But the siege of Pallantiahad to be raised for want of provisions, and the Roman armyin its retreat was pursued by the Vaccaei as far as the Douro.Lucullus thereupon proceeded to the southern province,where in the same year the praetor, Servius Sulpicius Galba,had allowed himself to be defeated by the Lusitanians. Theyspent the winter not far from each other—Lucullus in theterritory of the Turdetani, Galba at Conistorgis—and in the150. following year (604) jointly attacked the Lusitanians.

Romans and Pbom the time when the defeat of Pyrrhus had put an endItalians. to the last war which the Italians had waged for their inde­pendence—or, in other words, for nearly two hundred years—the Roman primacy had now subsisted in Italy, withouthaving been once shaken in its foundations even under cir­cumstances of the utmost peril. Vainly had the heroic familyof the Barcides, vainly had the successors of Alexander theGreat and of the Achaemenidae, endeavoured to rouse theItalian nation to contend with the too powerful capital;it had obsequiously appeared in the fields of battle on theGuadalquivir and on the Mejerdah, at the pass of Tempe andat Mount Sipylus, and with the best blood of its youth hadhelped its masters to achieve the subjugation of three conti­nents. Its own position meanwhile had changed, but haddeteriorated rather than improved. In a material point ofview, no doubt, it had in general not much ground to' com­plain. Though the small and intermediate landholdersthroughout Italy suffered in consequence of the injudiciousRoman corn-laws, the larger landlords and still more themercantile and capitalist class were flourishing, for theItalians enjoyed, as respected the financial profits of theprovinces, substantially the same protection and the sameprivileges as Roman burgesses, and thus shared to a greatextent in the material advantages of the political ascendancyof the Romans.

had to be sent back in all haste to Africa, when Jugurtha'sson appeared in the enemy's ranks; we may infer from this,how great was the influence which he himself exercised overhis people. What prospect was there of a termination ofthe struggle in regions, where the combined peculiarities ofthe population and of the soil allowed a leader who hadonce secured the sympathies of the nation to protract thewar in endless guerilla conflicts, or even to let it sleep for atime in order to revive it at the right moment with renewedvigour?
When Metellus again took the field in 647, Jugurtha War [107.nowhere held his ground against him; he appeared now atin the <'°-one point, now at another far distant; it seemed as if they serUwould as easily get the better of the lions as of these horse­men of the desert. A battle was fought, a victory was won;but it was difficult to say what had been gained by the vic­tory. The king had vanished out of sight in the distance.In the interior of the modern beylik of Tunis, close on theedge of the great desert and separated from the valley ofthe Mejerdah by an arid and treeless steppe of forty-fivemiles in breadth, there were situated amidst oases providedwith springs two strong places, Thala to the north (after­wards Thelepte, near Husch-el-Cheme), and Capsa (Kafsa)further south; Jugurtha had retired to the former townwith his children, his treasures, and the flower of his troops,there to await better times. Metellus ventured to followthe king through a desert, in which his troops had to carrywater along with them in skins; Thala was reached and fellafter a forty days' siege; but the Roman deserters destroyedthe most valuable part of the booty along with the building inwhich they burnt themselves after the capture of the town,and—what was of more consequence—king Jugurtha escapedwith his children and his chest. Numidia was no doubtvirtually in the hands of the Romans; but, instead of theirobject being thereby gained, the war seemed only to extendover a field wider and wider. In the south the freeGaHulian tribes of the desert began at Jugurtha's call anational war against the Romans. In the west Bocchus Maureta-king of Mauretania, whose friendship the Romans had in riian com-earlier times despised, seemed now not indisposed to make Plications-common cause with his son-in-law against them; he notonly received him at his court, but, uniting to Jugurtha'sfollowers his own numberless swarms of horsemen, he

But by far the larger portion of the city still remained Destructionstanding. We may believe that Scipio desired its preserva- ofCarthage.tion; at least he addressed a special inquiry to.the senate onthe subject. Scipio Nasica once more attempted to gain ahearing for the demands of reason and honour; but invain. The senate ordered the general to level the city ofCarthage and the suburb of Magalia with the ground, and todo the same with all the places which had held by Carthageto the last; and thereafter to pass the plough over the siteof Carthage so as to put an end in legal form to theexistence of the city, and to curse the soil and site for ever,that neither house nor cornfield might ever reappear on thespot. The command was punctually obeyed. The ruinsburned for seventeen days : recently, when the remains of theCarthaginian city wall were excavated, they were found tobe covered with a layer of ashes from four to five feet deep,filled with half-charred pieces of wood, fragments of iron,and projectiles. Where the industrious Phoenicians hadbustled and trafficked for five hundred years, Roman slaveshenceforth pastured the herds of their distant masters.Scipio, however, whom nature had destined for a noblerpart than that of an executioner, gazed with horror on hisown work; and, instead of the joy of victory, the victorhimself was haunted by a presentiment of the retributionthat would inevitably follow such a misdeed.
Arrangements had still to be made as to the future Province oforganization of the courttry. The earlier plan of investing Africa,the allies of Rome with the transmarine possessions thatshe acquired was no longer viewed with favour. Micipsaand his brothers retained in substance their former territory,including the districts recently wrested from the Cartha­ginians on the Bagradas and in Emporia; their long-cherished hope of obtaining Carthage as a capital was forever frustrated; the senate presented them instead withthe Carthaginian libraries. The Carthaginian territory aspossessed by the city in its last days—viz., the narrowborder of the African coast lying immediately opposite toSicily, from the river Tusca (AVady Saine, opposite to theisland of Galita) to Thena e (opposite to the island ofKarkenah)—became a Roman province.

But, if their predecessors had donelittle, these did nothing at all. Instead of prosecuting thesiege of Carthage or subduing the army of Hasdrubal, Pisoemployed himself in attacking the small maritime towns ofthe Phoenicians, and that mostly without success. Clupea,for example, repulsed him, aud he was obliged to retire iudisgrace from Hippo Diarrhytus, after having lost the wholesummer in front of it and having had his besieging appa­ratus twice burnt. Neapolis was no doubt taken; but thepillage of the town in opposition to his pledged word ofhonour was not specially favourable to the progress of theRoman arms. The courage of the Carthaginians rose.Bithyas, a Numidian sheik, passed over to them with 800horse; Carthaginian envoys were enabled to attempt negotia­tions with the kings of Numidia and Mauretanin and evenwith Philip the Macedonian pretender. It was perhapsinternal intrigues—Hasdrubal the emigrant brought thegeneral of the same name, who commanded in the city, intosuspicion on account of his relationship with Massinissa,and caused him to be put to death in the senate-house—rather than the activity of the Romans, that preventedthings from assuming a turn still more favourable forCarthage.Ssipio.Emi- With the view of producing a change in the state of

It was of more moment thatan agreement should be come to with the Samnites andNolans, so that the troops of the thoroughly trustworthyMetellus might be employed for the protection of thecapital. But the Samnites made demands which recalledthe yoke of Caudium—restitution of the spoil taken fromthe Samnites and of their prisoners and deserters, renun­ciation of the booty wrested by the Samnites from theEomans, the bestowal of the franchise on the Samnitesthemselves as well as on the Romans who had passed overto them. The senate rejected even in this emergencyterms of peace so disgraceful, but instructed Metellus toleave behind a small division and to lead in person all thetroops that could at all be dispensed with in southernItaly as quickly as possible to Rome. He obeyed. But theconsequence was, that the Samnites attacked and defeatedPlautius the legate left behind by Metellus and his weakband; that the garrison of Nola marched out and set onfire the neighbouring town of Abella in alliance with Bome;that Cinna and Marius, moreover, granted to the Samniteseverything they asked—what mattered Roman honour tothem ?—and a Samnite contingent reinforced the ranks ofthe insurgents. It was a severe loss also, when after acombat unfavourable to the troops of the governmentAriminum was occupied by the insurgents, and thus theimportant communication between Rome and the valley ofthe Po, whence men and supplies were expected, was inter­rupted.

After two years of hardstruggles—Aquillius is said to have fought in person withAthenion, and to have killed him in single combat—theRoman general at length put down the desperate resistance,and vanquished the insurgents in their last retreats byfamine. The slaves on the island were prohibited frombearing arms and peace was again restored to it, or, in otherwords, its recent scourges were relieved by its formertormentors; in fact, the victor himself occupied a promi­nent place among the numerous and energetic robber-magi­strates of this period.

This case clearly showed that the Romangovernment had changed its system, and had resolved tosubstitute the relation of subjection for that of dependence;and accordingly the suppression of the four Macedonianconfederacies was felt throughout the whole range of theclient-states as a blow directed against all.

the contribution had been not merely suspended, but remittedby the Romans. Thereupon Nobilior appeared in HitherSpain with an army of nearly 30,000 men, including someNumidian horsemen and ten elephants. The walls of thenew town of Segeda still stood unfinished: most of theinhabitants submitted. But the most resolute men fledwith their wives and children to the powerful Arevacae, andsummoned these to make common cause with them againstthe Romans. The Arevacae, emboldened by the victory ofthe Lusitanians over Mummius, consented, and chose Carus,one of the Segedan refugees, as their general. On the thirdday after his election the valiant leader had fallen, but theRoman army was defeated and nearly 6000 Roman burgesseswere slain; the 23rd day of August, the festival of theVulcanalia, was thenceforth held in sad remembrance bythe Romans. The fall of their general, however, inducedthe Arevacae to retreat into their strongest town Nu-mantia (Guarray, a Spanish league to the north of Soria onthe Douro), whither Nobilior followed them. Under thewalls of the town a second engagement took place, in whichthe Romans at first by means of their elephants drove theSpaniards back into the town; but while doing so they werethrown into confusion in consequence of one of the animalsbeing wounded, and sustained a second defeat at the handsof the enemy again issuing from the walls. This and othermisfortunes—such as the destruction of a corps of Romancavalry despatched to call forth the contingents—impartedto the affairs of the Romans in the Hither province so un­favourable an aspect that the fortress of Ocilis, where theRomans had their chest and their stores, passed over to theenemy, and the Arevaca e were in a position to think of dictat­ing peace, although without success, to the Romans. Thesedisadvantages, however, were in some measure counter­balanced by the successes which Mummius achieved in thesouthern province. Weakened though his army was by thedisaster which it had suffered, he yet succeeded in inflicting adefeat on the Lusitanians who were imprudently scatteredon the right bank of the Tagus; and passing over to the leftbank, where the Lusitanians had overrun the whole Romanterritory and had even made a foray into Africa, he clearedthe southern province of the enemy.152.

from the historical side; although the dissertations of theunwieldy annalists of this age, such as those of Hemina " onthe Censors " and of Tuditanus "on the Magistrates" canhardly have been better than their chronicles. Of moreinterest were the treatise on the magistracies by MarcusJunius the friend of Gaius Gracchus, as the first attempt tomake the investigation of antiquity serviceable for politicalobjects,* and the metrically composed Didascalice of thetragedian Accius, an essay towards a literary history of theLatin drama. But those early attempts at a scientifictreatment of the mother-tongue still bear a very unscien­tific stamp, and strikingly remind us of our orthographicliterature in the Bodmer-Klopstock period; and we maylikewise without injustice assign but a modest place to the
Stilo. antiquarian researches of this epoch. The Roman, who
established the investigation of the Latin language andantiquities in the spirit of the Alexandrian masters on a100. scientific basis, was Lucius iElius Stilo about 650 (P. 442).He first went back to the oldest monuments of the lan­guage, and commented on the Salian litanies and theTwelve Tables. He devoted his special attention to thecomedy of the sixth century, and first formed a list of thepieces of Plautus which in his opinion were genuine. Hesought after the Greek fashion to determine historicallythe origin of every single phenomenon in the Eoman lifeand dealings and to ascertain in each case the "inventor,"and at the same time brought the whole annalistic traditionwithin the range of his research. The success, which he hadamong his contemporaries, is attested by the dedication tohim of the most important poetical, and the most importanthistorical, works of his time, the Satires of Lucilius and theAnnals of Antipater; and this first Soman philologistinfluenced the studies of his nation also in future timesby transmitting his spirit of investigation both into wordsand into things to his disciple Varro.
Rhetoric. The literary activity in the field of Latin rhetoric was, as

force of arms. Justice moreover was exercised, as the victorsunderstood the term. The most noted adherents of Mithra-dates and the authors of the massacre of the Italians werepunished with death. The persons liable to taxes were obligedimmediately to pay down in cash according to valuation thewhole arrears of tenths and customs for the last five years;besides which they had to pay a war-indemnity of 20,000talents (£4,880,000) for the collection of which Luculluswas left behind. These were measures fearful in theirrigour and dreadful in their effects; but, when we recall theEphesian decree and its execution, we feel inclined to regardthem as a comparatively mild retaliation. That their exac­tions in other respects were not unusually oppressive, isshown by the value of the spoil afterwards carried intriumph, which amounted in precious metal to only about£1,000,000. The few communities on the other hand thathad remained faithful—particularly the island of Rhodes, theprovince of Lycia, Magnesia on the Maeander—were richlyrewarded; Rhodes received back at least a portion of thepossessions withdrawn from it after the war against Perseus(ii. 307). In like manner compensation was made as far aspossible by free charters and special favours to the Chiansfor the hardships which they had borne, and to the Iliensesfor the insanely cruel maltreatment inflicted on them byTimbria on account of the negotiations into which they hadentered with Sulla. Sulla had already brought the kings ofBithynia and Cappadocia to meet the Pontic king at Dar-danus, and had made them all promise to live in peace andgood neighbourhood ; on which occasion, however, thehaughty Mithradates had refused to admit Ariobarzanes whowas not descended of royal blood—the slave, as he calledhim—to his presence. Gaius Scribonius Curio was commis­sioned to superintend the restoration of the legal order ofthings in the two kingdoms evacuated by Mithradates.
The goal was thus attained. After four years of war thePontic king was again a client of the Romans, and a singleand settled government was restored in Greece, Macedonia,and Asia Minor; the requirements of interest and honourwere satisfied, if not adequately, yet so far as circumstanceswould allow; Sulla had not only brilliantly distinguishedhimself as a soldier and general, but had the skill in a pathcrossed by a thousand obstacles to preserve the difficultmean between bold perseverance and prudent concession.

at that time naked and open to the eyes of all. Of the twoconsuls of this year, the one fought without success in Sicilyagainst the revolted slaves, and the other, Scipio .Smilianus,was employed for months not in conquering, but in crush­ing a small Spanish country town. If Gracchus still neededa special summons to carry his resolution into effect, hefound it in this state of matters, which filled the mind of everypatriot with unspeakable anxiety. His father-in-law pro­mised assistance in counsel and action; the support of thejurist Scaevola, who had shortly before been elected consul133. for 621, might be hoped for. So Gracchus, immediatelyHis agrarian after entering on office, proposed the enactment of an agra-law. riall laW, which in a certain sense was nothing but a renewal
367. of the Licinio-Sextian law of 387 (i. 304). Under it allthe state-lands which were occupied and enjoyed by thepossessors without remuneration—those that were let onlease, such as the territory of Capua, were not affected bythe law—were to be resumed on behalf of the state; but withthe restriction, that each occupier should reserve for himself500 jugera and for each son 250 (so as not, however, toexceed 1000 jugera in all) in permanent and guaranteed pos­session, or should be entitled to claim compensation in landto that extent. Indemnification appears to have been grantedfor any improvements executed by the former holders, such asbuildings and plantations. The domain land thus resumedwas to be broken up into lots of 30 jugera; and thesewere to be distributed partly to burgesses, partly to Italianallies, not as their own free property, but as inalienableheritable leaseholds, whose holders bound themselves to usethe land for agriculture and to pay a moderate rent to thestate. A collegium of three men, who were regarded asordinary and standing magistrates of the state and wereannually elected by the assembly of the people, was in­trusted with the work of confiscation and distribution; towhich was afterwards added the important and difficultfunction of legally settling what was domain land, and whatwas private property. The distribution was accordingly de­signed to go on continuously, and to embrace the whole classthat should be in need of it; and in that view we must pro­bably assume that, when the Italian domains which werevery extensive and difficult of adjustment should be finallyregulated, further measures were contemplated, such as,for instance, the disbursement to the allotment-commis­

on the frontiers and the pirates. When the central govern­ment renounced all superintendence and all oversight of pro­vincial affairs, it entirely abandoned not only the interestsof the subjects, but also those of the state, to the governorof the day. The events which occurred in Spain, unimpor­tant in themselves, are instructive in this respect. In thatcountry, where the government was less able than in otherprovinces to confine itself to the part of a mere onlooker,the law of nations was directly trampled under foot by theRoman governors; and the honour of Some was permanentlydragged in the mire by a perfidy and faithlessness withoutparallel, by the most wanton trifling with capitulations andtreaties, by massacring men who had submitted and insti­gating the assassination of the generals of the enemy. Norwas this all; war was even waged and peace concludedagainst the expressed will of the supreme authority in Rome,and unimportant incidents, such as the disobedience of theNumantines, were developed by a rare combination of per­versity and folly into a crisis of fatal moment for the state.And all this took place without any effort to visit it witheven a serious penalty in Rome. The sympathies and rival­ries of the different coteries in the senate contributedto determine the filling up of the most important placesand the treatment of the most momentous political ques­tions; and even thus early the money of foreign dynastsfound its way to the senators of Rome. Timarchus, the164. envoy of Antiochus Epiphanes king of Syria (+ 590),ismen-tioned as the first who attempted with success to bribe theRoman senate; the bestowal of presents from foreign kingson influential senators soon became so common, that surprisewas excited when Scipio .32milianus cast into the militarychest the gifts from the king of Syria which reached himin camp before Numantia. The ancient principle, thatrule was its own sole reward and that such rule was as mucha duty and a burden as a privilege and a benefit, was allowedto fall into abeyance. Thus there arose the new political eco­nomy, which desisted from the taxation of the burgesses, butregarded the body of subjects, on the other hand, as a pro­fitable possession of the community, which it partly workedout for the public benefit, partly handed over to be workedout by the burgesses.

Never sincethe commencement of the revolution had the government ofthe restoration been so firmly established, or so popular.Consular laws were substituted for tribunician; restrictionson liberty replaced measures of progress.

Next year (656) a law broughtin by the two consuls made the usual seven days' intervalbetween the introduction and the passing of a project of lawobligatory, and forbade the combination of several enactmentsdifferent in their nature in one proposal; by which means theunreasonable extent of the initiative power in legislation wasat least somewhat restricted, and the government was pre­vented from being openly taken by surprise with newlaws. It became daily more evident that the Gracchan con­stitution, which had survived the fall of its author, was now,since the multitude and the moneyed aristocracy no longerwent together, tottering to its foundations. As that consti­tution had been based on a division in the ranks of the aris­tocracy, so it seemed that dissensions in the ranks of theopposition could not fail to bring about its fall.

Marius, who held the chief command, wouldgladly have saved the life of his former allies who were nowhis prisoners; Saturninus exclaimed to the multitude, thatall which he had proposed had been done in concert withthe consul: even a worse man than Marius was could notbut shudder at the inglorious part which he played on thisday. But he had long ceased to be master of affairs. With­out orders the young nobles climbed the roof of the senate-house in the Forum where the prisoners were temporarilyconfined, stripped off the tiles, and stoned the prisonerswith them. Thus Saturninus perished with most of themore notable prisoners. Glaucia was found in a lurking-place, and likewise put to death. Without sentence ortrial there died on this day four magistrates of the Romanpeople—a praetor, a quaestor, and two tribunes of the people—and a number of other well-known men, some of whombelonged to good families. In spite of the grave faults,by which the chiefs had invited on themselves this bloody-retribution, we may nevertheless lament them: they felllike advanced posts, which are left unsupported by the mainarmy and are forced to perish without object in a conflict ofdespair.

By the defection of thistown, which lay on the military road from Campania toSamnium, .32sernia was isolated, and that fortress alreadystrongly assailed found itself now exclusively dependent onthe courage and perseverance of its garrison and its com­mandant Marcellus.

great conflict between labour and capital, it is necessary to givehere some indication of the nature and extent of the systemof slavery. We have not now to do with the old, in somemeasure innocent, rural slavery, under which the farmereither tilled the field along with his slave or, if he' possessedmore land than he could manage, placed the slave—either assteward or as a sort of lessee obliged to render up a portionof the produce—over a detached farm (i. 199). Such relationsno doubt existed at all times—around Comum, for instance,they were still the rule in the time of the Empire—but asexceptional features in privileged districts and on humanelymanaged estates. What we now refer to is the systemof slavery on a great scale, which in the Roman state, asformerly in the Carthaginian, grew out of the ascendancy ofcapital. While the captives taken in war and the hereditarytransmission of slavery sufliced to keep up the stock of slavesduring the earlier period, this system of slavery was, justlike that of America, based on the methodically prosecutedhunting of man; for, owing to the manner in which slaveswere used with little regard to their life or propagation, theslave population was constantly on the wane, and even thewars which were always furnishing new multitudes to theslave market were not sufficient to cover the deficit. Nocountry where this species of game could be hunted re­mained exempt from visitation; even in Italy it was a thingby no means unheard of, that the poor free man was placedby his employer among the slaves. But the Negroland ofthat period was western Asia,* where the Cretan and Cili-cian corsairs, the real professional slave-hunters and slave-dealers, robbed the coasts of Syria and the Greek islands;and where, emulating their feats, the Roman revenue-farmersinstituted human hunts in the client states and incor­porated those whom they captured among their slaves.This was done to such an extent, that about 650 the kingof Bithynia declared himself unable to furnish the requiredcontingent, because all the people capable of labour hadbeen dragged off from his kingdom by the revenue-farmers.At the great slave market in Delos, where the slave-dealersof Asia Minor disposed of their wares to Italian speculators,on one day as many as 10,000 slaves are said to have been

each successive demand more intolerable than its predeces­sor; and at length they were required even to surrendertheir arms. Then Viriathus recollected the fate of hiscountrymen whom Galba had caused to be disarmed, andgrasped his sword afresh. But it was already too late. Hiswavering had sown the seeds of treachery among those whowere immediately around him; three of his confidants,Audas, Ditalco, and Minurus from Urso, despairing of thepossibility of renewed victory, procured from the king per­mission once more to enter into negotiations for peace withCaepio, and employed it for the purpose of selling the life ofthe Lusitanian hero to the foreigners in return for the assur­ance of personal amnesty and further rewards. On theirreturn to the camp they assured the king of the favourableissue of their negotiations, and in The following night stabbedhim while asleep in his tent. The Lusitanians honoured theillustrious chief by an unparalleled funeral solemnity atwhich two hundred pairs of champions fought in the funeralgames; and still more highly by the fact, that they did notrenounce the struggle, but nominated Tautamus as theircommander-in-chief in room of the fallen hero. The planprojected by the latter for wresting Saguntum from theRomans was sufficiently bold ; but the new general possessedneither the wise moderation nor the military skill of his pre­decessor. The expedition was a total failure, and the armyon its return was attacked in crossing the Baetis and com­pelled to surrender unconditionally. Thus was Lusitaniasubdued, far more by treachery and assassination on the partof foreigners and natives than by honourable war.
While the southern province was scourged by Viriathus Numantia.and the Lusitanians, a second and not less serious war had,not without their help, broken out in the northern provinceamong the Celtiberian nations. The brilliant successes ofViriathus induced the Arevacae likewise in 610 to rise 144.against the Romans; and on that account the consulQuintus Cacilius Metellus, who was sent to Spain torelieve Maximus TEmilianus, did not proceed to thesouthern province, but turned against the Celtiberians.In the contest with them, and more especially duringthe siege of the town of Contrebia which was deemedimpregnable, he showed the same ability which he haddisplayed in vanquishing the Macedonian pretender; afterhis two years' administration (611, 612) the northern pro- 143. 142.

more pliant than from their rigorous principles we shouldhave expected. Their doctrine as to the gods and the statesoon exhibited a singular family resemblance to the actualinstitutions of those who nourished them; instead of illus­trating the cosmopolitan state of the philosopher, they madetheir meditations turn on the wise organization of theRoman magistracies; and while the more refined Stoicssuch as Panaetius had left the question of divine revelationby wonders and signs open as a thing conceivable but un­certain and had decidedly rejected astrology, his immediatesuccessors contended for that doctrine of revelation or, inother words, for the Roman augural discipline as rigidlyand firmly as for any other maxim of the school, and madeextremely unphilosophical concessions even to astrology.The leading feature of the system came more and more tobe its casuistic doctrine of duty. It suited the hollow prideof virtue, in which the Romans of this period sought their;compensation amidst the various humbling circumstances oftheir contact with the Greeks, and put into formal shape abefitting doctrine of morality; which, like every well-bredsystem of morals, combined with the most rigid precisionas a whole the most complaisant indulgence in the details.*Its practical results can hardly be estimated as much morethan that, as we have said, two or three noble houses livedon poor fare to please the Stoa.
Closely allied to this new state-philosophy—or, strictly Statespeaking, its other side—was the new state-religion; the religion.essential characteristic of which was the conscious retentionof the principles of the popular faith, which were recog­nized as irrational, for reasons of outward convenience.One of the most prominent men of the Scipionic circle, theGreek Polybius, candidly declares that the strange and pon­derous ceremonial of Roman religion was invented solelyon account of the multitude, which, as reason had no powerover it, required to be ruled by signs and wonders, whilepeople of intelligence had certainly no need of religion.Beyond doubt Polybius' Roman friends substantially sharedthese sentiments, although they did not oppose science andreligion to each other in so gross and downright a fashion.Neither Laelius nor Scipio jEmilianus can have looked onthe augural discipline, which Polybius has primarily in

It is true that thisnew mode of juvenile instruction, revolutionary and anti-national as it was, encountered partially the resistance ofthe government; but the edict of dismissal, which theauthorities in 593 fulminated against rhetoricians and phi- ici.losophers, remained (chiefly owing to the constant changeof the Roman chief magistrates) like all similar commandswithout any result worth mentioning, and after the deathof old Cato there were still perhaps frequent complaintsin accordance with his views, but there was no furtheraction. The higher instruction in Greek and in the sciencesof Greek culture remained thenceforth recognized as anessential part of Italian training.
But by its side there sprung up also a higher Latin Latin in-instruction. We have shown in the previous epoch how stiuction.Latin elementary instruction raised its character; how theplace of the Twelve Tables was taken by the Latin Odysseyas it were by an improved primer, and the Poman boy wasnow trained to the knowledge and delivery of his mother-tongue by means of this translation, as the Greek by meansof the original: how noted teachers of the Greek languageand literature, Andronicus, Ennius, and others, who alreadyprobably taught not children properly so called but boysgrowing up to maturity and young men, did not disdain togive instruction in the mother-tongue along with the Greek.These were the first steps towards a higher Latin instruc­tion, but they did not as yet form such an instruction itself.Instruction in a language cannot go beyond the elementarystage, so long as it wants a literature. It was not until therewere not merely Latin schoolbooks but a Latin literature, andthat literature subsisted with a certain completeness in theworks of the classics of the sixth century, that the mother-tongue and the native literature truly entered the circle ofthe elements of higher culture; and the emancipation fromthe Greek schoolmasters was now not slow to follow.

The Numantines, thus deprived oftheir last hope, sent to Scipio to negotiate as-to their sub­mission and called on the brave man to spare the brave;but when the envoys on their return announced that Scipiorequired unconditional surrender, they were torn in piecesby the furious multitude, and a fresh interval elapsed tillfamine and pestilence had completed their work. At lengtha second message was sent to the Roman head-quarters,that the town was now ready to submit at discretion.When the citizens were accordingly instructed to appear onthe following day before the gates, they asked for some days'delay, to allow those of their number who had determinednot to survive the loss of liberty time to die. It wasgranted, and not a few took advantage of it. At last themiserable remnant appeared before the gates. Scipio chosefifty of the most eminent to form part of his triumphalprocession; the rest were sold into slavery, the city waslevelled with the ground, and its territory was distributedamong the neighbouring towns. This occurred in the133. autumn of 621, fifteen months after Scipio had assumed thecommand.

CHAPTER VI.
THE ATTEMPT OF MARIUS AT REVOLUTION AND THEATTEMPT OF DRUSUS AT REFORM.
Marius. Gaics Marius, the son of a poor day-labourer, was born in155. 599 at the village of Cereatae then belonging to Arpinum,which, afterwards obtained municipal rights as CereatsMarianae and still at the present day bears the name of"Marius' Home" (Casamare). He was reared at theplough, in circumstances so mean that they seemed to pre­clude him from access even to the magistracies of Arpinum:he learned early—what he practised afterwards even when ageneral—to bear hunger and thirst, the heat of summer andthe cold of winter, and to sleep on the hard ground. Assoon as his age allowed him, he had entered the army, andin the severe school of the Spanish wars had rapidly raisedhimself to the position of an officer. In Scipio's Numantinewar he, at that time twenty-three years of age, attracted thenotice of the stern general by the neatness with which hekept his horse and his accoutrements, as well as by hisbravery in combat and his propriety of demeanour in camp.He had returned home with honourable scars and warlikedistinctions, and with the ardent wish to make himself aname in the career on which he had gloriously entered; but,as matters then stood, a man of even the highest merit couldnot attain those political offices, which alone led to thehigher military posts, without wealth and without connec­tions. The young officer acquired both by fortunate com­mercial speculations and by his union with a maiden of theancient patrician gens of the Julii. So by dint of great efforts115. and after various rejections he succeeded, in 639, in attain­ing the praetorship, in which he found opportunity of dis­

MeanwhileSulla himself on the right wing led his cavalry againstthe exposed flank of the enemy; the Asiatic infantry gaveway before it was even properly engaged, and its giving waycarried confusion also into the masses of the cavalry. Ageneral attack of the Roman infantry, which through thewavering demeanour of the hostile cavalry gained time tobreathe, decided the victory. The closing of the gates ofthe camp, which Archelaus ordered to check the flight, onlyincreased the slaughter, and when the gates at length wereopened, the Romans entered at the same time with theAsiatics. It is said that Archelaus brought not a twelfthpart of his force in safety to Ohalcis; Sulla followed him tothe Euripus; he was not in a position to cross that narrowarm of the sea.

The sea was still exclusivelycovered by Pontic squadrons, which now showed themselveseven to the westward of the Malean promontory; even afterthe battle of Chaeronea Archelaus landed troops on Zacyn-thus and made an attempt to establish himself on thatisland.

ButFlaccus, after he had opportunity of convincing himself thatSulla's soldiers were by no means inclined to betray theirvictorious leader to the totally unknown democratic com­mander-in-chief, but that on the contrary his own advancedguard began to desert to Sulla's camp, evaded a conflict towhich be was in no respect equal, and set out towards thenorth, with the view of getting through Macedonia and

Perpetual civil wars, notwithstanding the Roman efforts tobring about peace, converted one flourishing township afteranother on the old " island of the hundred cities " into heapsof ruins. Its inhabitants roamed as robbers at home andabroad, by land and by sea; the island became the recruit­ing ground for the surrounding kingdoms after that evil wasno longer tolerated in the Peloponnesus, and above allthe true seat of piracy, about this period, for instance, theisland of Siphnus was thoroughly pillaged by a fleet ofCretan corsairs.

home for this buccaneering system. Piracy there not onlygained ground owing to the impotence of the Syrian rulers, butthe usurper Diodotus Tryphon, who had risen from a slave to146-139. be king of Syria (608-615), encouraged it by all means in hischief seat, the rugged or western Cilicia, with a view tostrengthen his throne by the aid of the corsairs. The uncom­monly lucrative character of the traffic with the pirates, whowere at once the principal captors of, and dealers in, slaves,procured for them among the mercantile public, even inAlexandria, Rhodes, and Delos, a certain toleration, in whicheven the governments sympathized at least by inaction.143.

They brought tribunician intercession to bear againstboth laws ;- Saturninus ordered the voting to go on.

Lastly the urbanquaestor, Quintus Caepio, the son, it may be presumed, of thegeneral condemned three years before,* and like his father avehement antagonist of the popular party, with a band of de­voted partisans dispersed the comitia by violence.

The scandal was grievous; but when it came tothe question whether the senate would comply with theclause of the law, that within five days after its passingevery senator should on pain of forfeiting his senatorial seattake an oath faithfully to observe it, all the senators tookthe oath with the single exception of Quintus Metellus, whopreferred to go into exile.

African affairs, which excited uneasiness, the Romans re­sorted to the extraordinary measure of intrusting theconduct of the war to the only man who had as yet broughthome honour from the Libyan plains, and who was recom­mended for this war by his very name. Instead of callingScipio to the aedileship for which he was a candidate, theygave to him the consulship before the usual time, settingaside the laws to the contrary effect, and committed to himby special decree the conduct of the African war. Hearrived (607) in Utica at a very critical moment. The 147.Roman admiral Mancinus, charged by Piso with the nominalcontinuance of the siege of the capital, had- occupied a steepcliff, far remote from the inhabited district and scarcelydefended, on the almost inaccessible seaward side of thesuburb of Magalia, and had united nearly his whole not verynumerous force there, in the hope of being able to pene­trate thence into the outer town. In fact the assailantshad been for a moment within its gates and the camp-followers had flocked forward in a body in the hope ofspoil, when they were again driven back to the cliff and,being without supplies and almost cut off, were in thegreatest danger. Scipio found matters in that position. Hehad hardly arrived when he despatched the troops which hehad brought with him and the militia of Utica by sea to thethreatened point, and succeeded in saving its garrison andholding the cliff itself. After this danger was averted, thegeneral proceeded to the camp of Piso to take the commandand bring the army back to Carthage. Hasdrubal andBithyas availed themselves of his absence to move theircamp immediately up to the city, and to renew the attack onthe garrison of the cliff before Magalia; but Scipio appearedwith the vanguard of the main army in sufficient time toafford assistance to the post. So the siege began afresh andmore earnestly. First of all Scipio cleared the camp of themass of camp-followers and sutlers and once more tightenedthe relaxed reins of discipline. Military operations weresoon resumed with increased vigour. In an attack by nighton the suburb the Romans succeeded in passing from atower—placed in front of the walls and equal to them inheight—on to the battlements, and opened a little gatethrough which the whole army entered.

It.is true that the worst despondency had been diminishedafter the victories achieved by Caesar at Acerrae and byStrabo in Picenum: on the news of the former the war-dressin the capital had been once more exchanged for the dressof the citizen, on the news of the second the signs of publicmourning had been laid aside; but it was not doubtful thaton the whole the Romans had been worsted in this passageof arms: and above all the senate and the burgesses hadlost the spirit, which had formerly borne them to victorythrough the crises of the Hannibalic war. They stillperhaps began war with the same haughty arrogance asthen, but they knew not how to end it as they had then done;rigid obstinacy, tenacious persistence had given place to aremiss and cowardly disposition. Already after the first yearof war their outward and inward policy became suddenlychanged, and betook itself to compromise. There is no doubtthat in this they did the wisest thing which could be done;not however because, compelled by the immediate force ofarms, they could not avoid acquiescing in disadvantageousconditions, but because the subject-matter of dispute,—theperpetuation of the political precedence of the Romans overthe other Italians—was injurious rather than beneficial to thecommonwealth itself.

The discipline of sufferingwhich he had undergone, and his compulsory reserve duringthe last nine years, augmented his energy of purpose andaction; the indignation repressed within the depths of hisbreast only glowed there with an intensified fervour againstthe party, which had disturbed his country and murdered hisbrother. By virtue of this fearful vehemence of tempera­ment he became the foremost orator that Home ever had;without it, we should probably have been able to reckonhim among the first statesmen of all times. Among the fewremains of his recorded orations several* are, even in theirpresent condition, of heart-stirring power; and we can wellunderstand how those who heard or even merely read themwere carried away by the impetuous torrent of his words.Yet, great master as he was of language, he was himself notunfrequently mastered by anger, so that the utterance ofthe brilliant speaker became confused or faltering. It wasthe true image of his political acting and suffering. In thenature of Gaius there was uo vein, such as his brother had,of that somewhat sentimental but very short-sighted andconfused good-nature, which would have desired to changethe mind of a political opponent by entreaties and tears;fully and firmly resolved, he entered on the career of revo­lution, and strove to reach the goal of vengeance.

But if this is not possible,then may our enemies continue and remain what they are, athousand times rather than that our country should perish."Cornelia knew her son; his creed was just the reverse.Vengeance he would wreak on' the wretched government,vengeance at any price, though he himself and even thecommonwealth were to be ruined by it.

and Etruria, in which the class of free farmers had mostly dis­appeared, while in others, such as the valleys of the Abruzzi,the same class still maintained a tolerable footing or wasalmost unaffected—just as a similar diversity could be pointedout in the different Roman tribes. On the other hand, thepolitical inferiority of Italy was daily more harshly andmore abruptly displayed. No formal open breach of rightindeed occurred, at least in the principal questions. Thecommunal freedom, which under the name of sovereignty wasaccorded by treaty to the Itahan communities, was on thewhole respected by the Roman government; the attack, whichthe Roman reform party at the commencement of the agra­rian agitation made on the Roman domains guaranteed to themore privileged communities, had not only been earnestlyopposed by the strictly conservative as well as by the middleparty in Rome, but had been very soon abandoned by theRoman opposition itself. But the rights, which belongedand could not but belong to Rome as the leading community—the supreme conduct of war-affairs, and the superintend­ence of the whole administration,—were exercised in a way Disabilitieswhich was almost as bad as if the allies had been directly de- and wrongsclared to be subjects without rights. The numerous modifi- ?f tlie sub"cations of the fearfully severe Roman martial law, which jecwere introduced at Rome in the course of the seventh cen­tury, seem to have remained wholly limited to the Romanburgess-soldiers: this is certain as to the most important,the abolition of executions by martial law (P. 112), and wemay easily conceive the impression which was produced when,as happened in the Jugurthine war, esteemed Latin officers'were beheaded by sentence of the Roman council of war,while the lowest burgess-soldier had the right in the likecase of presenting an appeal to the civil tribunals of Rome.The proportions in which the burgesses and Italian allieswere to be drawn for military service had, as was fair, re­mained undefined by treaty; but, while in earlier times thetwo had furnished on an average equal numbers of soldiers(i. 112,351), now, although the proportions of the populationhad changed probably in favour of the burgesses rather thanto their disadvantage, the demands on the allies were bydegrees increased disproportionately (i. 436, ii. 333), sothat on the one hand they had the chief burden of theheavier and more costly service imposed on them, and onthe other band there were two allies now regularly levied

how far the Romans had carried out the dissolution of thelarger Italian confederacies (i. 435); but it is not impro­bable that the Marsians, the Paelignians, and perhaps eventhe Samnites and Lucanians still preserved their old formsof federation, though these had lost their political signifi­cance and were in some cases probably reduced to mere asso­ciations for festivals and sacrifices. The insurrection, if itshould now begin, would still find a rallying point in theseunions; but who could say how soon the Romans wouldproceed to abolish these also? The secret league, more­over, which was alleged to be headed by Drusus, had lost inhim its actual or expected head, but it continued to exist andafforded an important nucleus for the political organizationof the insurrection; while its' military organization might bebased on the fact that each allied town possessed its ownarmament and experienced soldiers. In Rome on the otherhand no serious preparations had been made. It was re-
forted, indeed, that restless movements were occurring intaly, and that the communities of the allies maintained aremarkable intercourse with each other; but instead of call­ing the citizens in all haste to arms, the governing corporationcontented itself with exhorting the magistrates in the cus­tomary fashion to watchfulness and with sending out spiesto learn further particulars. The capital was so totally unde­fended, that a resolute Marsian officer Quintus PompaediusBilo, one of the most intimate friends of Drusus, is said tohave formed the design of stealing into the city at the headof a band of trusty associates carrying swords under theirclothes, and of seizing it by a coup de main.

TheEuganei and Veneti had long been peaceful subjects of theRomans; whereas the peoples of the Alps proper were notonly still free, but made regular forays down from theirmountains into the plain between the Alps and the Po,where they were not content with levying contributions,but conducted themselves with fearful cruelty in the placeswhich they captured, not unfrequently slaughtering thewhole male population down to the infant in the cradle—thepractical answer, it may be presumed, to the Roman razziasin the Alpine valleys.

Hope and deliverance were out ofthe question; sound policy enjoined even now an uncondi­tional submission. But the voice of the few who coun­selled the acceptance of what was inevitable was, likethe call of the pilot during a hurricane, drowned amidstthe furious yells of the multitude; which, in its frantic rage,laid hands on the magistrates of the city who had counselledthe surrender of the hostages and arms, made such of the inno­cent bearers of the news as had ventured at all to return homeexpiate their terrible tidings, and tore in pieces the Italianswho chanced to be sojourning in the city by way of avengingbeforehand, at least on them, the destruction of its nativehome. No resolution was taken to defend themselves; un­armed as they were, this was a matter of course.

Almost withoutdesiring it, Sulla had become the most famous general ofhis time and the shield of the oligarchy. New and moreformidable crises ensued—the Mithradatic war, the Cinnanrevolution; Sulla's star continued always in the ascendant.Like the captain who seeks not to quench the flames of hisburning ship but continues to fire on the enemy, Sulla,while the revolution was raging in Italy, persevered un­shaken in Asia till the public foe was subdued. So soon ashe had done with that foe, he crushed the reign of anarchyand saved the capital from the firebrands of the desperateSamnites and revolutionists. The moment of his returnhome was for Sulla an overpowering one in joy and in pain:he himself relates in his memoirs that during his first nightin Rome he had not been able to close an eye, and we maywell believe it. But still his task was not at an end; hisstar was destined to rise still higher. Absolute autocrat aswas ever any king, and yet constantly bent on abiding bythe ground of formal right, he bridled the ultra-reactionaryparty, annihilated the Gracchan constitution which hadfor forty years restrained the oligarchy, and compelled firstthe. powers of the capitalists and of the urban proletariatewhich had entered into rivalry with the oligarchy, and ulti­mately the arrogance of the sword which had grown up inthe bosom of his own staff, to yield once more to the lawwhich he fortified afresh. He established the oligarchy on amore independent footing than ever, placed the magisterialpower as a ministering instrument in its hands, committedto it the legislation, the courts, the supreme military andfinancial power, and furnished it with a sort of body-guardin the liberated slaves and with a sort of army in the settledmilitary colonists. Lastly, when the work was finished, thecreator gave way to his own creation; the absolute autocratbecame voluntarily once more a simple senator. In all thislong military and political career Sulla never lost a battle,was never compelled to retrace a single step, and, ledastray neither by friends nor by foes, brought his work to thegoal which he had himself proposed. He had reason, indeed,to thank his star. The capricious goddess of fortune seemed

ago the state of the climate was probably somewhat less un­favourable than it is at the present day.* The varioiis tribes,whose wandering impulse led them into these regions, sub­mitted to this ordinance of nature and led (and still tosome extent lead) a wandering pastoral life with their herdsof oxen or still more frequently of horses, changing theirplaces of abode and pasture, and carrying their effectsalong with them in waggon-houses. Their equipment andstyle of fighting were consonant to this mode of life; theinhabitants of these steppes fought in great measure onhorseback and always in loose array, equipped with helmetand coat of mail of leather and leather-covered shield, armedwith sword, lance, and bow—the ancestors of the modernCossacks. The Scythians originally settled there, who seemto have been of Mongolian race and akin in their habits andphysical appearance to the present inhabitants of Siberia,had been followed up by Sarmatian tribes advancing fromeast to west,—Sauromatae, Roxolani, Jazyges,—who arecommonly reckoned of Slavonian descent, although theproper names, which we are entitled to ascribe to them,show more affinity with Median and Persian names andthose peoples perhaps belonged rather to the great Zendstock. Thracian tribes moved in the opposite direction,particularly the Getae, who reached as far as the Dniester.Between the two there intruded themselves—probably asoffsets of the great Germanic migration, the main body ofwhich seems not to have touched the Black Sea—the Celts,as they were called, on the Dnieper, the Bastarnee in thesame quarter, and the Peucini at the mouth of the Danube.A state, in the proper sense, was nowhere formed; everytribe lived by itself under its princes and elders.

the Julian law, or the censors of 668, or Sulla, that first 8ti.arranged the details, cannot be determined: the intrustingof the censorial functions to the duumviri seems indeed tohave been introduced after the analogy of the Sullau ordi­nance superseding the censorship, but may be equally wellreferred to the primitive Latin constitution to which thecensorship was unknown. In any case this municipal con­stitution—inserted in, and subordinate to, the state proper—is one of the most remarkable and momentous products ofthe Sullan period, and of the life of the Roman state gene­rally. Antiquity was certainly as little able to dovetail thecity into the state as to develop of itself representative govern­ment and other great principles of our modern state-life;but it carried its political development up to those limits atwhich it outgrows and bursts its assigned dimensions, andthis was the case especially with Rome, which in every re­spect stands on the line of separation between the old andthe new intellectual worlds. In the Sullan constitution thecollective assembly and the urban character of the common­wealth of Rome on the one hand vanished almost into ameaningless form; the community subsisting within thestate on the other hand was completely developed in theItalian munieipium. Down to the name, which in such casesno doubt is the half of the matter, this last constitution ofthe free republic carried out the representative system and theidea of the state resting on the basis of the municipalities.
The municipal system in the provinces was not alteredby this movement; the municipal authorities of the non-freetowns remained, on the contrary, special exceptions apart,confined to administration and police, from which no doubt acertain jurisdiction, over slaves guilty of crimes for example,could not be separated. —-
Such was the constitution which Lucius Cornelius Sulla Impressiongave to the commonwealth of Rome.

Of the armies, the one on which thematter chiefly depended was that of the north, as the greaterpart of the Campanian army was destined to depart for Asia.Sulla got the command of the former intrusted by decree of strabo.the people to his devoted colleague Quintus Rufus, andprocured the recall of the former general Gnaeus Strabo insuch a manner as to spare as far as possible his feelings—the more so, because the latter belonged to the equestrianparty and his passive attitude during the Sulpician troubleshad occasioned no small anxiety to the aristocracy. Rufusarrived at the army and took the chief command in Strabo'sstead; but a few days afterwards he was killed by thesoldiers, and Strabo returned to the command which he hadhardly abdicated. He was regarded as the instigator of themurder; it is certain that he was a man from whom such adeed might be expected, that he reaped the fruits of thecrime, aud that he punished the well-known perpetrators of itonly with words. The removal of Rufus and the commander-ship of Strabo formed a new and serious danger for Sulla; yethe did nothing to deprive the latter of his command. Soonafterwards, when his consulship expired, he found himselfon the one hand pressed by his successor Cinna to departat length for Asia where his presence was certainly urgentlyneeded, and on the other hand cited by one of the newtribunes before the bar of the people; it was clear to thedullest eye, that a new attack on him and his party was inpreparation, and that his opponents wished his removal.Sulla had no alternative save either to push the matter to abreach with Cinna. and perhaps with Strabo and once moreto march on Rome, or to leave Italian affairs to take theircourse and to remove to another continent.

The morbid matterhad been long in existence, but it needed the sun of pros­perity to develop it. There was a profound meaning inthe question of Cato, "What was to become of Rome, whenshe should no longer have any state to fear p" That pointhad now been reached. Every neighbour whom she mighthave feared was politically annihilated; and of the men, whohad been reared under the old order of things in the severeschool of the Hannibalic war, and whose words still soundedas echoes of that mighty epoch so long as they survived,death called one after another away, till at length the voiceof the last of them, the veteran Cato, ceased to be heard inthe senate-house and in the Forum. A younger generationcame to the helm, and their policy was a sorry answer to thatquestion of the veteran patriot. We have already spoken ofthe shape which the government of the subjects and theexternal policy of Rome assumed in their hands. In in­ternal affairs they were, if possible, still more disposed tolet the ship drive before the wind: if we understand by in-ternal government more than the transaction of current busi­ness, there was at this period no government in Bome at all.The single leading thought of the governing corporationwas the maintenance and, if possible, the increase of theirusurped privileges. It was not the state that had a title toget the right and the best man for its supreme magistracy;but every member of the coterie had an inborn title to thehighest office of the state—a title not to be prejudiced bythe unfair rivalry of his peers or by the encroachments ofthe excluded.

There he attacked the other Roman corps under Lupusunexpectedly during the crossing, and partly cut it down,90. partly drove it into the river (11th June 664). The consulDefeat and in person and 8000 of his troops fell. It could scarcely becalled a compensation, that Marius, becoming at lengthaware of Scato's departure, had crossed the river and notwithout loss to the enemy occupied their camp. Yet thispassage of the river, and a victory at the same time obtainedover the Paelignians by the general Servius Sulpicius, com­pelled the Marsians to draw their line of defence somewhatback, and Marius, who by decree of the senate succeededLupus as commander-in-chief, at least prevented the enemyfrom gaining further successes. But, when Quintus Caepiowas soon afterwards associated in the command with equalpowers, not so much on account of a conflict which he hadsuccessfully sustained, as because he had recommended him­self to the equites then leading the politics of Rome by hisvehement opposition to Drusus, he allowed himself to be luredinto an ambush by Silo on the pretext that the latter wishedto betray to him his army, and was cut to pieces with a greatpart of his force by the Marsians and Vestinians. Marius,after Caepio's fall once more sole commander-in-chief, throughhis obstinate resistance prevented his antagonist from profit­ing by the advantages which he had gained, and graduallypenetrated far into the Marsian territory. He long refusedbattle; when he at length gave it, he vanquished his im­petuous opponent, who left on the battle-field among otherdead Herius Asinius the chieftain of the Marruciui. In asecond engagement the army of Marius and the corps ofSulla which belonged to the army of the south co-operatedto inflict on the Marsians a still more considerable defeat,which cost them 6000 men; but the glory of the day re­mained with the younger officer, for, while Marius had givenand gained the battle, Sulla had intercepted the retreat ofthe fugitives and destroyed them.
While the conflict was proceeding thus warmly and withvarying success by the Fucine lake, the Picenian corps underStrabo had also fought with alternations of fortune. Theinsurgent chiefs, Gaius Judacilius from Asculum, PubliusVettius Scato, and Titus Lafrenius had assailed it with theirunited forces, defeated it, and compelled it to throw itselfinto Firmum, where Lafrenius kept Strabo besieged, whileJudacilius moved into Apulia and induced Canusium, Venu-

In Egypt notonly was the restoration of Philometor accomplished, but—partly in order to put an end to the quarrel between thebrothers, partly in order to weaken the still considerablepower of Egypt—Cyrene was separated from that kingdomand assigned as an appanage to Euergetes. "The Romansmake kings of those whom they choose," a Jew wrote not longafter this, " and whom they do not choose they drive awayfrom their country and their people." But this was thelast occasion for long, on which the Boman senate came for­ward in the affairs of the East with that ability and energywhich it had uniformly displayed in the complications withPhilip, Antiochus, and Perseus. Though the internal declineof the government was late in affecting the treatment offoreign affairs, yet it did affect them at length. Thegovernment became unsteady and vacillating; they allowedthe reins which they had just grasped to slacken and almostto slip from their hands. The guardian-regent of Syriawas murdered at Laodicea; the rejected pretender Deme­trius escaped from Rome and, setting aside the youthfulprince, seized the government of his ancestral kingdomunder the bold pretext that the Roman senate had fullyempowered him to do so (592). Soon afterwards war 162.broke out between the kings of Egypt and Cyrene respect­ing the possession of the island of Cyprus, which the senatehad assigned first to the elder, then to the younger; andin opposition to the most recent Roman decision it finallyremained with Egypt. Thus the decrees of the Romangovernment, in the plenitude of its power and duringthe most profound inward and outward peace at home,were derided by the impotent kings of the East; its namewas abused, its ward and its commissioner were mur­dered. Seventy years before, when the Illyrians had in asimilar way laid hands on Eoman deputies, the senate ofthat day had erected a monument to the murdered inthe market-place, and had with an army and fleet calledthe murderers to account. The senate of this period like­wise ordered a monument to be raised to Gnaeus Octavius,as ancestral custom prescribed; but instead of embarkingtroops for Syria they recognized Demetrius as king ofthe land.

Greece proper had greater occasion than Macedonia to
congratulate herself on the favour of the ruling power;and the Philhellenes of Rome were probably of opinionthat the calamitous effects of the war with Perseus weredisappearing, and that the state of things in general was im­proving there. The bitterest abettors of the now dominantparty, Lyciscus the iEtolian, Mnasippus the Boeotian, Chre-matas the Acarnanian, the infamous Epirot Charops whomhonourable Romans forbade even to enter their houses, de­scended one after another to the grave; another generationgrew up, in which the old recollections and the old antago­nisms had faded. The senate thought that the time for general150. forgiveness and oblivion had come, and in 604 released thesurvivors of those Achaean patriots who had been confinedfor seventeen years in Italy, and whose liberation theAchaean diet had never ceased to demand. Neverthelessthey were mistaken. How little the Romans with all theirPhilhellenism had been successful in really harmonizing Hel­lenic patriotism, was nowhere more clearly apparent than inthe attitude of the Greeks towards the Attalids. KingEumenes II. was, as a friend of the Romans, extremelyhated in Greece (ii. 291); but scarcely had a coldness arisenbetween him and the Romans, when he became suddenlypopular in Greece, and the Hellenic votary of hope expectedthe deliverer from a foreign yoke to come now from Perga-mus as formerly from Macedon. Social disorganization moreespecially was visibly on the increase among the petty statesof Hellas now left to themselves. The country becamedesolate not through war and pestilence, but through thedaily increasing disinclination of the higher classes to troublethemselves with wife and children; on the other hand thecriminal or the thoughtless flocked as hitherto chiefly toGreece, to await the recruiting officer there.

The Syrian state embraced at the most Mesopo­tamia in addition to the region of the coast, and disappeared,more in consequence of its internal disorganization than ofits diminished size, for ever from the ranks of the greatstates. If the danger—which was repeatedly imminent—ofa total subjugation of the land by the Parthians wasaverted, that result must be ascribed not to the resistance ofthe last Seleucidae and still less to the influence of Rome,but rather to the manifold internal disturbances in theParthian empire itself, and above all to the incursions ofthe peoples of the Turanian steppes into its eastern pro­vinces.Reaction of ^is revolution in the relations of the peoples in thethe East interior of Asia is the turning-point in the history of anti-against the quity. The tide of national movement, which had hithertoWest- poured from the west to the east and had found in Alex­

On the establishment of the Parthian statenot only were such Hellenic elements as may still perhapshave been preserved in Bactria and along the Indus lost,but western Iran also relapsed into the track which hadbeen abandoned for centuries but still was not yet oblite­rated. The Roman senate sacrificed the first essential resultof the policy of Alexander, and thereby paved the way forthat retrograde movement, whose last offshoots ended inthe Alhambra of Granada and in the great Mosque of Con­stantinople. So long as the country from Ragae andPersepolis to the Mediterranean obeyed the king ofAntioch, the power of Rome extended to the border of thegreat desert; the Parthian state could never take its placeamong the dependencies of the Mediterranean empire, notbecause it was so very powerful, but because it bad itscentre far from the coast in the interior of Asia.

* The question whether Greece did or did not become a Roman province in146. 608, virtually runs into a dispute about words. It is certain that the Greekcommunities throughout remained " free" (C. I. Gr. 1543, 15; Caesar, B. C.iii. 4 ; Appian, Mithr. 58: Zonar. ix. 31). But it is no less certain that Greecewas then " taken possession of' by the Romans (Tac. Ann. xiv. 21: 1 Maccab.viii. 9, 10); that thenceforth each community paid a tixed tribute to them (Pau-san. vii. 16, 6, comp. Cic. Be Prov. Cons. 3, 5), the little island of Gyarus, forinstance, paying 150 drachma annually (Strabo, x. 485) ; that the''rods andaxes" of the Roman governor thenceforth ruled in Greece (Polyb. xxxviii. 1 c,comp. Cic. Verr. I. I. 21, 55), and that he thenceforth exercised the superin­tendence over the constitutions of the cities (C. /. Gr. 1543), as well as incertain cases the criminal jurisdiction (C. T. Gr. 1543; Plut. Cim. 2), just asthe senate had hitherto done; and that, lastly, the Macedonian provincialera was also in use in Greece. Between these facts there is no inconsistency,or at any rate none further than is involved in the position of the free citiesgenerally, which are spoken of sometimes as if excluded from the province(e.g. Sueton. Cirs.i 25; Colum. xi. 3, 26), sometimes as assigned to it (e.g.Joseph. Ant. Jud. xiv. 4, 4). The Roman domanial possessions in Greecewere, no doubt, restricted to the territory of Corinth and possibly some por­tions of Kuboea (C. I. Gr. 5879), and there were no subjects in the strict sensethere at all; yet if we look to the relations practically subsisting between theGreek communities and the Macedonian governor, Greece may be reckoned asincluded in the province of Macedonia in the same manner as Massilia in theprovince of Xarbo or Dyrrachium in that of Macedon. We find even cases that89. go much further: Cisalpine Gaul consisted after 665 of mere burgess or Latincommunities and was yet made a province by Sulla, and in the time of Caesar wemeet with regions which consisted exclusively of burgess-communities and yetby no means ceased to be provinces. In these cases the fundamental idea ofthe Roman provincia comes out very clearly; it was primarily nothing buta " command," and all the administrative and judicial functions of the com­mandant were originally collateral duties and corollaries of his military position.On the other hand, if we look to the formal sovereignty of the free communi­ties, it must be granted that the position of Greece was not altered in point of140. constitutional law by the events of 608. It was a difference de facto ratherthan de jure, when instead of the Achaean league the individual communities ofAchaia now appeared by the side of Rome as tributary protected states, andwhen, after the erection of Macedonia as a distinct Roman province, the latterrelieved the authorities of the capital of the superintendence over the Greekciient-states. Greece therefore may or may not be regarded as a part of the"command" of Macedonia, according as the practical or the formal point ofview preponderates; but the former is justly reckoned as the more important.

placed on an essentially different basis. As the constitutiontad hitherto stood, men entered the senate either through thesummons of the censors, which was the proper and ordinaryway, or through the holding of one of the three curule magis­tracies—the consulship, the praitorship, or the aedileship—towhich since the passing of the Ovinian law a seat and votein the senate had been de jure attached (ii. 317). The holdingof an inferior magistracy, of the tribunate or the quaestor-ship, gave probably a claim de facto to a place in the senate—inasmuch as the censorial selection especially turned towardsthe men who had held such offices—but by no means a re­version de jure. Of these two modes of admission, Sullaabolished the former by setting aside—at least practically—the censorship, and altered the latter to the effect that theright of admission to the senate was attached to the quaestor-ship instead of the aedileship, and at the same time the numberof quaestors to be annually nominated was raised to twenty.*The prerogative hitherto legally pertaining to the censors,although practically no longer exercised in its originalserious import—of deleting any senator from the roll, with astatement of the reasons for doing so, at the revisals whichtook place every five years (ii. 318)—likewise fell into abey­ance for the future; the irremoveable character which hadhitherto practically belonged to the senators was thus finallyfixed by Sulla. The total number of senators, which hithertohad probably not much exceeded the old normal number of300 and often perhaps had not even reached it, was by thesemeans considerably augmented, perhaps on an average

* How many quaestors had been hitherto chosen annually, is not known.After 487 there were eight of them—two urban, two military, and fournaval, quaestors (i. 429, 439). To these there fell to be added the quaestorsemployed in the provinces (ii. 67). For the naval quaestors at Ostia, Cales,and so forth were by no means discontinued, and the military quaestors couldnot be employed elsewhere, since in that case the consul, when he appearedas commander-in-chief, would have been without a quaestor. . Now, as downto Sulla's time there were nine provinces, and moreover two qnaestors weresent to Sicily, he may possibly have found as many as eighteen quaestors inexistence. But as the number of the supreme magistrates of this periodwas considerably less than that of their functions (P. 366), and the diffi.culty thus arising was constantly remedied by extension of the term ofoffice and other expedients, and as generally the tendency of the Romangovernment was to limit as much as possible the number of magistrates, theremay have been more quaestorial functions than quaestors, and it may bo eventhat at this period no quaestor at all was sent to small provinces such asCilicia. Certainly however there were, already before Sulla's time, more thaneight quaestors.

decumanus, and every child of free parents seemed born forthe Roman slave-drivers. It is true that the Asiatic boreeven this torture with his inexhaustible passive endurance;but it was not patience and reflection that made him bearit peacefully. It was rather the peculiarly Oriental want ofpower to take the initiative; and in these peaceful lands,amidst these effeminate nations, strange and terrible thingsmight happen, if once there should appear among thema man who knew how to give the signal for revolt.
There reigned at that time in the kingdom of Pontus MithradatesMithradates VI. surnamed Eupator (born about 624, + E"Pat01.-.,691) who traced back his lineage on the father's side in thesixteenth generation to king Darius the son of Hystaspesand in the eighth to Mithradates I. the founder of thePontic empire, and was on the mother's side descended fromthe Alexandridae and the Seleucidae. After the early deathof his father Mithradates Euergetes, who fell by the hand ofan assassin at Sinope, he had received the title of king about634, when a boy of eleven years of age; but the diadem 120.brought to him only trouble and danger. His guardians,and even as it would seem his own mother called to takea part in the government by his father's will, conspiredagainst the boy-king's life. It is said that, in order to escapefrom the daggers of his legal protectors, he became of hisown accord a wanderer, and during seven years, changinghis resting-place night after night, a fugitive in his own
. kingdom, led the life of a homeless hunter. Thus the boy
'grew into a mighty man. Although our accounts regardinghim are in substance traceable to written records of contem­poraries, yet the legendary tradition which is generatedwith the rapidity of lightning in the East early adornedthe mighty king with many of the traits of its Samson andRustem. These traits, however, belong to his characterjust as the crown of clouds belongs to the character of thehighest mountain-peaks; the outline of the figure appearsin both cases only more coloured and fantastic, not dis­turbed or essentially altered. The armour, which fitted thegigantic frame of king Mithradates, excited the wonder ofthe Asiatics and still more that of the Italians. As a runnerhe overtook the swiftest deer; as a rider he broke in the
wild steed, and was able by changing horses to- accomplish120 miles in a day; as a charioteer he drove with sixteen in

When we read, for instance, in Piso that Romulusavoided indulging in his cups when he had a sitting of thesenate next day; or that Tarpeia betrayed the Capitol tothe Sabines out of patriotism, with a view to deprive theenemy of their shields; we cannot be surprised at the judg­ment of intelligent contemporaries as to all this sort ofscribbling, "that it was not writing history, but tellingstories to children." Of far greater excellence were isolatedworks on the history of the recent past and of the present,particularly the history of the Hannibalic war by Lucius121. Caelius Antipater (about 633) and the history of his owntime by Publius Sempronius Asellio, who was a little younger.These exhibited at least valuable materials and an earnestspirit of truth, in the case of Antipater also a vigorous,although somewhat homely, style of narrative; yet, judging• from all testimonies and fragments, none of these bookscame up either in pithy form or in originality to the"Origines " of Cato, who unhappily created as little of aschool in the field of history as in that of politics.Memoirs The subordinate, more individual and ephemeral, species
and of historical literature—memoirs, letters, and speeches,—

The first statesmen of Rome already recorded inperson their experiences: such as Marcus Scaurus (consul115. 105. in 639), Publius Rufus (consul in 649), Quintus Catulus102- (consul in 652), and even the regent Sulla; but none of theseproductions seem to have been of importance for literatureotherwise than by the substance of their contents. Thecollection of letters of Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi,was remarkable partly for the classical purity of the lan­guage and the high spirit of the writer, partly as the firstcorrespondence published in Rome, and as the first literaryproduction of a Roman lady. The literature of speechespreserved at this period the stamp impressed on it by Cato;advocates' pleadings were not yet looked on as literaryproductions, and such speeches as were published werepolitical pamphlets.

The periodand circumstances in which this spear-court, which hadjurisdiction in processes as to Roman inheritance, originated,are involved in obscurity; but they must, it may be presumed,have been nearly the same as in the case of the essentiallysimilar criminal commissions mentioned above. As to thepresidency of these different tribunals there were differentregulations in the respective ordinances appointing them:thus there presided over the tribunal as to exactions a praetor,over the assassination-court a president specially nominatedfrom those who had been aediles, over the spear-court severaldirectors taken from the former quaestors. The jurymen bothfor the ordinary and for the extraordinary procedure were, inaccordance with the Gracchan arrangement, taken from thenon-senatorial men of equestrian census: in the case of thespear-court alone three jurymen were nominated by freeelection from each of the thirty-five tribes, and the courtwas composed of these hundred and five men.Sullan Sulla's leading reforms were of a threefold character.
Quwdiaaes. First, he very considerably increased the number of thejury-courts. There were henceforth separate judicial com­missions for exactions; for murder, including arson andperjury; for bribery at elections; for high treason andany dishonour done to the Roman name; for adultery;for the most heinous cases of fraud—the forging of willsand of money; for the most heinous violations of honour,particularly for injuries to the person and disturbance of thedomestic peace; perhaps also for embezzlement of publicmoneys, for usury and other crimes; and for each of theseold or new tribunals Sulla issued a special ordinance set­ting forth the crime and form of criminal procedure. Theauthorities, moreover, were not deprived of the right toappoint in case of emergency special courts for specialgroups of crimes.

Lucilius' Poems, first to a select circle, and then in publicon set days and in presence of a great concourse, andoccasionally also to treat them critically after the precedentof the Homeric grammarians. These literary prelections,which cultivated dilettanti (Ktterati) held gratuitously, -werenot formally a part of juvenile instruction, but were yet anessential means of introducing the youth to the under­standing and the delivery of the classic Latin literature.
The formation of Latin oratory took place in a similarway. The noble Roman youth, who were even at an earlyage instigated to come forward in public with panegyricsand forensic speeches, can never have wanted exercises inoratory ; but it was ouly at this epoch, and in consequence ofthe new exclusive culture, that there arose rhetoric properlyso called. Marcus Lepidus Porcina (consul in 617) is men­tioned as the first Roman advocate, who technically handledthe language and subject-matter; the two famous advocatesof the Marian age, the masculine and vigorous Marcus Anto-nius (611-667) and the elegant and chaste orator LuciusCrassus (614-663) were already complete rhetoricians.The exercises of the young men in speaking increasednaturally in extent and importance, but still remained, justlike the exercises in Latin literature, essentially limited tothe personal attendance of the beginner on the master of theart so as to be trained by his example and his instructions.
Formal instruction both in Latin literature and in Latinrhetoric was given first about 650 by Lucius iElius Prs^coninus of Lanuvium, called the " penman" (Stilo), a distin­guished Roman knight of strict conservative views, who readPlantus and similar works with a select circle of youngermen—including Varro and Cicero—and sometimes also wentover outlines of speeches with the authors, or put similaroutlines into the hands of his friends. This was a realinstruction. Stilo however was not a professional school­master, but he taught literature and rhetoric, just as juris­prudence was taught at Rome, in the character of a seniorfriend of aspiring young men, not of a man hiring out brsservices and at every one's command.
But about his time began also the scholastic higherinstruction in Latin, separated both from elementary Latinand from Greek instruction, and imparted in special esta­blishments by paid masters, ordinarily manumitted slaves.That its spirit and method were throughout borrowed from

It opened up forthe Italian proletariate a permanent outlet, and a relief infact more than provisional; but it certainly abandoned theprinciple of state-law hitherto in force, by which Italy wasregarded exclusively as the governing, and the provincialterritory exclusively as the governed, land.
To these measures having immediate reference to the Modifica-great question of the proletariate there was added a series tions of tlleof enactments, which arose out of the general tendency to I* •
introduce principles milder and more accordant with thespirit of the age than the antiquated severity of the existingconstitution. To this head belong the modifications in themilitary system. As to the length of the period of servicethere existed under the ancient law no other limit, ex­cept that no citizen was liable to ordinary service in thefield before completing his sixteenth or after completinghis forty-sixth year. When, in consequence of the occu­pation of Spain, the service began to become permanent (ii.'210), it seems to have been first legally enacted, that any onewho had been in the field for six successive years acquiredthereby a right to discharge, although this discharge didnot protect him from being called out again afterwards. Ata later period, perhaps about the beginning of this century,the rule arose, that a service of twenty years in theinfantry or ten years in the cavalry gave exemption fromfurther military service.* Gracchus renewed the rule—which was often, in all probability, violently infringed—that no citizen should be enlisted in the army before thecommencement of his seventeenth year; and also, appa­rently, restricted the number of campaigns requisite forfull exemption from military duty. Besides, the clothingof the soldiers, the value of which had hitherto been de­ducted from their pay, was henceforward furnished gratui­tously by the state.
To this head belongs, moreover, the tendency which is on


* Thus the statement of Appian (ffisp. 78) that six years' service entitleda man to demand hrs discharge, may perhaps be reconciled with the betterknown statement of Polybius (vi. 19), respecting which Marquardt [Alterth.iii. 2, 286 A. 1580) has formed a correct judgment. The time, at which thetwo alterations were introduced, cannot be deteimined further than that thetii-stwas probably in existence as early as 603 (Nitzsch, Gracchen, p. 231), andthe second certainly as early as the time of Polybius. That Gracchus re­duced the number of the legal years of service, seems to follow from Asconiusm Cornel, p. 68; comp. Plutarch, Ti. Graoch. 16; Dio. Fr. 83, 7, Bekk.

It is probable that the introduction of the systemof inland enlistment byMarius saved the state in a militarypoint of view from destruction, just as several centuriesafterwards Arbogast and Stilicho prolonged its existence fora time by the introduction of foreign enlistment. Never­theless, it involved a complete—although not yet developed—political revolution. The republican constitution was essen­tially based on the view that the citizen was also soldier, andthat the soldier was above all a citizen; it was at an end, sosoon as a soldier-class was formed. To this issue the newsystem of drill, with its routine borrowed from the profes­sional gladiator, necessarily led; the military service becamegradually a profession. Far more rapid was the effect of theadmission—though but limited—of the proletariate to par­ticipate in military service; especially in connection withthe primitive maxims, which conceded to the general anarbitrary right of rewarding his soldiers compatible onlywith very solid republican institutions, and gave to the ableand successful soldier a sort of title to demand from thegeneral a share of the moveable spoil and from the state aportion of the soil that had been won. While the burgess orfarmer called out under the levy saw in military servicenothing but a burden to be undertaken for the public good,and in the gains of war nothing but a slight compensationfor the far.more considerable loss brought upon him by serv­ing, it was otherwise with the enlisted proletarian. Not onlywas he for the moment solely dependent upon his pay, but,as there was no Hotel des Invalides nor even a poorhouse toreceive him after his discharge, he necessarily desired forthe future also to abide by his standard, and not to leave itotherwise than with the establishment of his civic status.His only home was the camp, his only science war, his onlyhope the general—what this implied, is clear. When Mariusafter the engagement on the Eaudine plain unconstitution­ally gave Roman citizenship on the very field of battle to twocohorts of Italian allies in a body for their brave conduct,he justified himself afterwards by saying that amidst thenoise of battle he had not been able to distinguish the voiceof the laws.

Italy as well as in Rome, from which the insurrection hadoriginated, and which now, when the half of Italy was underarms, appeared to the whole of the indignant and alarmedburgesses undoubted treason. The sentences of this com­mission greatly thinned the ranks of the senatorial partyfavourable to mediation; among other men of note Drusus'intimate friend, the young and talented Gaius Cotta, wassent into banishment, and with difficulty the grey-hairedMarcus Scaurus escaped the same fate.

Party feuds were silent; able officers of all shades—democrats like Gaius Marius, aristocrats like Lucius Sulla,friends of Drusus like Publius Sulpicius Rufus—placed them­selves at the disposal of the government. The largesses ofcorn were, apparently about this time, materially abridgedby decree of the people with a view to husband the financialresources of the state for the war; which was the morenecessary, as, owing to the threatening attitude of king Mith­radates, the province of Asia might at any moment fall intothe hand of the enemy and thus one of the chief sources ofthe Roman revenue be dried up. The courts, with the ex­ception of the commission of high treason, in accordancewith a decree of the senate temporarily suspended theiraction ; all business stood still, and nothing was attended tobut the levying of soldiers and the manufacture of arms.

Position of The position of the Roman government began to be criti-the Romans. cal, Asia Minor and Hellas were wholly, Macedonia to aconsiderable extent, in the enemy's hands; by sea the Pon­tic flag ruled without a rival. Then there was the Italianinsurrection, which though baffled on the whole, still heldthe undisputed command of wide districts of Italy; thebarely hushed-up revolution, which threatened every momentto break out afresh and more formidably; and, lastly, thealarming commercial and monetary crisis (P. 258) occasionedby the internal troubles of Italy and the enormous losses ofthe Asiatic capitalists, and the want of trustworthy troops.The government would have required three armies, to keepdown the revolution in Rome, to crush completely the insur­rection in Italy, and to wage war in Asia; it had but one,that of Sulla; for the northern army was, under the untrust­worthy Gnaeus Strabo, simply an additional embarrassment.Sulla had to choose which of these three tasks he would un­dertake; he decided, as we have seen, for the Asiatic war. Itwas no trifling matter—we should perhaps say, it was a greatact of patriotism—that in this conflict between the generalinterest of his country and the special interest of his partythe former retained the ascendancy; and that Sulla, inspite of the dangers which his removal from Italy involvedfor his constitution and his party, landed in the spring of

made himself a name by his impetuous popular eloquence,and above all Quintus Sertorius, one of the most talented ofBoman officers and a man in every respect excellent, whosince his candidature for the tribuneship had been a personalenemy to Sulla and had been led by this quarrel into theranks of the disaffected to which he did not at all by naturebelong. The proconsul Strabo, although at variance withthe government, was yet far from going along with thisfaction.
So long as Sulla was in Italy, the confederates for goodreasons remained quiet. But when the dreaded proconsul,yielding not to the exhortations of the consul Cinna but tothe urgent state of matters in the East, had embarked,Cinna, supported by the majority of the college of tribunes,immediately submitted the projects of law which had beenconcerted as a partial reaction against the Sullan restorationof 666. They embraced the political equalization of the newburgesses and the freedmen, as Sulpicius had proposed it, andthe restitution of those who had been banished in conse­quence of the Sulpician revolution to their former status.The new burgesses flocked en masse to the capital, thatalong with the freedmen they might terrify, and in case ofneed force, their opponents into compliance. But thegovernment party was determined not to yield; consulstood against consul, Gnaeus Octavius against Lucius Cinna,and tribune against tribune; the majority on both sidesappeared in arms on the day of voting. The tribunes ofthe senatorial party interposed their veto; when swordswere drawn against them even on the rostra, Octavius em­ployed force against force. His compact bands of armedmen not only cleared the Via Sacra and the Forum, butalso, disregarding the commands of their more gently-minded leader, exercised horrible atrocities against theassembled multitude. The Forum swam with blood on this"Octavius' day," as it never did before or afterwards—thenumber of corpses was estimated at ten thousand. Cinnacalled on the slaves to purchase freedom for themselves bysharing in the struggle; but his appeal was as unsuccessfulas the like appeal of Marius in the previous year, and nocourse was left to the leaders of the movement but to takeflight.

electors appeared to every unprejudiced person ridiculous; butall these restrictions were dangerous, inasmuch as they in­vited every demagogue to carry his ulterior objects by takingup the more or less just demands of the new burgesses and ofthe Italians excluded from the franchise. While accordingly Secondarythe more clear-seeing of the aristocracy could not but find effect of thethese partial and grudging concessions as inadequate as did P°liticalthe new burgesses and the excluded themselves, they further t^011"painfully felt the absence from their ranks of the numerousand excellent men whom the Yarian commission of high-treason had exiled, and whom it was the more difficult torecall because they had been condemned by the verdict notof the people but of the judices; for, while there was littlehesitation as to cancelling a decree of the people even of ajudicial character by means of a second, the cancelling of averdict of jurymen by the people appeared to the better por­tion of the aristocracy as a very dangerous precedent. Thusneither the ultras nor the moderates were content with theissue of the Italian crisis. But still deeper indignation Marius.swelled the heart of the old man, who had gone forth to theItalian war with revived hopes and had come back from itreluctantly, with the consciousness of having rendered newservices and of having received in return new and most severemortifications, with the bitter feeling of being no longerdreaded but despised by his enemies, with that gnawing spiritof vengeance in his heart, which feeds on its own poison. Itwas true of him also, as of the new burgesses and theexcluded; incapable and awkward as he had shown himselfto be, his popular name was still a formidable weapon in thehand of a demagogue.
With these elements of political convulsion was combined Decay ofthe rapidly spreading decay of the honourable old soldierly militaryspirit and of military discipline. The seeds, which were discipline.sown by the enrolment of the proletariate in the army,developed themselves with alarming rapidity during the de­moralizing insurrectionary war, which compelled Rome toadmit to the service every man capable of bearing armswithout distinction, and which above all carried politicalpartizanship directly into the headquarters and into thesoldiers' tent.

Declaration The Romans, who had carefully abstained from preventingof war by the war itself by seasonable interposition, had now what theyme# wished; namely, a serviceable pretext for war—for the Car­thaginians had certainly now transgressed the stipulations ofthe treaty, that they should not wage war against the alliesof Rome, or beyond their own bounds (ii. 187, 200)—and anantagonist already beaten beforehand. The Italian contin­gents were summoned to Rome, and the ships wereassembled; the declaration of war might issue at anymoment. The Carthaginians made every effort to avert theimpending blow. Hasdrubal and Carthalo, the leaders ofthe patriot party, were condemned to death, and an embassywas sent to Rome to throw the responsibility on them. Butat the same time envoys from TTtica, the second city of theLibyan. Phoenicians, arrived there with full powers to sur­render their community wholly to the Romans; comparedwith such obliging submissiveness, it seemed almost aninsolence that the Carthaginians had rested content withordering, unbidden, the execution of their most eminentmen. The senate declared that the excuse of the Cartha­ginians was found insufficient; to the question, what in thatcase would suffice, the reply was given that the Cartha­ginians knew that themselves. They might, no doubt, haveknown what the Romans wished; but yet it seemed inopossible to believe, that the last hour of their loved native cityhad really come. Once more Carthaginian envoys—onthis occasion thirty in number and with unlimited powers-were sent to Rome. When they arrived, war was already149. declared (beginning of 605), and the double consular armyhad embarked. Yet they even now attempted to dispel thestorm by complete submission.

At the great slave-market at Delos and inthe Attic silver-mines about the same period the revoltedslaves had to be put down by force of arms. The waragainst Aristonicus and his "Heliopolites" in Asia Minorwas in substance a war of the landholders against therevolted slaves (P. 55). But worst of all, of course, was The firstthe condition of Sicily, the chosen land of the plantation Siciliansystem. Brigandage had long been a standing evil there,slare war-especially in the interior; it began to swell into insurrec­tion. Damophilus, a wealthy planter of Euna (Castro-giovanni), who emulated the Italian lords in the indus­trial investment of his living capital, was attacked andmurdered by his exasperated rural slaves; whereupon thesavage band flocked into the town of Enna, and thererepeated the same process on a greater scale.

Itwas only towards winter that Scipio drew together his armyround Numantia. Besides the Numidian contingent ofhorsemen, infantry, and twelve elephants led by the princeJugurtha, and the numerous Spanish contingents, therewere four legions, in all a force of 60,000 men investing acity whose citizens capable of arms were not more at mostthan 8000. Nevertheless the besieged frequently offeredbattle; but Scipio, perceiving clearly that the disorganiza­tion of many years was not to be repaired all at once,refused to accept it, and, when conflicts did occur in con­nection with the sallies of the besieged, the cowardly flightof \he legionaries, checked with difficulty by the appearanceof the general in person, justified such tactics only tooforcibly. Never did a general treat his soldiers more con­temptuously that Scipio treated the Numantine army; andhe showed his opinion of it not only by bitter speeches, butabove all by the course of action which he adopted. Forthe first time the Romans waged war by means of mattock'and spade, where it depended on themselves alone whetherthey should use the sword. Around the whole circuit ofthe city, which was nearly three miles, there was constructeda double line of circumvallation of twice that extent, providedwith walls, towers, and ditches; and the river Douro, by whichat first some supplies had reached the besieged through theefforts of bold boatmen and divers, was at length closed.Thus in all probability the town, whieh they did notventure to assault, could not fail to be reduced throughfamine; the more so, as it had not been possible for thecitizens to lay in provisions during the last summer. TheNumantines soon suffered from want of everything. One oftheir boldest men, Retogenes, cut his way with a few com­panions through the enemy's lines, and his touching entreatythat kinsmen should not be allowed to perish without helpproduced a great effect in Lutia at least, one of the towns ofthe Arevacae.

Lastly the declaration of Drusus, thathe would have nothing to do with the execution of his law,was so dreadfully prudent, that it was almost the height ofabsurdity. But the clumsy snare was quite suited for thestupid game which they wished to catch. There was theadditional and perhaps decisive consideration, that Gracchus,on whose personal influence everything depended, was justthen establishing the Carthaginian colony in Africa, and thathis lieutenant in the capital, Marcus Flaccus, played intothe hands of his opponents by his vehemence and incapacity.The "people " accordingly ratified the Livian laws as readilyas it had before ratified the Sempronian.

Thus the foundation of his despotism gave waybeneath him. A second blow was inflicted, on him by theconsular elections, which not only proved in a general senseadverse to the democracy, but which placed at the head125. of the state Lucius Opimius, who as praetor in 629 hadconquered Fregellae, one of the most decided and leastscrupulous chiefs of the strict aristocratic party, and a manfirmly resolved to get rid of their dangerous antagonist at'the earliest opportunity.Attack on Such an opportunity soon occurred.

when they returned on the third day to give battle, theyfound the Romans in readiness. The conflict came off with­out decisive result; but on their return the Carthaginianvessels so ran foul of each other in and before the entranceof the harbour, that the damage thus occasioned wasequivalent to a defeat. Scipio now directed his attacksagainst the outer quay, which lay outside of the city wallsand was only protected for the exigency by an earthen rampartof recent constructiou. The machines were stationed onthe tongue of land, and a breach was easily made; but withunexampled intrepidity the Carthaginians, wading throughthe shallows, assailed the besieging implements, chased awaythe covering force which ran off in such a manner that Scipiowas obliged to make his own troopers cut them down, anddestroyed the machines. In this way they gained time toclose the breach. Scipio again established the machines andset on fire the wooden towers of the enemy; by which meanshe obtained possession of the quay and of the outer harbouralong with it. A rampart equalling the city wall in heightwas here constructed, and the town was now at length com­pletely blockaded by land and sea, for the inner harbourcould only be reached through the outer. To insure thecompleteness of the blockade, Scipio ordered Gaius Laeliusto attack the camp at Nepheris, where Diogenes now heldthe command; it was captured by a fortunate stratagem,and the whole countless multitude assembled there were putto death or taken prisoners. Winter had now arrived andScipio suspended his operations, leaving famine and pesti­lence to complete what he had begun.

Aquileia (571) the Istrian peninsula came into possessionof the Romans (ii. 196): in part of Epirus and the formerterritory of the lords of Scodra they had already ruled forDalmatians, some considerable time previously. But nowhere did theirdominion reach into the interior; and even on the coast theyexercised scarcely a nominal sway over the inhospitable dis­trict between Istria and Epirus, which, with its wild seriesof mountain-caldrons broken neither by river-valleys norby coast-plains and arranged like scales one above another,and with its chain of rocky islands stretching along thecoast, separates rather than connects Italy and Greece.Around the town of Delmium clustered the confederacy ofthe Delmatians or Dalmatians, whose manners were roughas their mountains. While the neighbouring peoples hadalready attained a high degree of culture, the Dalmatianswere as yet unacquainted with money, and divided their land,without recognizing any special right of property in it,afresh every eight years among the members of the com­munity. Brigandage and piracy were the only nativetrades. These tribes had in earlier times been in looserelations of dependence on the rulers of Scodra, and hadbeen in consequence chastised by the Roman expeditionsagainst queen Teuta (ii. 74) and Demetrius of Pharos(ii. 76); but on the accession of king Genthius they hadrevolted, and had thus escaped the fate which involvedsouthern Illyria in the fall of the Macedonian empire andrendered it permanently dependent on Rome (ii. 302).The Romans were glad to leave the far from attractiveregion to itself. But the complaints of the Roman lllyrians,particularly of the Daorsi, who dwelt on the Narenta to thesoutli of the Dalmatians, and of the inhabitants of theisland of Issa (Lissa), whose continental stations Tragyrium(Trau) and Epetium (near Spalato) suffered severely fromthe natives, compelled the Roman government to despatchan embassy to the latter, and, on receiving the reply thatthe Dalmatians had neither troubled themselves hithertoabout the Romans nor would do so in future, to send thither156. an army in 598 under the consul Gaius Marcius Figulus.Their sub- He penetrated into Dalmatia, but was again driven backjugation. into the Roman territory.

None of these grounds of ill-humour were such asto furnish any immediate prospect of a fresh violent collisionbetween the parties; they were in great part of an aimlessand temporary nature; but they all fed the general dis­content, and had already, been more or less concerned inproducing the murder of Rufus, the repeated attempts toassassinate Sulla, the issue of the consular and tribunicianelections for 667 partly in favour of the opposition. 87.
The name of the man whom the discontented had sum- Ciniia.moned to the head of the state, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, hadbeen hitherto scarcely heard of, except so far as he haddistinguished himself as an officer in the Social war. Wehave less information regarding Cinna's personal standingand his original designs than regarding those of any otherparty leader in the Soman revolution. The reason is, to allappearance, simply that a man so thoroughly vulgar andguided by the lowest selfishness had from the first no compre­hensive political plans whatever. It was asserted at his veryfirst appearance that he had sold himself for a round sum ofmoney to the new burgesses and the coterie of Marius, andthe charge looks very credible; but even were it false, itremains nevertheless significant that a suspicion of thesort, such, as was never expressed against Saturninus andSulpicius, attached to Cinna. In fact the movement, at thehead of which he put himself, has altogether the appearanceof worthlessness both as to motives and as to aims. It pro­ceeded not so much from a party as from a number of dissatis­fied persons without strictly political aims or notable support,who had mainly undertaken to carry out the recall of theexiles by legal or illegal means. Cinna seems to have beenadmitted into the conspiracy only by an after-thought andmerely because the intrigue, which in consequence ofthe restriction of the tribunician powers needed a consul tobring forward its proposals, saw in him among the consularcandidates for 667 its fittest instrument and so pushed him 87-forward as consul.

ordinary domanial and other revenues, had not been leviedsince the battle of Pydna, so that absolute freedom fromland-tax began to be regarded as a constitutional privilegeof Roman landed property. The royalties of the state,such as the salt monopoly (ii. 329) and the right of coinage,•were not now at least, if ever at all, treated as sources ofincome. The new tax on inheritance (ii. 383) was allowedto fall into abeyance or was perhaps directly abolished.Accordingly the Roman exchequer drew from Italy in­cluding Cisalpine Gaul nothing but the produce of thedomains, particularly of the Campanian territory and of thegold mines in the land of the Celts, and the revenue frommanumissions and from goods imported by sea into theRoman civic territory not for the personal consumption ofthe importer. Both of these may be regarded essentially astaxes on luxury, and they certainly must have been con­siderably augmented by the extension of Roman citizenshipand at the same time of Roman customs-dues to all Italy,probably including Cisalpine Gaul.
In the provinces the Roman state claimed directly, as its Provincialprivate property, the whole domain of the cities destroyed revenues.by martial law and—in those states where the Romangovernment came in room of the former rulers—the landedproperty possessed by the latter. By virtue of this rightthe territories of Leontini, Carthage, and Corinth, the do­manial property of the kings of Macedon, Pergamus, andCyrene, the mines of Spain and Macedonia were regardedas Roman domains; and, in like manner with the territoryof Capua, were lensed by the Roman censors to private con­tractors for a certain proportion of the produce or a fixed sumof money. We have already explained that Gaius Gracchuswent still further, claimed the whole land of the provincesas domain, and in the case of the province of Asia practicallycarried out this principle; inasmuch as he legally justifiedthe decumce, scriptura, and vectigalia levied there on the groundof the state's right of property in the land, pasture, andcoasts of the province, whether these had previously be­longed to the king or to private persons (P. 115, 122).

Sicilywas held for them by the trustworthy governor MarcusPerpenna. Quintus Sertorius had the skill to attach to him­self the provincials in Hither Spain, and to form no incon­siderable army from among the Romans settled in Spain,with which he in the first instance closed the passes of thePyrenees: in this he had given fresh proof that, whereverhe was stationed, he was in his place and amidst the incapa-bles of the revolution was the only man practically useful.In Africa the governor Hadrianus, who followed out thework of revolutionizing too thoroughly and began to giveliberty to the slaves, had been, on occasion of a tumultinstigated by the 'Woman merchants of Utica, attacked inhis official residence and burnt with his attendants (672); 82.nevertheless the province adhered to the revolutionarygovernment, and China's son-in-law, the young and ableGnaeus Domitius Aheuobarbus, was invested with the su­preme command there. Propagandism had even been carriedfrom thence into the client-states, Numidia and Mauretania.Their legitimate rulers, Hiempsal II. son of Gauda, andBogud son of Bocchus, adhered to Sulla; but with the aidof the Cinnans the former had been dethroned by the demo­cratic pretender Hiarbas, and similar feuds agitated theMauretanian kingdom. The consul Carbo who had fledfrom Italy tarried on the island Cossyra (Pantellaria) be­tween Africa and Sicily, at a loss, apparently, whether heshould flee to Egypt or should attempt to renew the strugglein one of the faithful provinces.

volved on the two consuls the collective functions of the su- pratorianpreme magistracy, so there still devolved on them all those function*official duties for which distinct functionaries had not been by ^(on thelaw established. This latter course had been adopted with the s™1Ca°administration of justice in the capital, in which the consulsaccording to a rule inviolably adhered to might not interfere,and with the transmarine provinces then existing—Sicily, Sar­dinia, and the two Spains—in which, while the consul mightno doubt exercise his imperium, he did so only exceptionally.In the ordinary course of things, accordingly, the six fieldsof special jurisdiction—the two judicial appomtments in thecapital and the four transmarine provinces—were appor­tioned among the six praetors, while there devolved on thetwo consuls by virtue of their general powers the ma­nagement of the non-judicial business of the capital andthe military command in the continental possessions.Now as this general authority was doubly provided for, theone consul in reality remained at the disposal of the govern­ment, and in ordinary times accordingly those eight supremeannual magistrates fully, and in fact amply, sufficed. For ex­traordinary cases moreover power was reserved on the onehand to conjoin the non-military functions, and on theother hand to prolong the military powers beyond the term oftheir expiry (prorogare). It was not unusual to commit thetwo judicial offices to the same praetor, and to have the bu­siness of the capital, which in ordinary circumstances had tobe transacted by the consuls, managed by the prcetor urbanus;whereas, as far as possible, the combination of several com­mands in the same hand was judiciously avoided. For thatcase on the contrary a remedy was provided by the rule thatthere was no interregnum in the military imperium, so that, al­though it had its legal term, it yet continued after the arrivalof that term de jure until a successor appeared and relievedhis predecessor of the command; or—which is the samething—the commanding consul or praetor after the expiry ofhis term of office, if a successor did not appear, might con­tinue to act and was bound to do so in the consul's orpraetor's stead. The influence of the senate on this ap­portionment of functions consisted in its having by use andwont the power of either giving effect to the ordinary rule,so that the six praetors allotted among themselves the sixspecial departments and the consuls managed the conti­nental non-judicial business, or prescribing some deviation

As early as 667 his son Ariarathes had startedfrom Macedonia to combat Sulla in Greece proper; onlythe sudden death, which overtook the prince on the marchat the Tisaean promontory in Thessaly, had at that time ledto the abandonment of the expedition. His successor86. Taxiles now appeared (668), driving before him the Romancorps stationed in Thessaly, with an army of, it is said,100,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry at Thermopylae Dro-Evacuation michaates joined him. Archelaus also — compelled, appa­rently, not so much by Sulla's arms as by his master's orders—evacuated the Piraeus first partially and then entirely, andjoined the Pontic main army in Boeotia. Sulla, after havinggiven orders that the Piraeeus with all its greatly admiredfortifications should be destroyed, followed the Pontic army,in the hope of being able to fight a pitched battle before thearrival of Flaccus. In vain Archelaus advised that theyshould avoid such a battle, but should keep the sea and thecoast occupied and the enemy in suspense. Now, just asformerly under Darius and Antiochus, the masses of theOrientals, like animals terrified in the midst of a fire, flungthemselves hastily and blindly into battle; and did so onthis occasion more foolishly than ever, since the Asiaticsmight perhaps have had to wait but a few months in orderto be the spectators of a battle between Sulla and Flaccus.
In the plain of the Cephissus not far from Chaeronea, inMarch 668, the armies niet. Even including the divisiondriven back from Thessaly, which had succeeded in accom­plishing its junction with the Roman main army, and includ­ing the Greek contingents, the Roman army found itselfopposed to a foe three times as strong and particularly to acavalry far superior and from the nature of the field ofbattle very dangerous, against which Sulla found it neces­sary to protect his flanks by digging trenches, while in fronthe caused a chain of palisades to be introduced between hisfirst and second lines for protection against the enemy'swar-chariots. When the war-chariots rolled on to open thebattle, the first line of the Romans withdrew behind thisrow of stakes: the chariots, rebounding from it and scaredby the Roman slingers and archers, threw themselves on theirown line and carried confusion both into the Macedonianphalanx and into the corps of the Italian refugees.

The statement, thatnone of the Achaeans perished but Diaeus and none of theBoeotians but Pytheas, is a rhetorical exaggeration: inChalcis especially sad outrages occurred; but yet on thewhole moderation was observed in the infliction of punish­ment. Mumnrius rejected the proposal to throw down thestatues of Philopoemen, the founder of the Achaean patrioticparty; the fines imposed on the communities were destinednot for the Roman exchequer, but for the injured Greek cities,and were mostly remitted afterwards; and the property ofthose traitors who had parents or children was not sold onpublic account, but handed over to their relatives.

It is true that, as was im­plied in the very introduction of the provincial constitution(ii. 63), the special confederacies, and the Achaean in par­ticular, were as such dissolved; the communities wereisolated; and intercourse between them was hampered bythe rule that no one might acquire landed property simul­taneously in two communities. Moreover, as Hamininushad already attempted (ii. 261), the democratic constitutionsof the towns were altogether set aside, and the governmentin each community was placed in the hands of a councilcomposed of the wealthy. A fixed land-tax to be paid toRome was imposed on each community; and they wereall subordinated to the governor of Macedonia in such amanner, that the latter as supreme military chief exercised asuperintendence over administration and justice, and could,for example, personally assume the decision of the moreimportant criminal processes.

various occasions apparent in the Gracchan legislation, ifnot to abolish, at any rate to restrict, capital punishmentstill further than had been done before—a tendency, whichto some extent made itself felt even in military jurisdiction.From the very introduction of the republic the magistratehad lost the right of inflicting capital punishment on theburgess without consulting the community, except undermartial law (i. 259, 450). As this right of appeal on thepart of the burgess appears soon after the period of theGracchi available even in the camp, and the right of thegeneral to inflict capital punishments appears restricted toallies and subjects, the source of the change is probably tobe sought in the law of Gaius Gracchus de provocations. Theright of the community to inflict or rather to confirm sen­tence of death wan, moreover, indirectly but essentiallylimited by the fact, that Gracchus withdrew the cognizanceof those public crimes which most frequently gave occasionto capital sentences—poisoning and murder generally—from the burgesses,and intrusted it to permanent judicial com­missions. These could not, like the tribunals of the people,be broken up by the intercession of a tribune, and there notonly lay no appeal from them to the community, but theirsentences were as little subject to be annulled by the commu­nity as those of the old institute of civil jurymen. In theburgess-tribunals it had, especially in strictly political pro­cesses, no doubt long been the rule, that the accused remainedat liberty during his trial, and was allowed by surrenderinghis burgess-rights to withdraw from punishment and to savehis life and freedom as well as his property, so far, of course,as no civil claims were made good against the latter. Butpreliminary arrest and complete execution of the sentenceremained in such cases at least legally possible, and werestill sometimes carried into effect even against nobles; for142. instance, Lucius Hostilius Tubulus, praetor in 612, who wascapitally impeached for a heinous crime, was refused theprivilege of exile, arrested, and executed. On the other handthe judicial commissions, which originated out of the formof civil process, could not from the first touch the liberty orlife of the citizen, but at the most could only pronounce sen­tence of exile ; this, which had hitherto been a modification ofpunishment accorded to one who was found guilty, now be­came for the first time a formal penalty.

Rome. The forefathers of the city had based their govern­ment of Italy on an aristocratic classification, and with skilfuladjustment of the degrees of dependence had kept in sub­jection the less privileged communities by means of thosewith better rights, and the burgesses within each commu­nity by means of the municipal aristocracy. It was onlynow, under the incomparably wretched government of theoligarchy, that the solidity and strength with which the states­men of the fourth and fifth centuries had joined together thestones of their structure were thoroughly put to the test;the building, though shaken in various ways, still held outagainst this storm. When we say, however, that the morefavoured towns did not at the first shock abandon Rome,we by no means affirm that they would now, as in the Han-nibalic war, hold out for a length of time and after severedefeats, without wavering in their allegiance to Rome; thatfiery trial had not yet been endured.Impression The first blood was thus shed, and Italy was divided intoas to the two great military camps.

that after several months' warfare there was still on handnearly £600,000 (14,000 pounds of gold and 6000 pounds ofsilver). In the considerable portion of Italy, which stillvoluntarily or under compulsion adhered to the revolution,warlike preparations were prosecuted with vigour. Newly-formed divisions of some strength came from Etruria, wherethe communities of new-burgesses were very numerous, andfrom the region of the Po. The veterans of Marius ingreat numbers ranged themselves under the standards atthe call of his son. But nowhere were preparations madefor the struggle against Sulla with such eagerness as in theinsurgent Samnium and some districts of Lucania. It wasowing to anything but devotion towards the revolutionaryItoman government, that numerous contingents from theOscan districts reinforced their armies; but it was wellunderstood there that an oligarchy restored by Sulla wouldnot acquiesce in the de facto independence of these lands asthe lax Cinnan government had now done; and therefore theprimitive rivalry between the Sabellians and the Latins wasroused afresh in the struggle against Sulla. For Samniumand Latium this war was as much a national struggle as thewars of the fifth century; they strove not for a greater orless amount of political rights, but for the purpose of ap­peasing long-suppressed hate by the annihilation of theirantagonists. It was no wonder therefore, that the war inthis region bore a character altogether different from theconflicts elsewhere, that no compromise was attempted there,that no quarter was given or taken, and that the pursuitwas continued to the very uttermost.
Thus the campaign of 672 was begun on both sides with 82.augmented military resources and increased animosity.The revolution in particular threw away the scabbard: atCarbo's suggestion the Roman comitia outlawed all thesenators that should be found in Sulla's camp.

Nownot only was the provincial land already available claimedin its widest extent for the Romano-Italian emigration, butalso all the land of the still independent Celtic tribes beyondthe Alps, by virtue of the legal fiction, that through theconquest of the Cimbri all the territory occupied by thesehad been acquired de jure by the Romans. Gaius Mariuswas called to conduct the assignations of land and thefurther measures that might appear necessary in this behalf;and the temple-treasures of Tolosa, which had been embez­zled but were refunded or had still to be refunded by theguilty aristocrats, were destined for the new recipients oflands. This law therefore not only revived the plans of con­quest beyond the Alps and the projects of transalpine andtransmarine colonization, which Gains Gracchus and Flaccushad sketched, on the most extensive scale; but, by admittingthe Italians along with the Romans to emigration and yetundoubtedly prescribing the erection of all the new commu­nities as burgess-colonies, it formed a first step towardssatisfying the claims—to which it was so difficult to giveeffect, and which yet could not be in the long run refused—ofthe Italians to be placed on an equality with the Romans.First of all, however, if the law passed and Marius was calledto the independent carrying out of these immense schemes ofconquest and assignation, he would become practicallyfuntilthose plans should be realized or rather, considering theirindefinite and unlimited character, for his lifetime]monarchof Rome; with which view it may be presumed that Marius

diately after countermanding the solemnities, departed forCampania to join his army. To terrify the unarmed consulby bludgeons or the defenceless capital by the swords of thelegions, amounted to the same thing in the end: Sulpiciusexpected that his opponent, now when he could, would re­quite violence with violence and return to the capital at thehead of his legions to overthrow the conservative dema­gogue and his laws along with him. Perhaps he was mis­taken. Sulla was as eager for the war against Mithradatesas he was probably averse to meet the political exhalations ofthe capital; considering his original spirit of indifference andhis unrivalled political nonchalance, there is great proba­bility, that he by no means meditated the coup (Hitat whichSulpicius anticipated, and that, if he had been let alone, hewould have embarked without delay with his troops forAsia so soon as he had captured Nola, with the siege ofwhich he was still occupied.
But, be this as it might, Sulpicius, with a view to parry Marius no-the anticipated blow, conceived the scheme of taking the minatedsupreme command from Sulla; and for this purpose joined fommandfi'-with Marius, whose name was still sufficiently popular to gJiia'smake a proposal to transfer to him the chief command in stead.the Asiatic war appear plausible to the multitude, andwhose military position aud ability might prove a supportin the event of a rupture with Sulla. Sulpicius probablydid not overlook the danger involved in placing that old mannot less incapable than vengeful and ambitious at the headof the Campanian army, and as little the scandalous irre­gularity of intrusting an extraordinary supreme commandby decree of the people to a private man; but the very cir­cumstance of Marius' tried incapacity as a statesman gave asort of guarantee that he could not seriously endanger theconstitution, and above all Sulpicius' own position, if heformed a correct estimate of Sulla's designs, was one of soimminent peril that such considerations could hardly belonger heeded. That the worn-out hero himself shouldreadily meet the wishes of any one who would employ himas a condottiere, was a matter of course; his heart had nowfor many years longed for the command in an Asiatic war,and not less perhaps for an opportunity of settling accountsthoroughly with the majority of the senate.

and to take it up again in each successive year, till theearnestness of the demand and the pressure of publicopinion overbore resistance. Now things were carried witha higher hand. Gracchus seemed to himself to have reachedthe point, when he must either wholly renounce his reformor begin a revolution. He took the latter course, when hecame before the burgesses with the declaration that eitherhe or Octavius must retire from the college, and suggestedto Octavius that a vote of the burgesses should be taken asto which of them they wished to dismiss. Deposition fromoffice was, according to the Roman constitution, a constitu­tional impossiblity; Octavius naturally refused to consentto a proposal insulting to the laws and himself. Then Grac­chus broke off the discussion with his colleague, and turnedto the assembled multitude with the question whether atribune of the people, who acted in opposition to the people,had not forfeited his office; and the assembly, long accus­tomed to agree to all proposals presented to it, and for themost part composed of the agricultural proletariate whichhad flocked in from the country and was personally in­terested in the carrying of the law, gave almost unanimouslyan affirmative answer. Marcus Octavius was at the biddingof Gracchus removed by the lictors from the tribunes'bench; and then, amidst universal rejoicing, the agrarian lawwas carried and the first allotment commissioners werenominated. The votes fell on the author of the law alongwith his brother Gaius, who was only twenty years of age,and his father-in-law Appius Claudius. Such a family-selection augmented the indignation of the aristocracy. Whenthe new magistrates applied as usual to the senate to obtainthe moneys for their equipment and for their daily allow­ance, the former was refused, and a daily allowance wasassigned to them of 24 asses (1 shilling). The feud spreaddaily more and more, and became more envenomed andmore personal. The difficult and intricate task of defining,confiscating, and distributing the domains carried strifeinto every burgess-community, and even into the alliedItalian towns.Further The aristocracy made no secret that, while they would

which had been pending for more than thirty years betweenthe city and the king as to the possession of the province ofEmporia on the Lesser Syrtis, one of the most fertile in theCarthaginian territory, was at length (about 593) decided 161.by Roman commissioners to the effect that the Cartha­ginians should evacuate those towns of Emporia which stillremained in their possession, and should pay 500 talents(£122,000) to the king as compensation for the illegalenjoyment of the territory. The consequence was, that Mas-sinissa immediately seized another Carthaginian district onthe western frontier of their territory, the town of Tuscaand the great plains near the Bagradas; no course was leftto the Carthaginians but to commence another hopeless pro­cess at Rome. After long and, beyond doubt, intentionaldelay a second commission appeared in Africa; but, whenthe Carthaginians were unwilling to commit themselvesunconditionally to a decision to be pronounced by it asarbiter without an exact preliminary investigation into thequestion of right, and insisted on a thorough discussion ofthe latter question, the commissioners without further cere­mony returned to Home.
The question of right between Carthage and Massinissa The de-thus remained unsettled; but the mission gave rise to a struction ofmore important decision. The head of the commission had Carthagebeen the old Marcus Cato, at that time perhaps the most at Rome°influential man in the senate, and, as a veteran survivorfrom the Hannibalic war, still filled with thorough hatredand thorough dread of the Phoenicians. With surprise andjealousy Cato had seen with his own eyes the flourishingstate of the hereditary foes of Rome, the luxuriant countryand the crowded streets, the immense stores of arms inthe magazines and the rich materials for a fleet; alreadyhe in spirit beheld a second Hannibal wielding all theseresources against Rome. In his honest and manly, butthoroughly narrow-minded, fashion he came to the conclu­sion that Rome could not be secure until Carthage had dis­appeared from the face of the earth, and immediately afterhis return set forth this view in the senate. Those of thearistocracy whose ideas were more enlarged, and especiallyScipio Nasica, opposed this paltry policy with great earnest­ness; and showed how blind were the fears entertainedregarding a mercantile city whose Phoenician inhabitantswere more and more disused to warlike arts and ideas, and

These new Cornelians, whose civil existence waslinked to the legal validity of the institutions of theirpatron, were designed to be a sort of body-guard for theoligarchy and to help it to command the city populace, onwhich, indeed, in the absence of a garrison everything in thecapital primarily depended.Abolition of These extraordinary pillars of support on which thethe Giac- regent made the oligarchy primarily to rest, weak andchan insti- ephemeral as they probably appeared to their author, wereyet its only possible supports, unless expedients were to beresorted to—such as the formal institution of a standingarmy in Rome and other similar measures—which would haveput an end to the oligarchy far sooner than the attacks ofdemagogues. The permanent foundation of the ordinarygoverning power of the oligarchy was naturally and neces­sarily the senate, with a power so increased and so concen­trated that it presented a superiority to its non-organizedopponents at every single point of attack. The system ofcompromises followed for forty years was at an end. TheGracchan constitution, still spared in the first Sullan reform88. of 666, was now utterly abolished. Since the time of GaiusGracchus the government had conceded, as it were, theright of emeute to the proletariate of the capital, and boughtit off by regular distributions of corn to the burgesses domi­ciled there; Sulla abolished these largesses. Gaius Grac­chus had organized and consolidated the order of capitalistsby the letting of the tenths and customs of the province ofAsia in Rome; Sulla did away with the system of middle­men, and converted the former contributions of the Asiaticsinto fixed taxes, which were assessed on the several districtsaccording to the valuation-rolls drawn up for the purposeof gathering in the arrears.* Gaius Gracchus had by

Everywhere the Italians kept together ascompact and organized masses, the soldiers in their legions,the merchants of every larger town as special associations,the Roman burgesses domiciled or sojourning in the severaljudicial districts of the provinces as "circuits" (conventuscivium Romanorum) with their own list of jurymen and insome measure with a communal constitution; and, thoughthese provincial Romans ordinarily returned sooner or laterto Italy, they nevertheless gradually laid the foundations ofa settled mixed population in the provinces, partly Roman,partly attaching itself to the Roman settlers.

Gracchus first distinctly de­veloped the idea of colonizing, or in other words of Roman­izing, the provinces of the Roman state by Italian emigration,and endeavoured to carry it out; and, although the conser­vative opposition resisted the bold project, destroyed for themost part the colonies first established, and prevented itscontinuation, yet the colony of Narbo was preserved intact,important even of itself as extending the range of the Latintongue, and far more important still as the landmark of agreat idea, the foundation-stone of a mighty structure tocome.

towards the end of his life new troubles disturbed his reign;and, while the grandees of the kingdom and in fact hisown brother Orodes rebelled against the king and at lengththat brother overthrew him and put him to death, the hither-Armenia, to unimportant Armenia rose into power. This country,which since its declaration of independence (ii. 274) had beendivided into the north-eastern portion or Armenia proper,the kingdom of the Artaxiadae, and the south-western orSophene, the kingdom of the Zariadridae, was for the firsttime united into one kingdom by the Artaxiad Tigranea94. (who had reigned since 660); and this doubling of hispower on the one hand, and the weakness of the Parthianrule on the other, enabled the new king of all Armenia notonly to free himself from dependence on the Parthians andto recover the provinces formerly ceded to them, but evento bring to Armenia the titular supremacy of Asia, as ithad passed from the Achaemenids to the Seleucids and fromthe Seleucids to the Arsacids.Asia Minor. Lastly in Asia Minor the territorial arrangements, whichhad been made under Roman influence after the dissolutionof the kingdom of Attalus (P. 56), still subsisted in themain unchanged; except that Great Phrygia, after GaiusGracchus had discovered the dealings between MithradatesEuergetes and the consul Aquillius (P. 120), had beenagain withdrawn from the king of Pontus and united as afree country with the Roman province of Asia, like Hellas120. with Macedonia (about 634). In the condition of thedependent states—the kingdoms of Bithynia, Cappadocia,Pontus, the principalities of Paphlagonia and Galatia, thenumerous city-leagues and free towns—no outward changewas at first discernible. But, intrinsically, the character ofthe Roman rule had certainly everywhere undergone amaterial alteration. Partly through the constant growth ofoppression naturally incident to every tyrannic government,partly through the indirect operation of the Roman revo­lution—in the seizure, for instance, of the property of thesoil in the province of Asia by Gaius Gracchus, in the Romantenths and customs, and in the human hunts which thecollectors of revenue added to their other avocations there—the Roman rule, barely tolerable even from the first, pressedso heavily on Asia that neither the king's crown nor thepeasant's hut there was any longer safe from confiscation,that every stalk of corn seemed to grow for the Boman

Meanwhile the Roman governor of Asia, Lucius Murena,bad fallen into fresh difficulties with king Mithradates. Thelatter had since the peace busied himself in strengtheninganew his dominion, which was shaken even in the northernprovinces; he had pacified the Colchians by appointing hisable son Mithradates as their governor; he had then madeaway with that son, and was now preparing for an expeditioninto his Bosporau kingdom. The assertion of Archelaus whohad meanwhile been obliged to seek an asylum with Murena(P. 309), that these preparations were directed against Rome,induced Murena, under the pretext that Mithradates stillkept possession of Cappadocian frontier districts, to movehis troops towards the Cappadocian Comana and to violatethe Pontic frontier (671). Mithradates contented himself 83.with complaining to Murena and, when that was in vain, tothe Roman government. In fact commissioners from Sullamade their appearance to dissuade the governor, but he didnot submit; on the contrary he crossed the Halys andentered on the undisputed territory of Pontus, whereuponMithradates resolved to repel force by force. His generalGordius had to detain the Roman army till the king cameup with far superior forces and compelled battle; Murenawas vanquished and with great loss driven back over theRoman frontier to Phrygia, and the Roman garrisons wereexpelled from all Cappadocia. Murena had the effrontery,no doubt, to call himself the victor and to assume the titleof imperator on. account of these events (672); but the 82.sharp lesson and a second admonition from Sulla inducedhim at last to push the matter no further; the peace Secondbetween Rome and Mithradates was renewed (673). eac^i

buting the domain lands with all the passionate vehemence,which was and continued hereditary in the Claudian house;and with the greater bitterness, apparently, because he badcome into personal conflict with Seipio jEmilianus in hiscandidature for the censorship. Similar views were expressedby Publius Crassus Mucianus (P. 56), the Pontifex Maxi-mus of the day, who was held in universal honour by thesenate and the citizens as a man and a jurist. Even hisbrother Publius Mucius Scaevola, the founder of scientificjurisprudence in Rome, seemed not averse to the plan ofreform; and his voice was of the greater weight, as he stoodin some measure aloof from either party. Similar were thesentiments of Quintus Metellus, the conqueror of Macedoniaand of the Achaeans, but respected not so much on accountof his warlike deeds as because he was a model of the olddiscipline and manners alike in his domestic and his publiclife. Tiberius Gracchus was closely connected with thesemen, particularly with Appius whose daughter he hadmarried, and with Mucianus whose daughter was marriedto his brother. It was no wonder that he cherished the ideaof resuming in person the scheme of reform, so soon as heshould find himself in a position which would constitution­ally allow him the initiative. Personal motives may havestrengthened this resolution. The treaty of peace, whichMancinus concluded with the Numantines in 617, was in 137.substance the work of Gracchus (P. 15); the recollection thatthe senate had cancelled it, that the general had been on itsaccount surrendered to the enemy, and that Gracchus withthe other superior officers had only escaped a like fatethrough the greater favour which he enjoyed among theburgesses, could not put the young, upright, and proudman in better humour with the ruling aristocracy. TheHellenic rhetoricians with whom he wns fond of discussingphilosophy and politics, Diophanes the Mytilenaean and GaiusBlossius the Cumaean, nourished within his soul the idealsover which he brooded: when his intentions became knownin wider circles, there was no want of approving voices, andmany a public placard summoned the grandson of Africanusto think of the poor people and the deliverance of Italy.

said to have fallen. After the subjugation of the Vaccaeans,Lusitanians, and Gallaecians, the whole peninsula, with theexception of the north coast, was now at least nominallysubject to the Romans.
A senatorial commission was sent to Spain in order to New orga-organize, in concert with Scipio, the newly won provincial nization ofterritory after the Roman method; and Scipio did what he sPain-could to obviate the effects of the disgraceful and stupidpolicy of his predecessors. The Caucani for instance,whose shameful maltreatment by Lucullus he had beenobliged to witness nineteen years before when a militarytribune, were invited by him to return to their town and torebuild it. Spain began once more to enjoy better times.The suppression of piracy, which found dangerous lurking-places in the Baleares, through the occupation of theseislands by Quiutus Caecilius Metellus in 631 was singu- 123.larly conducive to the prosperity of Spanish commerce;and in other respects also the fertile islands, inhabited by adense population which was unsurpassed in the use of thesling, were a valuable possession. How numerous theLatin-speaking population in the peninsula was even then,is shown by the settlement of 3000 Spanish Latins in thetowns of Palma and Pollentia (Pollenza) in the newlyacquired islands. In spite of various grave evils theRoman administration of Spain preserved on the whole thestamp which the Catonian period, and primarily TiberiusGracchus, had impressed on it. It is true that the Romanfrontier territory had not a little to suffer from the inroadsof the tribes but half subdued or not subdued at all on thenorth and west. Among the Lusitanians in particularthe poorer youths regularly congregated as banditti, andin large gangs levied contributions from their countrymenor their neighbours, for which reason, even at a much laterperiod, the isolated homesteads in this region were con­structed in the style of fortresses and were, in case of need,capable of defence; nor did the Romans succeed in puttingan end to these predatory habits in the inhospitable an$almost inaccessible Lusitanian mountains. But the succeed­ing wars assumed more and more the character of guerilladisorders, which every tolerably efficient governor wasable to repress with his ordinary resources; and in spiteof these inflictions on the border districts, Spain was themost flourishing and best-organized country in all the

vince was reduced to obedience. The two cities ofTermantia and Numantia alone had not yet opened theirgates to the Romans; but in their case also a capitulationhad been almost concluded, and the greater part of theconditions had been fulfilled by the Spaniards. Whenrequired, however, to deliver up their arms, they were re­strained like Viriathus by their genuine Spanish pride in thepossession of a well-handled sword, and they resolved tocontinue the war under the daring Megaravicus. It seemedfolly: the consular army, the command of which was taken141. up in 613 by the consul Quintus Pompeius, was four timesas numerous as the whole population capable of bearingarms in Numantia. But the general, who was whollyignorant of war, sustained defeats so severe under the141. 140. walls of the two cities (613, 614), that he preferred atlength to procure by means of negotiations the peacewhich he could not compel. With Termantia a definitiveagreement must have taken place. In the case of theNumantines the Roman general liberated their captives, andsummoned the community under the secret promise of favour­able treatment to surrender to him at discretion. The Nu­mantines, weary of the war, consented, and the generalactually limited his demands to the smallest possiblemeasure. Prisoners of war, deserters, and hostages weredelivered up, and the stipulated sum of money was mostly139. paid, when in 615 the new general Marcus PopilliusLaenas arrived in the camp. As soon as Pompeius saw theburden of command devolve on other shoulders, he, with aview to escape from the reckoning that awaited him atRome for a peace which was according to Roman ideasdisgraceful, lighted on the expedient of not merely breaking,but of disowning his word; and when the Numantinescame to make their last payment, in the presence of theirofficers and his own he flatly denied the conclusion ofthe agreement. The matter was referred for judicial deci­sion to the senate at Rome. While it was discussed there,the war beforeiNumantia was suspended, and Laenasoccupied himself with an expedition to Lusitania where hehelped to accelerate the catastrophe of Viriathus, and witha foray against the Lusones, neighbours of the Numan­tines. When at length the decision of the senate arrived,its purport was that the war should be continued. Thestate was thus ready to share in the knavery of Pompeius.

Its commander, the consul and pontifex maximusPublius Licinius Crassus Mucianus, one of the wealthiestand at the same time one of the most cultivated men inRome, equally distinguished as an orator and as a jurist,was about to besiege the pretender in Leucae, but duringhis preparations for that purpose allowed himself to besurprised and defeated by his too much undervalued oppo­nent, and was himself taken prisoner by a Thracian band.But he did not allow such an enemy the triumph of exhibit­ing the Roman commander-in-chief as a captive; he pro­voked the barbarians, who had captured him withoutknowing who he was, to put him to death (beginning of
130. 624), and the consular was only recognized when a corpse.With him, as it would seem, fell Ariarathes king of Cappa­docia. But not long after this victory Aristonicus wasattacked by Marcus Perpenna, the successor of Crassus;his army was dispersed, he himself was besieged and takenprisoner in Stratonicea, and was soon afterwards executed inRome.

The eastern portion of thekingdom of the Attalids was assigned to the client kings, soas to release the Romans from the defence of the frontier andthereby from the necessity of maintaining a standing forcein Asia; Telmissus (ii. 275) went to the Lycian confederacy;the European possessions in Thrace were annexed to theprovince of Macedonia; the rest of the territory wasorganized as a new Roman province, which like that ofCarthage was, not without design, designated by the nameof the continent in which it lay.

The consul Scaevola was urged to have thetraitor put to death at once. When that temperate man, byno means averse to reform in itself, indignantly refused theequally irrational and barbarous request, the consular PubliusScipio Nasica, a harsh and vehement aristocrat, summonedthose who shared his views to arm themselves as they couldand to follow him. Almost none of the country people had!come into town for the elections; the people of the citytimidly gave way, when they saw the nobles rushing alongwith fury in their eyes, and legs of benches and clubs in their"Bands.

First of all the players receive back their appro­priate masks, and greater care is observed as to the scenicarrangements, so that it is no longer the case, as withPlautus, that everything needs to be done on the street,whether belonging to it or not. Plautus ties and unties thedramatic knot carelessly and loosely, but his plot is drolland often striking; Terence, far less effective, keeps every­where account of probability, not unfrequently at the costof suspense, and wages emphatic war against the certainlysomewhat flat and insipid standing expedients of his prede­cessors, e.g., against allegoric dreams.f Plautus paints hischaracters with broad strokes, often as if after a pattern,always with a view to the more distant and gross generaleffect; Terence handles the psychological development witha careful and often excellent miniature-painting, as in theAdelphi for instance, where the two old men—the easybachelor enjoying life in town, and the sadly harassed notat all refined country-landlord—form a masterly contrast.The springs of action and the language of Plautus are drawnfrom the tavern, those of Terence from the household of thegood citizen. The lazy Plautine hostelry, the very uncon­strained but very charming damsels with the hosts duly cor­responding, the sabre-rattling troopers, the slave-worldpainted with an altogether peculiar humour, whose heavenis the cellar and whose fate is the lash, have disappeared inTerence or at any rate undergone improvement.

Lastly, in the matter of debt Gaius Gracchus made noalteration. But very respectable authorities assert, that heheld out to those in debt the hope of a diminution orremission of claims; which, if it is correct, must likewisebe reckoned among those popular measures of a radicalstamp.
While Gracchus thus leaned on the support of the multi- Prominenttude, which partly expected, partly received from him a "cogintionmaterial improvement of its position, he laboured with equal Jrian'ordeTenergy at the ruin of the aristocracy. Perceiving clearlyhow insecure was the power of the head of the state ifbased merely on the proletariate, he applied himself aboveall to split the aristocracy, and to draw a part of it over to hisinterests. The elements of such a rupture were already inexistence. The aristocracy of the rich, which had risen asone man against Tiberius Gracchus, consisted in fact of twoessentially dissimilar bodies, which may be in some mea­sure compared to the peerage and the city aristocracy ofEngland. The one embraced the practically close circle ofthe governing senatorial families who kept aloof from directspeculation and invested their immense capital partly inlanded property, partly as sleeping partners in the greatcompanies. The main body of the second class was com­posed of the speculators, who, as managers of these compa­nies or on their own account, conducted the mercantile andmoneyed transactions throughout the whole range of theRoman hegemony. We have already shown (ii. 386 et seq.)how the latter class, especially in the course of the sixthcentury, gradually took its place by the side of the sena­torial aristocracy, and how the legal exclusion of thesenators from mercantile pursuits by the Claudian ordinance,suggested by Gaius I'laminius the precursor of the Gracchi,drew an outward line of demarcation between the senatorsand the mercantile and moneyed men. In the presentepoch the mercantile aristocracy began, under the name ofthe " equestrian order," to exercise a decisive influence inpolitical affairs. This appellation, which originally belongedonly to the burgess-cavalry on service, came gradually to betransferred, at least in ordinary use, to all those who, aspossessors of an estate of at least 400,000 sesterces, wereliable to cavalry service in general, and thus comprehended

The farmore wTetched Asiatic militia, stationed further back, there-ujion gave themselves up as vanquished even before theyencountered the enemy; when the generals of Mithradatesapproached them, they dispersed. A Roman division was de­feated in Cappadocia; Cassius sought to keep the field inPhrygia with the militia, but he discharged it again withoutventuring on a battle, and threw himself with his few trust­worthy troops into the towns on the upper Meander, par­ticularly into Apamea. Oppius in like manner evacuatedPamphylia and shut himself up in the Phrygian Laodicea;Aquillius was overtaken while retreating at the Sangarius inthe Bithynian territory and so totally defeated, that he losthis camp and had to seek refuge at Pergamus in the Romanprovince; the latter also was soon overrun and Pergamusitself fell into the hands of the king, as likewise the Bosporusand the ships that were there. After each victory Mithra­dates had dismissed all the prisoners belonging to the militiaof Asia Minor, and had neglected no step to raise to a higherpitch the national sympathies that were from the first di­rected towards him.

Corinth—a treatment disapproved even by the apologists ofthe destruction of Numantia and Carthage, and far fromjustified, even according to Roman international law, by theabusive language uttered against the Roman deputies in thestreets of Corinth. And yet it by no means proceeded fromthe brutality of any single individual, least of all of Mum-mius, but was a measure deliberated and resolved on by theRoman senate. We shall not err, if we recognize it asthe work of the mercantile party, which even thus earlybegan to interfere in politics by the side of the aristocracyproper, and which in destroying Corinth got rid of a com­mercial rival. If the great merchants of Rome had any­thing to say in the regulation of Greece, we can understandwhy Corinth was singled out for punishment, and why theRomans not only destroyed the city as it stood, but alsoprohibited any future settlement on a site so pre-eminentlyfavourable for commerce. The Peloponnesian Argos thence­forth became the rendezvous for the Roman merchants, whowere very numerous in Greece. For the Roman wholesaletraffic, however, Delos was of greater importance. A Roman1S8. free port as early as 5S6, it had attracted a great part ofthe business of Rhodes (ii. 308), and now in a similar wayentered on the heritage of Corinth. This island remainedfor a considerable time the chief emporium for merchandisegoing from the East to the West.*Asia. In the third and more distant continent the Roman

immediately or afterwards made good by the Roman ex­chequer. Nevertheless these requisitions became, if not inthe theory of state-law, at any rate practically one of themost oppressive burdens of the provincials; and the moreso, that the amount of compensation was ordinarily settledby the government or by the governor after a one-sidedfashion. "We meet indeed with several legislative restric­tions on this dangerous right of requisition of the Romanchief magistrate: for instance, the rule already mentioned,that in Spain there should not be taken from the countrypeople by requisitions of grain more than the twentiethsheaf, and that the price of this should be equitably settled(ii. 212); the fixing of a maximum quantity of grain to bedemanded by the governor for the wants of himself and hisretinue; the previous adjustment of a definite and highrate of compensation for the grain which was frequently re­quired, at least from Sicily, for the wants of the capital. But,while by such rules the pressure of those requisitions on theeconomy of the communities and of individuals in the pro­vince was probably mitigated here and there, it was by nomeans removed. In extraordinary crises this pressure un­avoidably increased and often went beyond all bounds, forthen in fact the requisitions not unfrequently assumed theform of a punishment imposed or that of voluntary contri­butions enforced, and compensation was thus wholly with­held. Thus Sulla in 670-671 compelled the provincials 84-83.of Asia Minor, who certainly had very gravely offendedagainst Rome, to furnish to every common soldier quarteredamong them forty-fold pay (per day 16 denarii = 10*.) to everycenturion seventy-five-fold pay, in addition to clothing andmeals along with the right to invite guests at pleasure; thus• the same Sulla soon afterwards imposed a general contribu­tion on the client and subject communities (P. 371), inwhich case nothing, of course, was said of repayment.

They must have been, comparatively, very consider- dens-able;* for the costs of administration, the keeping of thepublic buildings in repair, and generally all civil expenseswere borne by the local budget, and the Roman government

independent command. In vain deputies from the Romansenate endeavoured to effect a reconciliation; a personalconference between the generals, on which the officers in­sisted, only widened the breach. When Caepio saw Maximusnegotiating with the envoys of the Cimbrians, he fanciedthat the latter wished to gain the sole credit of their subju­gation, and threw himself with his portion of the army alonein all haste on the enemy. He was utterly annihilated, sothat even his camp fell into the hands of the enemy (6 Oct.105. 649); and his destruction was followed by the no less com­plete defeat of the second Soman army. It is asserted that80,000 Roman soldiers and half as many of the immenseand helpless body of camp-followers perished, and that onlyten men escaped: this much is certain, that only a few outof the two armies succeeded in escaping, for the Romanshad fought with the river in their rear. It was a calamitywhich materially and morally far surpassed the day ofCannae. The defeats of Carbo, of Silanus, and of Longinushad passed without producing any permanent impression onthe Italians. They were accustomed to open every warwith disasters; the invincibleness of the Roman arms wasso firmly established, that it seemed superfluous to attend tothe pretty numerous exceptions. But the battle of Arausio,the alarming proximity of the victorious Cimbrian army tothe undefended passes of the Alps, the insurrections break­ing out afresh and with increased force both in the Romanterritory beyond the Alps and among the Lusitanians, thedefenceless condition of Italy, produced a sudden and fear­ful awakening from these dreams. Men recalled the neverwholly forgotten Celtic inroads of the fourth century, theday on the Allia and the burning of Rome: with the doubleforce at once of the oldest remembrauce and the freshestalarm the terror of the Gauls came upon Italy; through allthe west people seemed to be aware, that the Roman empirewas beginning to totter. As after the battle of Cannae,the period of mourning was shortened by decree of thesenate.* The new enlistments brought out the most painfulscarcity of men.

other places became Sullan colonies; to repeople Samniutnwas, as we have said, no part of the regent's design. A greatpart of these assignations took place after the Gracchanmode, so that the settlers were attached to an already exist­ing town-community. The comprehensiveness of this settle­ment is shown by the number of allotments distributed,which is stated at 120,000. Nevertheless isolated portionsof land were otherwise applied, as in the case of the landsbestowed on the temple of Diana at Mount Tifata; others,such as the Volaterran domain and part of the Arretine, re­mained undistributed; others in fine, according to the oldabuse legally forbidden (P. 134) but now reviving, weretaken possession of on the part of Sulla's favourites by theright of occupation. The objects, which Sulla aimed at in thiscolonization, were of a varied kind. In the first place, hethereby redeemed the pledge given to his soldiers. Secondly,he in so doing adopted the idea, in which the reform-partyand the moderate conservatives concurred, and in accord­ance with which he had himself as early as 666 arranged 88.the establishment of a number of colonies — the idea,namely, of augmenting the number of the small agriculturalproprietors in Italy by a breaking up of the larger posses­sions on the part of the government; how seriously he hadthis at heart, is shown by the renewed prohibition of theannexation of allotments. Lastly and especially, he saw inthese settled soldiers as it were standing garrisons, whowould protect his new constitution along with their ownright of property. For this reason, where the whole territorywas not confiscated, as at Pompeii, the colonists were notamalgamated with the town-community, but the old burgessesand the colonists were constituted as two bodies of burgessesassociated within the same enclosing wall. In other respectsthese colonial foundations were made on the same legal basisand in the same military form as those of previous times;the circumstance that they were based not directly, like theolder ones, but only indirectly on a law, inasmuch as theregent constituted them by virtue of the clause of theValerian law to that effect, made no difference de jure. Todesignate them as military colonies in contrast with the olderones, is only justifiable in so far as the distinction betweenthe soldier and the burgess, which was in other instancesdone away by the very colonization of the soldiers, was in­tended to remain and did remain in force in the Sullan

It was no season to resume—as thedemocratic general would perhaps otherwise have done—the interrupted scheme of conquest in Gaul, which GaiusGracchus had probably projected. From the battle-field ofAix the victorious army was conducted to the Po; and aftera brief stay in the capital, where Marius refused the triumphoffered to him until he had utterly subdued the barbarians,he arrived in person at the united armies. In the springof 653 they again crossed the Po, 50,000 strong, under 101.the consul Marius and the proconsul Catulus, and marchedagainst the Cimbri, who, in turn, seem to have marchedup the river with a view to cross the mighty stream at itssource.

The p"'Cimbri desired battle, and according to their custom sentto the Romans to settle the time and place for it; Mariusgratified them and named the next day—it was the 30th July,653—and the Raudine plain, a wide level space, which the 101.superior Roman cavalry found advantageous for their move­ments.

the efforts of the same man that the sovereign rabble of thecapital got itself alimented in return for its cares of govern­ment by the body of its subjects. Gracchus warmly disap­proved the disgraceful spoliation of the provinces, and notonly instituted proceedings of wholesome severity in parti •cular cases, but also procured the abolition of the thoroughlyinsufficient senatorial courts, before which even ScipioJSmilianus had vainly staked his whole influence to bringthe most decided criminals to punishment; yet be at thesame time, by the introduction of courts composed of mer­chants, surrendered the provincials with their hands fetteredto the party of material interests and thereby to a despotismstill more unscrupulous than that of the aristocracy hadbeen, and he introduced into Asia a taxation, compared withwhich even the mode of taxation established after the Car­thaginian model in Sicily might be called mild and humane—both measures to which he was led because he needed onthe one hand the party of moneyed men, and on the otherhand required new and comprehensive resources to meet hisdistributions of grain and other burdens newly imposed onthe finances. Gracchus beyond doubt desired a firm admi­nistration and a regular dispensation of justice, as nume­rous thoroughly judicious ordinances testify; yet his newsystem of administration rested on a continuous series ofindividual usurpations only formally legalized, and heintentionally brought the judicial system—which every well-ordered state would have endeavoured as far as possible toplace, if not above political parties, at any rate aloof fromthem—into the midst of the whirlpool of revolution. Cer­tainly the blame of these conflicting tendencies in GaiusGracchus is chargeable to a very great extent on his positionrather than on himself personally.

238 THE REVOLT OF THE ITALIAN SUBJECTS, [Book IV.


Opposition- Pescara, the town of Corfinium was selected as the Oppo-Rome. eition-Rome or city of Italia, whose citizenship was conferredon the burgesses of all the insurgent communities; there aForum and a senate-house were staked off on a suitablescale. A senate of five hundred members was chargedwith the settlement of the constitution and the superin­tendence of the war. In accordance with its directions theburgesses selected from the men of senatorial rank twoconsuls and twelve praetors, who, just like the two consulsand six praetors of Rome, were invested with the supremeauthority in war and peace. The Latin language, which waseven then the prevailing language among the Marsians andPieentes, continued in official use, but the Samnito lan­guage which predominated in Southern Italy was placed sideby side with it on a footing of equality; and the two weremade use of alternately on the silver pieces, which the newItalian state began to coin in its own name after Romanmodels and after the Roman standard, thus practicallyabolishing the monopoly of coinage which Rome had exer­cised for two centuries. It is evident from these arrange­ments—and was, indeed, a matter of course—that the Italiansnow no longer thought of wresting equality of rights fromthe Romans, but purposed to annihilate or subdue them andto form a new state. But it is also obvious, that their consti­tution was nothing but a pure copy of that of Rome or, inother words, was the ancient polity handed down by traditionamong the Italian nations from time immemorial—the organi­zation of a city instead of the constitution of a state—withcollective assemblies as unwieldy and useless as the Romancomitia, with a governing corporation which contained withinit the same elements of oligarchy as the Roman senate, withan executive administered in like manner by a plurality ofco-ordinate supreme magistrates. This imitation descendedto the minutest details; for instance, the title of consul orpraetor held by the magistrate in chief command was ex­changed also by the general of the Italians after a victory forthe title of Imperator. Nothing in fact was changed butthe name; on the coins of the insurgents the same image ofthe gods appears, the inscription only being changed fromRoma to Italia. This Rome of the insurgents was distin­guished—not to its advantage—from the original Romemerely by the circumstance, that, while the latter had atany rate an urban development and its unnatural position

Under all these circumstances even a taxation moderatein theory might become extremely oppressive in its actualoperation; and that it was so is beyond doubt, althoughthe financial oppression, which the Italian merchants andbankers exercised over the provinces, was probably felt as afar heavier burden on them than the taxation with all theabuses that attached to it.
All things considered, the income which Rome drew from Aggregate 11the provinces was not properly a taxation of the subjects in financial 11the sense which we now attach to that expression, butresult-rather in the main a revenue that may be compared withthe Attic tributes, by means of which the leading statedefrayed the expense of the military system which it main­tained. This explains the singularly small amount of thegross as well as of the net proceeds. There exists a state­ment, according to which the income of Rome, exclusive, itmay be presumed, of the Italian revenues and of the grainsupplied in kind to Italy by the decumani, up to 691 amounted 6>i.to not more than 200 millions of sesterces (£2,055.000);that is only two-thirds of the sum which the king of Egyptdrew from his country annually. The proportion can onlyseem strange at the first glance. The Ptolemies turned toaccount the valley of the Nile as great plantation-owners,and drew immense sums from their monopoly of the com­mercial intercourse with the East; the Roman treasury wasnot much more than the joint military chest of the com­munities united under Rome's protection. The net producewas probably still less in proportion. The only provincesyielding a considerable surplus were perhaps Sicily, wherethe Carthaginian system of taxation prevailed, and moreespecially Asia from the time that Gaius Gracchus, inorder to provide for his largesses of corn, had carried outthe confiscation of the soil and a general domanial taxationthere. According to manifold testimonies the finances ofthe Roman state were essentially dependent on the revenuesof Asia. The assertion sounds quite credible that the otherprovinces on an average cost nearly as much as they broughtin; in fact those which required a considerable garrison,such as the two Spains, Transalpine Gaul, and Macedonia,probably often cost more than they yielded. On the wholecertainly the Roman treasury in ordinary times possessed asurplus, which enabled them amply to defray the expense ofthe buildings of the state and city, and to accumulate a

But on theright wing Marcus Crassus overthrew the enemy and pur­sued him as far as Antemnae; this somewhat relieved theleft wing also, and an hour after sunset it in turn beganto gain ground. The fight continued the whole night andeven on the following morning; it was only the defectionof a division of 3000 men, who immediately turned theirarms against their former comrades, that put an end to thestruggle. Rome was saved. The army of the insurgents,for which there was no retreat, was completely extirpated.The prisoners taken in the battle—between 3000 and 4000 Slaughterin number, including the generals Damasippus, Carrinas, of the Pli'and the severely wounded Pontius—were by Sulla's orders sonels-on the third day after the battle brought to the VillaPublica in the Campus Martius and there massacred to thelast man, so that the clatter of arms and the groans of thedying were distinctly heard in the neighbouring temple ofBellona, where Sulla was just holding a meeting of thesenate. It was a ghastly execution, and it ought not to beexcused; but it is not right to forget that those same menwho perished there had fallen like a band of robbers on thecapital and the burgesses, and, had they found time, wouldhave destroyed them as far as fire and sword can destroy acity and its citizens.

As to Cappadocia,the Pontic rulers had not forgotten that this country andCappadocia on the sea had been formerly united, and con­tinually cherished ideas of reunion. Paphlagonia was occu­pied by Mithradates in concert with Nicomedes king ofBithynia, with whom he shared the land and thereby drewhim wholly over to his interests. To cover in some degreethe manifest violation of right, Nicomedes equipped one ofhis sons with the name of Pylaemenes and designated him asnominal ruler of Paphlagonia. The policy of the alliesadopted still worse expedients in Cappadocia. King Aria-rathes VI. was killed by Gordius, it was said by the orders,at any rate in the interest, of Ariarathes' brother-in-lawMithradates Eupator: his young son Ariarathes could onlymeet the encroachments of the king of Bithynia by meansof the ambiguous help of his uncle, in return for which thelatter then suggested to him that he should allow the mur­derer of his father, who had taken flight, to return to Cappa­docia. This led to a rupture and to war; but when the twoarmies stood ready for battle, the uncle requested a pre­vious conference with the nephew and thereupon cut downthe unarmed youth with his own hand. Gordius, the mur­derer of the father, then undertook the government by thedirections of Mithradates; and although the indignantpopulation rose against him and called the younger son ofthe last king to the throne, the latter was unable to offerany permanent resistance to the superior forces of Mithra­dates. The speedy death of the youth placed by the peopleon the throne gave to the Pontic king the greater liberty ofaction, because with that youth the Cappadocian royal housebecame extinct. A Pseudo-Ariarathes was proclaimed asnominal regent, just as had been done in Paphlagonia; underwhose name Gordius administered the kingdom as lieutenantof Mithradates.
Mightier than any native monarch for many a day had Empire ofbeen, Mithradates bore rule alike over the northern and MiUirada-the southern shores of the Black Sea and far into the tes'interior of Asia Minor. The resources of the king for warby land and by sea seemed immeasurable. His recruitingfield stretched from the mouth of the Danube to the Cauca-

these bands bad their head-quarters, the open country waswholly in the hands of the insurgents and Morgantia andother walled towns were already besieged by them, when theRoman governor with his hastily collected Sicilian andItalian troops fell upon the slave-army in front of Morgantia.He occupied the undefended camp; but the slaves, althoughsurprised, made a stand. In the combat that ensuedthe levy of the island not only gave way at the first onset,but, as the slaves allowed every one who threw down hisarms to escape unhindered, the militia almost without ex­ception embraced the good opportunity of taking their de­parture, and the Roman army completely dispersed. Hadthe slaves in Morgantia been willing to make common causewith their comrades before the gates, the town was lost;but they preferred to accept the gift of freedom in a legalway from their masters, and by their valour helped them tosave the town—whereupon the Roman governor declaredthe promise of liberty solemnly given by the masters to becancelled in law, as having been illegally wrung from them.Athenion. While the revolt thus spread after an alarming manner inthe interior of the island, a second broke out on the westcoast. It was headed by Athenion. He had been, just likeCleon, formerly a dreaded captain of banditti in his nativecountry of Cilicia, and had been carried thence as a slave toSicily. He secured, just as his predecessors had done, theadherence of the Greeks and Syrians especially by propheciesand other edifying impostures. Skilled however in war andsagacious as he was, he did not, like the other leaders, armthe whole mass that flocked to him, but formed out of themen able for warfare an organized army, while he consignedthe multitude to peaceful employment. In consequence ofhis strict discipline, which repressed all vacillation and allinsubordinate motions in his troops, and his gentle treat­ment of the peaceful inhabitants of the country and even ofthe captives, he gained rapid and great successes. TheRomans were on this occasion disappointed in the hope thatthe two leaders would fall out; Athenion voluntarilysubmitted to the far less capable King Tryphon, and thuspreserved unity among the insurgents.

stroyed in accordance with the treaty; the war-marine ofEgypt, once so powerful, was under its present indolentrulers in deep decay. The minor states, and particularly themercantile cities, had perhaps some armed transports; butthese were not even adequate for the task—so difficult in theMediterranean—of repressing piracy. This task necessa- Piracy,rily devolved on Rome as the leading power in the Mediter­ranean. • While a century previously the Romans had comeforward in this matter with especial and salutary vigour,and had in particular introduced their supremacy in theEast by a maritime police energetically handled for thegeneral good (ii. 73), the complete nullity of this police atthe very beginning of this period is a distinct indication ofthe fearfully rapid decline of the aristocratic government.Rome no longer possessed a fleet of her own; she wascontent to make requisitions for ships, when it seemednecessary, from the maritime towns of Italy, Asia Minor, andelsewhere. The consequence naturally was, that buceaueer-ing became organized and consolidated. Something perhaps,though not enough, was done towards its suppression,so far as the direct power of the Romans extended, in theAdriatic and Tyrrhene seas. The expeditions directedagainst the Dalmatian and Ligurian coasts at this epochaimed more especially at the suppression of piracy in thetwo Italian seas; for the same reason the Balearic islandswere occupied in 631 (P. 19). But in the Mauretanian and 123Greek waters the inhabitants along the coast and themariners were left to settle matters with the corsairs in oneway or another, as they best could; for Roman policy ad­hered to the principle of troubling itself as little as possibleabout these more remote regions. The disorganized andbankrupt commonwealths in the states along the coast thusleft to themselves naturally became places of refuge for thecorsairs; and there was no waut of such, more especially inAsia.
A bad pre-eminence in this respect belonged to Crete, Crete,which, from its favourable situation and the weakness orlaxity of the great states of the West and East, was the onlyone of all the Greek settlements that had preserved its inde­pendence. Roman commissioners doubtless came and wentto the island, but accomplished still less there than they dideven in Syria and Egypt.

alongside of the former Greek community. So much of thedomains as had already been distributed by non-colonialassignation, remained in the hands of the recipients; therestrictions imposed on them by Gracchus in the interest ofthe commonwealth—the ground-rent and the prohibition ofalienation—had already been abolished by Marcus Drusus.With reference on the other hand to the domains stillpossessed by right of occupation—which, over and above thedomain-land enjoyed by the Latins, must have mostly con­sisted of the estates retained by their holders in accordancewith the Gracchan maximum (P. 90)—it was resolved defini­tively to vindicate the rights of those who had hithertooccupied them and to preclude the possibility of future dis­tribution. It was primarily from these lands, no doubt,that the 36,000 new farm-allotments promised by Drususwere to have been formed; but they saved themselves thetrouble of inquiring where these hundreds of thousands ofjugera of Italian domain-land were to be found, and tacitlyshelved the Livian colonial law, which had served its purpose;the far from important colony of Scylacium (Squillace) isperhaps the only one referable to the colonial law of Drusus.On the other hand by a law, which the tribune of the peopleSpurius Thorius carried under the instructions of the senate,

The

It was added, that in future domain-landwas not to be occupied at all, but was either to be leased orto lie open as public pasture; in the latter case provisionwas made by the fixing of a very low maximum of ten headof large and fifty head of small cattle, that the large herd-owner should not practically exclude the small.

accumulating for centuries; the Roman magistrates weretorn to pieces by the multitude in the theatre itself, andimmediately, as if it were their intention by a fearful out­rage to cut off every chance of reconciliation, the gates wereclosed by command, of the magistracy, all the Romans re­siding in Asculum were put to death, and their property wasplundered. The revolt ran through the peninsula like theflame through the steppe. The brave and numerous people Marsiansof the Marsians took the lead, in connection with the small anu Sabel-but hardy confederacies in the Abruzzi—the Paelignians, anS,Marrucinians, Frentanians, and Vestinians. The brave andsagacious Quintus Silo, already mentioned, was here the soulof the movement. The Marsians were the first formallyto declare against the Romans, whence the war retainedafterwards the name of the Marsian war. The example thus Central andgiven was followed by the Samnite communities, and gene-- Southernrally by the mass of the communities from the Liris and the y'Abruzzi down to Calabria and Apulia; so that all Centraland Southern Italy was soon in arms against Rome.
The Etruscans and Umbrians on the other hand held by ItaliansEome, as they had already taken part with the equites friendlJ't0against Drusus (P. 224). It is a significant fact, that in Kome*these regions the landed and moneyed aristocracy had fromancient times preponderated and the middle-class had totallydisappeared, whereas among and near the Abruzzi the farmer-class had preserved its purity and vigour better than any­where else in Italy: it was from the farmers accordinglyand the middle class in general that the revolt substantiallyproceeded, whereas the municipal aristocracy still went handin hand with the government of the capital. This alsoreadily explains the fact, that there were m the insurgentdistricts isolated communities, and in the insurgent commu­nities minorities, adhering to the Roman alliance ; the Vesti-nian town Pinna, for instance, sustained a severe siege forEome, and a corps of loyalists that was formed in the Hir-pinian country under Minatius Magius of Mclttaum supportedthe Eoman operations in Campania. Lastly, there adheredto Rome the allied communities optimi juris—in CampaniaNola and Nuceria and the Greek maritime towns Nea-polis and Rhegium, and in like manner at least most ofthe Latin colonies, such as Alba and iEsernia—just as inthe Hannibalic war the Latin and Greek towns on thewhole had taken part with, and the Sabellian towns against,

Nevertheless they did not escape the jealousy and suspicionof Rome. In possession of the European shore of the Pro-pontis, of the west coast of Asia Minor, and of the interioras far as the Cappadocian and Cilician frontiers; and closelyconnected with the Syrian kings, one of whom, AntiochusEpiphanes (+590), had ascended the throne by the aid of 16+.the Attalids; king Eumenes II. had by his power, whichseemed still more considerable from the more and moredeep decline of Macedonia and Syria, instilled apprehensionin the minds even of its founders. We have already related(ii. 304) how the senate sought to humble and weaken thisally after the third Macedonian war by unbecoming diploma­tic artifices. The relations—perplexing from the very natureof the case—of the rulers of Pergamus towards the wholly orhalf free commercial cities within their kingdom, and towardstheir barbarous neighbours on its borders, became compli­cated still more painfully by this ill humour on the part oftheir patrons. As it was not clear whether, according tothe treaty of peace in 565, the heights of the Taurus in -89.Pamphylia and Pisidia belonged to the kingdom of Syria or tothat of Pergamus, the brave Selgians, nominally recognizing,as it would seem, the Syrian supremacy, made a prolongedand energetic resistance to Eumenes II. and Attalus II. inthe almost inaccessible mountains of Pisidia. The AsiaticCelts also, who for a time with the permission of theRomans had yielded allegiance to Pergamus, revolted fromEumenes and, in concert with Prusias king of Bithynia thehereditary enemy of the Attalids, suddenly began waragainst him about 587. The king had had no time to hire 107-mercenary troops; all his skill and valour could not preventthe Celts from defeating the Asiatic militia and overrunninghis territory; the peculiar mediation, to which the Romanscondescended at the request of Eumenes, has already beenmentioned (ii. 305). But, as soon as he had found timewith the help of his well-filled exchequer to raise an armycapable of taking the field, he speedily drove the wild hordesover the frontier; and, although Galatia remained lost tohim, and his obstinately continued attempts to maintain hisfooting there were frustrated by Roman influence,* he yet,

how the existence of that rich commercial city was quitecompatible with the political supremacy of Rome. Even theconversion of Carthage into a Roman provincial town mighthave been practicable, and indeed, compared with the presentcondition of the Phoenicians, perhaps even not unwelcome.But Cato desired not the submission, but the destruction ofthe hated city. His policy, as it would seem, found alliespartly in the statesmen who were inclined to bring thetransmarine territories into immediate dependence on Rome,partly and especially in the mighty influence of the Romanbankers and great capitalists on whom, after the destructionof the rich moneyed and mercantile city, its inheritancewould necessarily devolve. The majority resolved at thefirst fitting opportunity—respect for public opinion requiredthat they should wait for such—to bring about war withCarthage, or rather the destruction of the city.
The desired occasion was soon found. The provokingviolations of right on the part of Massinissa and the Romansbrought to the helm in Carthage Hasdrubal and Carthalo,the leaders of the patriotic party; which was not indeed,like the Achaeans, disposed to revolt against the Roman su­premacy, but was at least resolved to defend, if necessary,by arms against Massinissa the stipulated rights of theCarthaginians. The patriots ordered forty of the mostdecided partisans of Massinissa to be banished from thecity, and made the people swear that they would on noaccount ever permit their return; at the same time, inorder to repel the attacks that might be expected fromMassinissa, they formed out of the free Numidians anumerous army under Arcobarzanes, the grandson ofSyphax (about 600). Massinissa, however, was prudentenough not to take arms now, but to submit himself uncon­ditionally to the decision of the Romans respecting thedisputed territory on the Bagradas; and thus the Romanscould assert with some plausibility that the Carthaginianpreparations must have been directed against them, andcould insist on the immediate dismissal of the army anddestruction of the naval stores. The Carthaginian senatewas disposed to consent, but the multitude prevented theexecution of the decree, and the Roman envoys, who hadbrought this order to Carthage, were in peril of their lives.Massinissa sent his son Gulussa to Rome to report the con­tinuance of the Carthaginian warlike preparations by land

an impression on the courts of the East and even on thescoffing Alexandrians. His Hellenism was especially recog­nizable in the delicate irony of his discourse and in the classicpurity of his Latin. Although not strictly an author, he yet,like Cato, committed to writing "his political speeches,—they were, like the letters of his adopted sister the motherof the Gracchi, esteemed by the later litteratores as master­pieces of model prose—and took pleasure in surroundinghimself with the better Greek and Roman litterati, a plebeiansociety which was doubtless regarded with no small sus­picion by those colleagues in the senate whose noble birthwas their sole distinction. A man morally steadfast andtrustworthy, his word held good with friend and foe;he avoided buildings and speculations, and lived withsimplicity; and in money matters he acted not merelyhonourably and disinterestedly, but also with a tendernessand liberality which seemed singular to the mercantile spiritof his contemporaries. He was an able soldier and officer;he brought home from the African war the honorary wreathwhich was wont to be conferred on such as saved thelives of citizens in danger at the peril of their own, andterminated as general the war which he had begun as anofficer; circumstances gave him no opportunity of tryinghis skill as a general on tasks really difficult. Scipio wasnot, any more than his father, a man of genius—as is indi­cated by the very fact of his predilection for Xenophon, thesober soldier and correct author—but he was an honestand true man, who seemed pre-eminently called to stem theincipient decay by organic reforms. All the more signifi­cant is the fact, that he did not attempt it. It is true thathe helped, as he had means and opportunity, to redress orprevent abuses, and laboured in particular at the improve­ment of the administration of justice. It was chiefly by hisassistance that Lucius Oassius, an able man of the old Romanausterity and uprightness, was enabled to carry against themost vehement opposition of the Optimates his law as tovoting, which introduced vote by ballot for those popular tri­bunals which still embraced the most important part of thecriminal jurisdiction (P. 73).

some decennia after the time of the Gracchi among not morethan eighty-four lessees, to each of whom there thus fell onan average 360 jugera, and among whom only one was a Leon-tine; the rest were foreign, mostly Romau, speculators. Wesee from this instance, with what zeal the Roman speculatorsthere walked in the footsteps of their predecessors, and whatextensive dealings in Sicilian cattle and Sicilian slave-cornmust have been carried on by the Roman and non-Romanspeculators who covered the beautiful island with their pas­tures and plantations. Italy however still remained forthe present substantially exempt from this worst form ofslave-husbandry. Although in Etruria, where the planta­tion system seems to have first emerged in Italy, and whereit existed most extensively at any rate forty years after­wards, it is extremely probable that even now ergastula werenot wanting; yet Italian agriculture at this epoch was stillchiefly carried on by free persons or at any rate by un­chained slaves, while the greater labours were frequentlylet to contractors. The difference between Italian andSicilian slavery is very clearly apparent from the fact, thatthe slaves of the Mamertiue community, which lived afterthe Italian fashion, were the only slaves who did not take135-132. part in the Sicilian servile revolt of 619-622.
The abyss of misery and woe, which opens before our eyesin this most miserable of all proletariates, we leave to befathomed by those who venture to gaze into such depths; itis very possible that, compared with the sufferings of the Ro­man slaves, the sum of all Negro suffering is but a drop. Herewe are not so much concerned with the distress of the slavesthemselves as with the perils which it brought upon theRoman state, and with the conduct of the government inconfronting them. It was plain that this proletariate hadnot been called into existence by the government and couldnot be directly set aside by it; this could only have beenaccomplished by remedies, which would have been stillworse than the disease. The duty of the government wassimply, on the one hand, to avert the direct danger toproperty and life, with which the slave-proletariate threat-'ened the members of the state, by an earnest system of
precautionary police; and on the other hand, to aim at the'restriction of the proletariate, as far as possible, by the
elevation of free labour. Let us see how the Romanaristocracy executed these two tasks.

An Conflictsexpedition into the Alps above Nice and Antibes, directed J7.l1" 'neagainst the Ligurian Oxybii and Decietes, was undertaken lSunans<by the Romans in 600 partly at the request of the Mas- 154.siliots, partly in their own interest; and after hot conflicts,some of which were attended with much loss, this districtof the mountains was compelled to furnish thenceforthstanding hostages to the Massiliots and to pay them a yearlytribute. It is not improbable that about this same periodthe cultivation of the vine and olive, which flourished inthis quarter after the model set by the Massiliots, was inthe interest of the Italian landholders and merchantssimultaneously prohibited throughout the territory beyondthe Alps dependent on Massilia.* A similar character of and thefinancial speculation marks the war, which was waged by Salassi.the Romans under the consul Appius Claudius in 611 143.against the Salassi respecting the gold mines and gold wash­ings of Victumulae (in the district of Vercelli and Bard andin the whole valley of the Dorea Baltea). The great extent ofthese washings, which deprived the inhabitants of the countrylying lower down of water for their fields, first gave rise toan attempt at mediation and then to the armed interventionof the Romans. The war, although the Romans began itlike all the other wars of this period with a defeat, led atlast to the subjugation of the Salassi and the cession of thegold district to the Roman treasury. Some forty yearsafterwards (654) the colony of Eporedia (Ivrea) was insti- 190.tuted on the territory thus gained, chiefly perhaps with aview to command the western, as Aquileia commanded theeastern, passage of the Alps.
