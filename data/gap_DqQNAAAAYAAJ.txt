on chariots and cars, made towards them with such aprodigious clatter, from the trampling of the cattle androlling of wheels, as affrighted the horses of the Ro­mans, unaccustomed to such tumultuous operations.By this means the victorious cavalry were dispersed,through a panic, and men and horses, in their headlongflight, were tumbled promiscuously on the ground.The same cause produced disorder even in the batta­lions of the legions : through the impetuosity of thehorses, and of the carriages which they dragged throughthe ranks, many of the soldiers in the van were troddenor bruised to death ; while the Gallic line, as soOn asthey saw their enemy in confusion, pursued the advan­tage, nor allowed them time to take breath. Decius,calling aloud ' Whither were they flying, or what hopecould they have in running away V strove to stop themas they turned their backs; but finding that he couldnot, by any efforts, prevail on them to keep theirposts, so thoroughly were they dismayed, he called onthe name of his father Publius Deciu,s, and said, ' Whydo I any longer defer the fate entailed on my family?It is the appointment of destiny to our race that weshould serve as expiatory victims to avert the publicdanger. I will now offer the legions of the enemy,together with myself, a bloody sacrifice to Earth, andthe infernal gods.' Having thus said, he commandedMarcus Livius, a pontiff, whom, at his coming out tothe field, he had charged not to stir from him, to dic­tate the form of words in which he was to devote him­self, and the legions of the enemy, for the army of theRoman people, the Quirites. He was accordingly de­voted with the same imprecations, and in the samehabit, in which his father Publius Decius had orderedhimself to be devoted at the Veseris in the Latine war.After this he added, that ' he carried along with himdismay and flight, slaughter and blood, and the wrathof the gods celestial and infernal: that, with the con­tagious influence of the Furies, the ministers of death,whose victim he was, he would infect the standards,the weapons, and the armor of the enemy; and on the

unarmed, and only partly clothed : that the other con­ditions of peace should be such as were just and pro­per between the conquerors and the conquered. Theirtroops must depart, and their colonies be withdrawnout of the territories of the Samnites ; and for the fu­ture the Romans and Samnites, under a treaty ofequality, shall live according to their own respectivelaws. On these terms he was ready to negotiate withthe consuls ; and if any of these should not be accepted,he forbade the ambassadors to come to him again.'When the result of this embassy was made known,such general lamentation suddenly arose, and suchmelancholy took possession of every mind, that hadthey been told that all were to die on the spot theycould not have felt deeper affliction. Silence con­tinued a long time, the consuls not being able to uttera word either in favor of a treaty so disgraceful oragainst a treaty so necessary : at length Lucius Lentu-lus, who was the first among the lieutenants-general,both in respect of bravery and of the public honorswhich he had attained, addressed them thus: ' Con­suls, I have often heard my father say that he wasthe only person in the capitol who did not advise thesenate to ransom the state from the Gauls with gold ;and this he would not concur in, because they had notbeen inclosed with a trench and rampart by the enemy,(who were remarkably slothful with respect to worksand raising fortifications,) and because they mightsally forth, if not without great danger, yet withoutcertain destruction. Now if, in like manner, as theyhad it in their power to run down from the capitol inarms against their foe, as men besieged have often sal­lied out on the besiegers, it were possible for us tocome to blows, either on equal or unequal ground, theadvice which I should give would not be devoid of thesame spirit which animated my father. I acknowlege,indeed, that death, in defence of our country, is highlyglorious ; and I am ready, either to devote myself forthe Roman people and the legions, or to plunge intothe midst of the enemy.

ing summoned an assembly of the people, before thecenturies were called to give their votes he spoke atlength on the great importance of the Etrurian war,and said that ' even at the time when he himself actedthere, in conjunction with his colleague, the war wastoo weighty to be managed by one general or one army;and that it was now reported that the enemy had sincethat time gained an accession of the Umbrians, and anumerous body of Gauls.' He desired them to ' bearin mind that they were on that day to choose consuls,who were to command in a war against four nations :for his own part, were he not confident that the Romanpeople would concur in appointing to the consulshipthe man who was allowed, beyond dispute, to be thefirst commander at present in the world, he would haveimmediately nominated a dictator.'
22. No doubt was entertained but that the universalchoice would light on Quintus Fabius ; and accord­ingly, the prerogative, and all the first called centuries,named him consul with Lucius Volumnius. Fabiusspoke to the same purpose as he had done two yearsbefore ; but afterwards, yielding to the general wish,he applied himself to procure Decius to be appointedbis confederate: ' that,' he said, ' would be a prop tohis declining age. In the censorship, and two consul­ships, in which they had been associated, he had ex­perienced that there could be no firmer support, in pro­moting the interest of the commonwealth, than harmouywith a colleague. At his advanced stage of life, hismind could hardly conform itself to a new associate incommand ; and he could more easily act in concert witha temper to which he had been familiarised.' Volum­nius subscribed to these sentiments, bestowing duepraises on Publius Decius, and enumerating ' the ad­vantages resulting from concord between consuls, andthe evils arising from their disagreement in the conductof military affairs ;' at the same time remarking, ' hownear the extremity of danger matters had been broughtby the late dispute between Appius and himself.'

Thisyear great numbers were prosecuted by the ediles, forhaving in possession larger quantities of land than thestate allowed: and hardly any were acquitted: bywhich means a very great restraint was laid on exor­bitant covetousness.
14. Whilst the new consuls, [A.U.C. 455. B.C. 297]Quintus Fabius Maximus, a fourth, and Publius De­cius Mus, a third time, were settling between them­selves as to which should command against the Sam-nites, and which against the Etrurians, and what num­ber of forces would be sufficient for this and for thatprovince, and which would be the fitter commanderin each war, ambassadors arrived from Sutrium, Ne-pete, and Falerii, with intelligence that the states ofEtruria were holding assemblies on the subject of suingfor peace. In consequence of this information, thewhole force of their arms was directed against Sam-nium. The consuls took different routes, in order tosecure the more ready supply of provisions, and toleave the enemy in the greater uncertainty on whatquarter the war would fall. Fabius led his legions to­wards Samnium through the territory of Sora, and De­cius his through that of Sidicinum. As soon as theyarrived at the frontiers, both advanced briskly, spread­ing devastation wherever they came ; but still took careto explore the country, to a distance beyond where thetroops were employed in plundering. The enemy hadposted themselves in readiness for battle, in a retiredvalley near Tifernum ; intending, as soon as the Ro­mans should enter it, to fall on them with advantage ofthe ground ; but they escaped the snare. Fabius send­ing away his baggage to a place of safety, and settinga small guard over it, gave notice to his soldiers thata battle was at hand, and advanced to the place wherehe had been told the enemy lay in ambush.

eyes: so deeply were they affected by shame andgrief, that they shunned the conversation of these theirfriends. Next day, when some young nobles, who hadbeen sent from Capua to escort them on their road tothe frontiers of Campania, returned, they were calledinto the senate-house, and, in answer to the inquiriesof the elder members, said, that ' to them they seemeddeeply sunk in melancholy and dejection ; that thewhole body moved on in silence, almost as if theywere dumb ; the former genius of the Romans wasstruck mute, and that their spirit had been taken fromthem, together with their arms. Not one gave answerto those who saluted them ; as if, through fear, theywere unable to utter a word; and that their necksstill carried the yoke under which they had been sent.That the Samnites had obtained a victory, not onlyglorious but lasting; for they had subdued, not Romemerely, as the Gauls had formerly done, but what wasa much more warlike achievement, the Roman cou­rage.' These discourses were attentively listened to,and lamentations made in this assembly of faithful al­lies, as if the Roman name were almost extinct. Weare told that Ofilius Calavius, son of Ovius, a manhighly distinguished both by his birth and conduct,and at this time farther respectable on account of hisage, declared that he entertained a very different opi­nion in the case. ' This obstinate silence,' said he;' those eyes fixed on the earth ; those ears deaf to allcomfort, with the shame of beholding the light, areindications of a mind calling forth, from its inmost re­cesses, the utmost exertions of resentment. Either hewas ignorant of the temper of the Romans, or that si­lence would shortly excite, among the Samnites, la­mentable cries and groans; for that the remembranceof the Caudine peace would be much more sorrowfulto the Samnites than to the Romans. Each side wouldhave their own native spirit, wherever they shouldhappen to engage, but the Samnites would not, everywhere, have the glens of Caudium.'7.

15. The assembly being then dismissed, a consulta­tion was held, whether they should press forward thesiege of Luceria, with all their forces; or, whether oneof the commanders and his army should make trial ofthe dispositions of the rest of the Apulians, which werestill doubtful. The consul Publilius set out to make acircuit through Apulia, and in the one expedition eitherreduced by force, or received into alliance, on con­ditions, a considerable number of the states. Papiriuslikewise, who had remained to prosecute the siege ofLuceria, soon found the event agreeable to his hopes;for all the roads being blocked up, through which pro­visions used to be conveyed from Samnium, the Sam-nites in garrisons were reduced so low by famine, thatthey sent ambassadors to the Roman consul, proposingthat he should raise the siege, on receiving the horse­men who were the cause of the war. To whom Pa­pirius returned this answer, that ' they ought to haveconsulted Pontius, son of Herennius, by whose advicethey had sent the Romans under the yoke, what treat­ment he thought fitting for the conquered to undergo.But since, instead of offering fair terms themselves,they chose rather that they should be imposed on themby their enemies, be desired them to carry back ordersto the troops in Luceria, that they should leave withinthe walls their arms, baggage, beasts of burden, andall persons unfit for war. The soldiers he would sendunder the yoke with single garments, retaliating thedisgrace formerly inflicted, not setting the example.'All this they submitted to. Seven thousand soldierswere sent under the yoke, and an immense booty wasseized in the town, where the Romans retook all thestandards and arms which they had lost at Caudium ;and, what greatly increased their joy, recovered thehorsemen whom the Samnites had sent to Luceria tobe kept as pledges of the peace. Hardly ever did theRomans gain a victory more remarkable for the suddenreverse produced in the state of their affairs: especially

the crowd, (who expressed a degree of barbarous ragewhich could scarce be conceived to exist in humanbreasts,) prevailed on them to stop for a moment. Shethen told them, with tears in her eyes, that she had ahusband and children, prisoners among the enemy ; andthat she hoped to be able, with the king's body, (if theywould grant it to her,) however disfigured, to ransomher friends: this put an end to their outrages. Theremnants of his limbs were buried at Consentia, intirelythrough the care of the woman; and his bones weresent to Metapontum, to the enemy, from whence theywere conveyed to Epirus, to his wife Cleopatra, andhis sister Olympias ; the latter of whom was the mother,the former the sister, of Alexander the Great. Suchwas the melancholy end of Alexander of Epirus; ofwhich, although fortune did not allow him to engage inhostilities with the Romans, yet, as he waged war inItaly, I have thought it proper to give this brief ac­count. This year, the fifth time since the building ofthe city, the Lectisternium was performed at Rome,for procuring the favor of the same deities to whom itwas addressed before.
25. The new consuls having by order of the peopledeclared war against the Samnites, exerted themselvesin more formidable preparations of every kind thanhad been made against the Greeks; and about thesame time received a new accession of strength froma quarter where they had no such expectation. TheLucanians and Apulians, nations who until that timehad no kind of intercourse with the Roman people,proposed an alliance with them, promising a supplyof men and arms for the war: a treaty of friend­ship was accordingly concluded. At the same timetheir affairs went on successfully in Samnium. Threetowns fell into their hands, Allifae, Callifae, andRuffrium; and the adjoining country, to a great ex­tent, was on the first arrival of the consuls laid in­tirely waste. As the commencement of their opera­tions on this side was attended with so much success,so the war in the other quarter, where the Greeks were

As he was marching his legions towards Luceria, towhich he was informed that the Samnites had laidsiege, the enemy met him on the border of the Luce-rian territory. Rage supplied them, on this occasion,with strength to equal his : the battle was stubbornlycontested, and the victory doubtful: the issue how­ever proved more calamitous on the side of the Ro­mans, both because they were unaccustomed to defeat,and that on leaving the field they felt more sensiblythan during the heat of the action the number of theirwounds, and the loss of men which they had sustained.In consequence of this, such dismay spread throughthe camp as, had it seized them during the engage­ment, must have occasioned their overthrow. Even asthe matter stood, they passed the night in great anx­iety, expecting every instant that the camp would beassaulted by the Samnites; or that at the first lightthey should be obliged to stand a battle with an ap­parently powerful foe. On the side of the enemy,however, although there was less loss, yet there wasnot greater courage. As soon as day appeared theywished to retire without any more fighting ; but therewas only one road, and that leading close by the postof their enemy ; so that on their march it seemed asif they were advancing directly to attack the camp.The consul therefore ordered his men to take arms,and to follow him to the field, giving directions to thelieutenants-general, tribunes, and the prefects of theallies, in what manner he would have each of thempet. They all assured him that ' they would do everything in their power, but that the soldiers were quitedejected ; that, from their own wounds and the groansof the dying, they had passed the whole night withoutsleep ; that if the enemy had approached the campbefore day, so great were the fears of the troops, thatthey would certainly have deserted their standards.Even ftt present they were restrained from flightmerely by shame ; and in other respects were littlebetter than vanquished men.'

which dreaded the unknown sands and flats more thanthey did the Romans, and which showed a greatereagerness to escape into the deep, than to make re­sistance. The soldiers pursued them as far as the' mouth of the river; and having taken and burned apart of the fleet, which, in the hurry and confusion, hadbeen stranded, returned victorious. Cleonymus, hav­ing met success in no part of the Adriatic sea, de­parted with scarce a fifth part of his navy remaining.Many, now alive, have seen the beaks of his ships,and the spoils of the Lacedaemonians, hanging in theold temple of Juno. In commemoration of this eventthere is exhibited at Patavium, every year on its an­niversary day, a naval combat on the river in themiddle of the town.
3. A treaty was this year concluded at Rome withthe Vestinians, who solicited friendship. Variouscauses of apprehension afterwards sprung up. Newsarrived that Etruria was in rebellion the insurrec­tion having arisen from the dissentions of the Arre-tians; for the Cilnian family having grown exorbi­tantly powerful, a party, out of envy of their wealth,had attempted to expel them by force of arms. Ac­counts were also received that the Marsians heldforcible possession of the lands to which the colony ofCarseoli, consisting of four thousand men, had beensent. By reason therefore of these commotions Mar­cus Valerius Maximus was nominated dictator, andchose for his master of the horse Marcus /EmiliusPaullus. This I am inclined to believe, rather thanthat Quintus Fabius, at such an age as he then was,and after enjoying many honors, was placed in a sta­tion subordinate to Valerius: but I think it not un­likely that the mistake arose from the surname Maxi­mus. The dictator, taking the field at the head of anarmy, in one battle utterly defeated the Marsians,drove them into their fortified towns, and afterwards,in {be course of a few days, took Milionia, Plestina,and Fresilia; and then fining this people in a partof their lands, granted them a renewal of the treaty.

of the senate, that no person should dedicate a temple,or an altar, without an order from the senate, or froma majority of the plebeian tribunes. The incident whichI am about to mention would be trivial in itself, wereit not an instance of the freedom assumed by plebeiansin opposition to the pride of the nobles: Flavins comingto make a visit to his colleague, who was sick, someyoung nobles who were sitting there agreed amongthemselves not to pay him the compliment of rising athis entrance; on which he ordered his curule chair tobe brought thither, and from his honorable seat ofoffice enjoyed the sight of his enemies tortured withenvy. However, Flavius owed his appointment to theedileship to a faction composed of the lowest class ofpeople, which had gathered strength during the censor­ship of Appius Claudius: for he was the first who de­graded the senate, by electing into it the immediatedescendants of freedmen ; and when he found that noone allowed that election as valid, and that his conductin the senate-house had not procured him the influencein the city which it had been his principal object toattain, he distributed men of the meanest order amongall the several tribes, and thus corrupted the assembliesboth of the forum and of the field of Mars. With re­spect to the election of Flavius, it excited great indig­nation in the breasts of most of the nobles, who laidaside their gold rings and bracelets in consequence ofit. From that time the state was split into two parties.The uncorrupted part of the people, who favored andsupported the good, held one side; the faction of therabble, the other. Quintus Fabius and Publius Deciuswere then made censors; and Fabius, both for the sakeof concord, and at the same time to prevent the electionsremaining in the hands of the lowest of the people,purged the rest of the tribes of all the rabble of theforum, and threw it into four, which he ordered to becalled city tribes. And this procedure, we are told,gave such universal satisfaction that, by this regulationin the orders of the state, he obtained the surname ofMaximus, which he had not been honored with by his

of battle was fixed. The part of maintaining the fightwas committed to the Sainnites and Gauls ; and theEtrurians and Umbrians were ordered to attack theRoman camp during the heat of the engagement. Thisplan was frustrated by three Clusian deserters, whocame over by night to Fabius ; and after disclosing theabove designs were sent back with presents, in orderthat they might discover and bring intelligence of anynew scheme which should be formed. The consulsthen wrote to Flavins and Postumius to move theirarmies; the one from the Faliscian, the other from theVatican country, towards Clusium ; and to ruin theenemy's territory by every means in their power. Thenews of these depredations drew the Etrurians fromSentinum to protect their own region. The consuls,in their absence, practised every means to bring on anengagement. For two days they endeavored, by seve­ral attacks, to provoke the enemy to fight; in whichtime, however, nothing worth mention was performed.A few fell on each side ; but still the minds of the Ro­mans were so irritated as to wish for a general engage­ment, yet nothing decisive was hazarded. On the thirdday both parties marched out their whole force to thefield : here, while the armies stood in order of battle,a hind, chased by a wolf from the mountains, ranthrough the plain between the two lines: there theanimals turned their' courses to different sides ; thehind towards the Gauls, the wolf towards the Romans.Way was made between the ranks for the wolf; theGauls slew the hind with their javelins : on which oneof the Roman soldiers in the van said, ' To that side,where you see an animal sacred to Diana lying pros­trate, flight and slaughter are directed ; on this sidethe victorious wolf of Mars, safe and untouched, re­minds us of our founder, and of our descent from thatdeity.' The Gauls were posted on the right wing, theSamnites on the left: against the latter Fabius drewup, as his right wing, the first and third legions ;against the Gauls, Decius formed the left wing of thefifth and sixth.

30. Hannibal, therefore, as soon as he had determinedto proceed forward, and direct his operations against'Italy, called an assembly of the soldiers, and endea­vored, by the different methods of reproof and exhor­tation, to mould their minds to his purpose. ' He won­dered,' he said, ' what sudden terror could have takenpossession of breasts hitherto always undaunted. Du­ring such a number of years in which they carried arms,they were constantly victorious; nor had left Spainuntil all the nations and countries comprehended be­tween the two opposite seas were under subjection toCarthage.

Cornelius was less numerous, because Lucius Manlius,a pretor, was also sent into Gaul with a considerableforce. Of ships, particularly Cornelius' share wassmall: sixty quinqueremes only w.ere given him, for itwas not supposed either that the enemy would comeby sea, or that he would exert himself on that element.Two Roman legions, with their regular proportion ofcavalry, and of the allies fourteen thousand foot andsixteen hundred horse were assigned to him. In thisyear the province of Gaul, though not yet threatenedwith a Carthaginian war, had posted in it two Romanlegions, and ten thousand confederate infantry, withone thousand confederate horsemen and six hundredRoman.
18. These adjustments being made, they yet deter­mined, previous to the taking up arms, to send Quin-tus Fabius, Marcus Livius, Lucius iEmilius, Caius Li-cinius, and Quintus Baebius, men venerable on accountof their age, into Airica, as ambassadors, to require anexplanation from the Carthaginians, whether Hanni­bal's attack on Saguntum had been authorised by thestate ; and in case they should acknowlege it, as it wasexpected they would, and defend that proceeding, thento declare war against the people of Carthage. Whenthe Romans arrived at Carthage, and were introducedto an audience of the senate, Quintus Fabius, withoutenlarging on the subject, simply proposed the questionas stated in their instructions; on which one of theCarthaginians replied, ' Romans, in your former em­bassy you were too precipitate, when you demandedthat Hannibal should be delivered up, as attackingSaguntum of his own authority. But your presentproceeding, though hitherto milder in words, is, ineffect, more unreasonably severe.

the land of their fathers, from the soil in which theywere born. What sighs would it draw from these,'said he, ' who were accustomed to carry war to thevery walls of Carthage, if they were to see us, theiroffspring, at the head of consular armies, skulkingwithin our camp in the heart of Italy, and a Carthagi­nian possessed of the dominion over the whole extentof country between the Alps and the Apennines?' Inthis manner did he argue, sitting with his colleague,and also at the head-quarters, as if he were haranguingan assembly. He was, besides, incited to expeditiousmeasures by the approach of the time of the elections,for he feared lest the war should be protracted untilthe new consuls came into office ; wishing likewise tosecure the present opportunity, and while his col­league was indisposed, of engrossing to himself thewhole of the glory. For these reasons, while Scipioremonstrated in vain, he issued orders to the soldiersto be ready for battle at a short warning. Hannibal,plainly perceiving what line of conduct would be moreadvantageous to the enemy, scarcely entertained anydistant hope that the consuls would enter on any ac­tion without caution and foresight; but understanding,first from report, and afterwards from experience, thatthe temper of one of them was fiery and presumptuous,and supposing his presumption augmented by the suc­cess of the battle with the plundering party, he thenmade little doubt but that he should soon have an op­portunity of coming to action—an occasion which hewas earnestly solicitous to improve, while the troopsof the enemy were raw, while the more able of theircommanders was, by his wound, rendered incapable ofexertion, and while the Gauls were disposed to actwith vigor; for he well knew that these, whose num­ber was very great, would follow him with the lesszeal, in proportion as they were drawn away to agreater distance from home.

As to the artful and the ingenious lawyersand orators, such as Appius Claudius, they ought tobe kept at home to preside in the city and the forum ;and to be appointed pretors for the administration ofjustice/ In these proceedings that day was spent, and,on the following, the elections both of consuls and pre-tor were held, and were guided by the recommendationssuggested by the consul. Quintus Fabius and PubliusDecius were chosen consuls ; Appius Claudius pretor;all of them absent; and, by a decree of the senate, fol­lowed by an order of the commons, Lucius Volumniuswas continued in the command for another year.
23. During that year many prodigies happened. Toavert the evils which they might portend, the senatedecreed a supplication for two days : the wine andfrankincense for the sacrifices were furnished at theexpense of the public; and numerous crowds of menand women attended the performance. This supplica­tion was rendered remarkable by a quarrel which brokeout among the matrons in the chapel of patrician chas­tity, which stands in the cattle market, near the roundtemple of Hercules. Virginia, daughter of Aulus, apatrician, but married to Volumnius the consul, a ple­beian, was on that account excluded by the matronsfrom sharing in the sacred rites: a short altercationensued, which was afterwards, through the intempe­rance of passion incident to the sex, kindled into aflame of contention. Virginia boasted with truth thatshe had a right to enter the temple of patrician chastity,as being of patrician birth, and chaste in her character,and, besides, the wife of one, to whom she was be­trothed a virgin, and had no reason to be ashamedeither of her husband, or of his exploits or honors: toher high-spirited words she added importance by anextraordinary act.

The houses of the city, some may say,and the walls of it, and the crowd who dwell in it.But, in fact, in case of the destruction of this army, allthese are given up to ruin, instead of being saved fromit: for who will protect them ? An unwarlike and un­armed multitude, shall I suppose? Yes, just as theydefended them against the attack of the Gauls. Willthey call to their succor an army from Veii, with Ca-millus at its head ? Here, on the spot, I repeat, areall our hopes and strength; by preserving which wepreserve our country ; by delivering them up to death,we abandon and betray it. But a surrender is shame­ful and ignominious. True : but such ought to be outaffection for our country, that we should save it by ourown disgrace, if necessity required, as freely as by ourdeath. Let us therefore undergo that indignity, bowgreat soever, and submit to that necessity to whicheven the gods themselves are seen to yield. Go, con­suls, ransom the state for arms, which your ancestorsransomed with gold.'

The consuls accordingly went to Pontius to con­fer with him; and when he talked in the strain of aconqueror, of a treaty, they declared that such couldnot be concluded without an order of the people, norwithout the ministry of the heralds and the other cus­tomary rites.

the Faliscians likewise, who had for many years livedin friendship with Rome, had united their arms withthose of the Etrurians. The consideration of the nearvicinity of that nation quickened the attention of thesenate; insomuch, that they passed a decree that he­ralds should be sent to demand satisfaction : whichbeing refused, war was declared against the Falisciansby direction of the senate and order of the people ;and the consuls were desired to determine, by lots,which of them should lead an army from Samniuminto Etruria. Carvilius had, in the mean time, takenfrom the Samnites Volana, Palumbinum, and Hercu-laneum : Volana after a siege of a few days, Palumbi­num the same day on w hich he approached the walls.At Herculaneum, it is true, the consul had two regularengagements without any decisive advantage on eitherside, and with greater loss than was suffered by theenemy: but afterwards, encamping on the spot, heshut them up within their works, besieged, and tookthe town. In these three towns were taken or slainten thousand men, of whom the prisoners composedsomewhat the greater part. On the consuls castinglots for the provinces, Etruria fell to Carvilius, to thegreat satisfaction of the soldiers, who now found thecold too severe in Samnium. Papirius was opposed atSepinum with a more powerful force : he was obligedto fight often in pitched battles ; often on a march,and often under the walls of the city, against the ir­ruptions of the enemy; and could neither besiege norengage them on equal terms; for the Samnites had notonly the advantage of walls, but likewise of numbersof men and arms to protect their walls. At length,after a great deal of fighting, he forced them to submitto a regular siege. This he carried on with vigor, andmade himself master of the city by means of his worksand by storm. The rage of the soldiers on this occa­sion caused the greatest slaughter in the taking of thetown ; seven thousand four hundred fell by the sword ;the number of the prisoners did not amount to threethousand.

These eminences in realitywere inhabited, cultivated, produced and supportedanimals. Were they passable by small parties, andimpassable by armies? Those very ambassadors beforetheir eyes had not been carried aloft on wings over theAlps. Neither had their ancestors been natives of thesoil, but settlers, who came from other countries intoItaly, and who crossed with safety those same hills,often in vast bodies, with their wives and children, aaother colonies emigrate. To a soldier carrying nothingwith him but the implements of war what could be im­passable or insuperable ? In order to gain possessionof Saguntum, what toils, what dangers did they notundergo, for the space of eight months 1 Now, whentheir object was Rome, the capital of the world, whatdifficulty or danger should be deemed capable of re­tarding the enterprise ? The Gauls formerly madethemselves masters of those very places which the Car­thaginians despaired of approaching. Either, there­fore, they must yield the superiority in spirit and cou­rage to that nation which, during a short time past,they had so frequently overcome, or they must look,for the termination of their march in the field lyingbetween the Tiber and the walls of Rome.'

On the following day, heproceeded upwards along the bank of the Rhone, di­recting his route towards the interior parts of Gaul;not because that was the more direct road to the Alps,but because he thought that the farther he withdrewfrom the sea, the less probability there would be ofhis meeting with the Romans, with whom he did notintend to come to battle until he should have arrivedin Italy.

This intelligence, just as he received it, theking despatched in a letter to Marcus iEmilius, thepretor, whose province Sicily was, and cautioned himto secure Lilybaeum with a strong garrison. Immedi­ately the lieutenants-general and tribunes, who werewith the pretor, were sent off to the several states, withorders to keep their men attentive and alert in guardingtheir posts; and that, above all things, Lilybaeum shouldbe effectually secured. A proclamation was also pub­lished that, besides every warlike preparation, the mari­ners should bring on board the ships provisions for tendays ready dressed, so that no one should have anydelay to prevent his embarking the moment the signalshould be given; and that, through the whole extentof the coast, those stationed at the watch-towers shouldbe vigilant in looking out for the approach of the ene­my's fleet. In consequence of these precautions, not­withstanding that the Carthaginians purposely slackenedthe course of their ships, designing to reach Lilybaeuma little before day, they were observed on their ap­proach ; for the moon shone through the whole night,and Jthey came with their sails aloft: in the same in­stant the signal was made on the watch-towers, thealarm given in the town, and the men embarked in theships; one half of the soldiers mounted guard on thewalls and at the gates, the other were on board thefleet. On the other hand, the Carthaginians, perceivingthat preparations were made for their reception, re­mained until daybreak at the mouth of their harbor,employing the intermediate time in taking down theirrigging, and fitting their ships for action.

with such haste and eagerness, that in order to comethe sooner to a close engagement, they threw awaytheir javelins, drew their swords, and rushed on. Onthe other side, the Romans poured down on them,sometimes javelins, and sometimes stones, which theplace abundantly supplied; so that the blows on theirshields and helmets, confusing even those whom theydid not wound, kept them from closing with their foe ;and they had no missive weapons with which to act ata distance. While they stood still exposed to blowsagainst which they had no sufficient defence, some evengiving way, and the line growing unsteady and wavering, the Roman spearmen and the first rank renewingthe shout, poured down on them with drawn swords.This attack the Etrurians could not withstand, butfacing ahout fled precipitately towards their camp ;when the Roman cavalry getting before them hy gal­loping obliquely across the plain, threw themselves inthe way of their flight, on which they quitted the road,and hent their course to the mountains. From thence,in a body, almost without arms, and debilitated withwounds, they made their way into the Ciminian forest.The Romans, having slain many thousands of theEtrurians, and taken thirty-eight military standards,took also possession of their camp, together with avast quantity of spoil. They then began to considerof pursuing the enemy.
36. The Ciminian forest was in those days deemedas impassable and frightful as the German forests havebeen in latter times ; not even any trader having everattempted to pass it. Hardly any, besides the generalhimself, showed boldness enough to enter it; so freshwas the remembrance of the disaster at Caudium inevery one's mind. On this, Marcus Fabius, the con­sul's brother, (some say Caeso, others Claudius, bornof the same mother with the consul,) undertook to ex­plore the country, and to bring them in a short timean account of every particular.

Chap. 1. Under the succeeding consuls, Lucius Ge-nucius and ServiusCornelius, [A.U.C. 450. B.C. 302]the state enjoyed almost uninterrupted rest from fo­reign wars. Colonies were led out to Sora and Alba:for the latter, situated in the country of the jEquans,six thousand colonists were inrolled. Sora had for­merly belonged to the Volscian territory, but hadfallen into the possession of the Samnites: thither weresent four thousand settlers. This year the freedom ofthe state was granted to the Arpinians and Trebulans.The Frusinonians were fined a third part of their lands,because it was discovered that they had endeavoredto stir up the Hernicians to rebellion ; and the headsof that conspiracy, after a trial before the consuls, heldin pursuance of a decree of the senate, were beatenwith rods and beheaded. However, that the Romansmight not pass the year intirely exempt from war, alittle expedition was made into Umbria; intelligencebeing received from thence that numbers of men inarms had, from a certain cave, made excursions intothe adjacent country. Into this cave the troops pene­trated with their standards, and the place being dark,they received many wounds, chiefly from stonesthrown. At length the other mouth of the cave beingfound, for it was pervious, both the openings werefilled up with wood, which being set on fire, there pe­rished by means of the smoke and heat, no less than

carrying strong proofs of the ill treatment, none ofartifice, the people were so irritated that by theirclamors they compelled the magistrates to call toge­ther the senate; and whilst some stood round that as­sembly, insisting on a declaration of war against theRomans, others ran different ways to rouse to armsthe multitude residing in the country. Thus the mindseven of rational men being hurried into imprudence bythe general uproar, a decree was passed that the alli­ance with the Samnites should be renewed, and ambas­sadors sent for that purpose. This hasty proceedingsurprised the Samnites, who however insisted that theyshould not only give hostages, but also receive garri­sons into their fortified places ; and they, blinded byresentment, refused no terms. In a little time after,on the authors of the imposition removing to Taren-tum, the whole came to light. But as they had givenall power out of their own hands, nothing was leftthem but unavailing repentance.
28. This year proved as it were a new era of libertyto the Roman commons ; a stop being put to the prac­tice of confining debtors. This alteration1 of the lawwas effected in consequence of the behavior of a usurer,in which lust and cruelty were equally conspicuous.His name was Lucius Papirius. To him one CaiusPublilius having surrendered his person to be confinedfor a debt due by his father, his youth and beauty,which ought to have excited commiseration, operatedon the other's mind as incentives to barbarity. Hefirst attempted to seduce the young man by impurediscourses; but finding that his ears were shockedat their infamous tendency, he then endeavored toterrify him by threats, and reminded him frequently ofhis situation. At last, convinced of his resolution toact conformably to his honorable birth, rather than tohis present condition, he ordered him to be strippedand scourged. With the marks of the rods imprintedin his flesh the youth rushed out into the public street,uttering loud complaints of the depravedness and in­humanity of the usurer.

On account of the necessary delay, be­fore a peace could be concluded, it was also insistedon that six hundred horsemen should be given as hos­tages, who were to suffer death if the compact werenot fulfilled: a time was then fixed for delivering upthe hostages, and sending away the troops disarmed.The return of the consuls renewed the general grief inthe camp; insomuch, that the men hardly refrainedfrom offering violence to them; ' by whose rashness,'they said, ' they had been brought into such a situa­tion ; and through whose cowardice they were likelyto depart with greater disgrace than they came. Theyhad employed no guide who knew the country, norscouts to explore it; but went on blindly, like beastsinto a pitfall.' They cast looks of distraction on eachother; viewed earnestly the arms which they must pre­sently surrender; while their persons would be subjectto the will of the enemy : figured to themselves thehostile yoke, the scoffs of the conquerors, their haughtylooks, and, finally, thus disarmed, their march throughthe midst of an armed foe. In a word, they saw withhorror the miserable journey of their dishonored bandthrough the cities of the allies; and their return intotheir own country, to their parents, whither themselvesand their ancestors had so often come in triumph: ob­serving that ' they alone had been conquered withouta fight, without a weapon thrown, without a wound ;that they had not been permitted to draw their swordsagainst the enemy. In vain had arms, in vain hadstrength, in vain had courage, been given them.'While they were giving vent to such grievous reflec­tions the fatal hour of their disgrace arrived, whichwas to render every circumstance still more shockingin fact than they had preconceived it in their imagina­tions. First, they were ordered to go out, beyond therampart, unarmed, and with single garments; then thehostages were surrendered, and carried into custody:the lictors were next commanded to depart from the

the former or in opposition to the latter. On the con­trary, they had been informed that their countrymenwere expelled by the Roman people from the landsand out of the limits of Italy, compelled to pay tribute,and subjected to indignities of every kind.' To thesame application they received the same answer fromthe other assemblies in Gaul; nor did they meet anyvery friendly or peaceable reception until they arrivedat Marseilles. There, in consequence of the diligentinquiries made by those faithful allies, they learnedthat' the minds of the Gauls had been already prepos­sessed in favor of Hannibal: but that even he wouldfind that nation not very tractable, so ferocious andungovernable were their tempers, unless he frequentlyrevived the attachment of their chiefs with gold, ofwhich {hat people were remarkably greedy.' Havingthus finished their progress through the states of Spainand Gaul, the ambassadors returned to Rome, shortlyafter the consuls had set out for their provinces, andfound the passions of every man warmly excited bythe prospect of the approaching war, for all accountsnow agreed that the Carthaginians had passed theIberus.
21. Hannibal, after taking Saguntum, had retiredinto winter-quarters at New Carthage; where, receivinginformation of all the transactions and resolutions whichhad passed at Rome and at Carthage, and that he wasnot only the leader but likewise the cause of the war,he determined no longer to defer his measures; andhaving distributed and sold off the remains of theplunder, he called together his Spanish troops, andspoke to this effect: ' Fellow-soldiers, as we have al­ready established peace through all the states of Spain,we must either lay aside our arms, and disband ourforces, or transfer the seat of war to other countries :for the way to make these nations florish, with theblessings not only of peace but of victory, is for us toseek glory and spoil from others.

of a devoted consul: every part of (heir army had suf­fered great slaughter: their spearmen and their firstrank were cut to pieces; and, both before and behindtheir standards, multitudes were slain, until the vete­rans at last restored their cause. Now, although theforces of the Latines were reduced in an equal propor­tion, yet still, for the purpose of procuring reinforce­ments, either Latium, or the territory of the Volscians,was nearer than Rome. Wherefore, if they approvedof it, he would with all speed call out the youth fromthe states of the Latines and Volscians ; would marchback to Capua, with an army prepared for action, and,while the Romans thought of nothing less than a bat­tle, strike them with dismay by his unexpected arri­val.' The misrepresentations contained in his letters,which he despatched round Latium and the Volsciannation, were the more easily credited by the people,as they had not been present at the battle, and in con­sequence a tumultuary army levied in haste assembledfrom all quarters. This body the consul Torquatusmet at Trisanum, a place between Sinuessa and Min-turnaj. Withput waiting to choose ground for camps,both parties threw down their baggage in heaps, andimmediately began an engagement, which decided thefate of the war: for the strength of the Latines was sointirely broken fljat, on the consul leading his victo­rious army to ravage their country, they all submittedthemselves to his mercy, and their submission was fol­lowed by that of the Campanians. A forfeiture of aportion of their territory was exacted from Latium andCapua. The Latine lands, to which the Privernianwere added, and -also the Falernian, which had be­longed to the people of Campania, as far as the riverVulturnus, were distributed to the Roman commons.Of two acres, the portion allotted to each, three-fourthswere assigned them in the Latine ground, the comple­ment to be made up out of the Privernian.

the assailants; a crier was heard proclaiming, that' whoever laid down his arms might retire in safety.'This relaxed their eagerness in the fight, and theybegan almost every where to avail themselves of it.A part, more determined however, retaining their arms,rnshed out by the opposite gate, and found greatersafety in their boldness, than the others from the cre­dulity inspired by their fears ; for the Samnites sur­rounded the latter with fires, and burned them all todeath, while they made vain appeals to the faith ofgods and men. The consuls having settled the pro­vinces between them, Papirius proceeded into Apuliato Luceria, where the Roman horsemen, given as host­ages to Caudium, were kept in custody : Publiliusremained in Samnium to oppose the Caudine legions.This proceeding perplexed the minds of the Samnites :they could not safely determine either to go to Luceria,lest the enemy should press on their rear ; or to remainwhere they were, lest in the mean time Luceria shouldbe lost. They concluded therefore that it would be mostadvisable to trust to the decision of fortune, and totry the issue of a battle with Publilius: accordinglythey drew out their forces into the field.
13. When Publilius was about to engage, he thoughtit proper to address his soldiers; and accordingly heordered an assembly to be summoned. But thoughthey ran together to the general's quarters with thegreatest alacrity, yet so loud were their clamors, de­manding the fight, that none of the general's exhorta­tions were heard: each man's own reflections on thelate disgrace were sufficient to determine them. Theyadvanced therefore to battle, urging the standard-bearers to hasten; and lest in beginning the conflictthere should be any delay by reason that javelins wereless easily wielded than swords, they threw away theformer, as if a signal to that purpose had been given,and drawing the latter, rushed in full speed on the foe.The general had little opportunity of showing his skillin forming ranks or reserves; the ungoverned troopsperformed all, with a degree of fury little inferior to

ceedings were then directed towards Rome: by con­struing the order of the senate to have meant that in­quiry should be made, not specially who at Capua,but generally, who at any place had formed cabalsor conspiracies; for that cabals, for the attaining ofhonors were contrary to the edicts of the state. Theinquiry was extended to a greater latitude, with re­spect bQth to the matter, and to the kind of personsconcerned. The dictator scrupled not to avow thathis power of research was unlimited : in consequence,some of the nobility were called to account; andthough they applied to the tribunes for protection, noone interposed iu their behalf, or to prevent the charges1 from being received. On this the nobles, not thoseonly against whom the charge was levelled, but thewhole body jointly insisted that such an imputationlay not against themselves, or their order, to whomthe way to honors lay open if not obstructed by fraud,but against the new men: so that even the dictatorand master of the horse, with respect to that question,would appear more properly as culprits than inquisi­tors ; and this they should know as soon as they wentout of office. This so deeply affected Maenius, whowas more solicitous about his character than his office,that he advanced into the assembly and spoke to thiseffect: ' Romans, of my past life you are all wit­nesses ; and this honorable office, which you conferredon me is in itself a testimony of my innocence. Forthe dictator, proper to be chosen for holding these in­quiries, was not, as on many other occasions, where theexigences of the state so required, the man who wasmost renowned in war; but him whose course of lifewas most remote from such cabals.

Some men of advanced age, governors of theirforts, came to the Carthaginian as ambassadors, withhumble representations, that ' as the calamities ofothers had afforded them a profitable lesson, theywished to make trial of the friendship, rather than ofthe strength of the Carthaginians. That they weretherefore resolved to yield obedience to all his com­mands, and requested him to accept of provisions andguides on his march, and hostages to insure the per­formance of their engagements.' Hannibal neitherhastily crediting, nor yet slighting their offers, lest, ifrejected, they might declare openly against him, afterreturning a favorable answer, accepted the hostages,and made use of the provisions which they had, of theirown accord, brought to the road ; but followed theguides, not as through a friendly country, but withthe strictest order in his march. The elephants andcavalry composed the van, and he himself followedwith the main body of the infantry, carefully inspect­ing every particular. On their coming into a roadnarrower than the rest, confined on one side by animpending hill, the barbarians rising up on all sidesfrom places where they had lain concealed, assailedthem in front and rear, in close and in distant fight,rolling down also huge rocks on the troops. The mostnumerous body pressed on the rear. There the mainforce of infantry was ready to oppose them ; but hadnot that been very strong, it must undoubtedly, in sucha difficult pass, have suffered very great loss : even aathe case stood, it was brought to the extremity of dan­ger, and almost to destruction : for whilst Hannibalhesitated to lead down his horsemen into the narrowroad, though he had left no kind of support at the backof the infantry, the mountaineers, rushing across andbreaking through between the two divisions of thearmy, took possession of the pass, and Hannibal spentone night separated from his cavalry and baggage.

This I cannotaver as certain, because Piso, a more ancient writer ofannals, asserts that the curule ediles of that year wereCaius Doinitius Calvinus, son of Cneius, and SpuriusCarvilius Maximus, son of Caius. I am of opinionthat this latter surname caused a mistake concerningthe ediles ; and that thence followed a story, conform­able to this mistake, patched up out of the two elec­tions of the ediles and of the consuls. The generalsurvey was performed this year by Publius Sempro-nius Sophus and Publius Sulpicius Saverio, censors;and two tribes were added, the Aniensian and Teren-tine. Such were the occurrences at Roige1^

Meanwhile, after much time had' been lost inthe tedious siege of Nequinum, two of the townsmen,whose houses were contiguous to the wall, havingformed a subterraneous passage, came by that privateway to the Roman advanced guards; and, being con­ducted thence to the consul, offered to give admittanceto a body of armed men within the works and walls.The proposal was thought to be such as ought neitherto be rejected, nor yet assented to without caution.' With one of these men, the other being detained as ahostage, two spies were sent through the mine; andcertain information being received from them of thepracticability of the design, three hundred men inarms, guided by the deserter, entered the city, andseized by night the nearest gate ; which being brokenopen, the Roman consul and his army took possessionof the city without any opposition. In this, mannercame Nequinum under the dominion of the Romanpeople.

to them. The Tiburtians and Pranestians were amercedin a portion of their lands; not merely on account oftheir recent crime of rebellion, common to them withthe rest of the Latines, but because they had formerly,in disgust at the Roman government, associated inarms with the Gauls, a nation of savages. From theother states they took away the privileges of intermar­riage, commerce, and holding assemblies. To theCampanians, in compliment to their horsemen, whohad refused to join in rebellion with the Latines, aslikewise to the Fundans and Formians, because thetroops had always found a safe and quiet passagethrough their territories, the freedom of the state wasgranted, without right of suffrage. The states of Cu-mae and Suessula, it was decreed, should be placed onthe same footing, and enjoy the same privileges, asCapua. Of the ships of the Antians, some were drawnup into the docks at Rome ; the rest were burned, andwith the prows of these a pulpit, built in the forum,was ordered to be decorated, hence called rostra.1

Place before your eyesthe islands jEgates and Eryx, the calamities which youunderwent on land and sea, during the space of twenty-four years; nor were your troops then led by this boy,but by his father Hamilcar, another Mars, as those menchoose to call him. But at that time we had not, as wewere bound by treaty, avoided interfering with Taren-tum in Italy, as at present we do not avoid interferingwith Saguntum. Wherefore gods and men united toconquer us, and the question which words could notdetermine, ' Which of the nations had infringed thetreaty?' the issue of the war made known, as an equi­table judge, giving victory to that side on which justicestood. Hannibal is now raising works and towersagainst Carthage; with his battering rams he is shakingthe walls of Carthage. The ruins of Saguntum (oh !that I may prove a false prophet!) will fall on ourheads: and the war commenced against the Saguntinesmust be maintained against the Romans. Some willsay, ' Shall we then deliver up Hannibal?' I am sensi­ble that, with respect to him, my authority is of littleweight, on account of the enmity between me and hisfather. But as I rejoiced at the death of Hamilcar,for this reason, that had he lived, we should now havebeen embroiled in a war with the Romans, so do I hateand detest this youth as a fury and a firebrand kindlingthe like troubles at present. Nor is it my opinion,merely, that he ought to be delivered up, as an expia­tion for the infraction of the treaty, but that, if no onedemanded him, he ought to be conveyed away to theremotest coasts, whence no accounts of him, nor evenhis name, should ever reach us, and where he wouldnot be able to disturb the tranquillity of our state.

those who had with difficulty gained the walls, themost formidable obstruction, in their way, fought withease on equal ground against an enemy inferior instrength, they all forsook the towers and strongholds,and were driven to the forum. There for a short timethey tried, as a last effort, to retrieve the fortune ofthe fight; but, soon throwing down their arms, sur­rendered to the consul, to the number of fifteen thou­sand four hundred ; four thousand three hundred andeighty being slain. Such was the course of events atdom1nium ; such at Aquilonia. In the middle spacebetween the two cities, where a third battle had beenexpected, the enemy were not found ; for, when theywere within seven miles of Cominium, they were re­called by their countrymen, and had no part in eitherbattle. At night-fall.when they were now within sightof their camp, nnd also of Aquilonia, shouts from bothplaces reaching them with equal violence, inducedthem to halt: then, on the side of the camp which hadbeen set on fire by the Romans, the wide-spreadingflames discovered with more certainty the disasterwhich had happened, and prevented their proceedingany farther. In that same spot, stretched on the groundat random nnder their arms, they passed the wholenight in great inquietude, at one time wishing for, atanother dreading the light. At the first dawn, whilethey were still undetermined to what quarter theyshould direct their march, they were obliged (unpro­tected as they were either by a rampart or advancedguard) to betake themselves hastily to flight, beingdescried by the cavalry who had gone in pursuit of theSamnites that left the town in the night. These hadlikewise been perceived from the wails of Aquilonia,and the legionary cohorts now joined in the pursuit.The foot were unable to, overtake them, but the cavalrycut off about two hundred and eighty of their rearguard.

Nay, the bodyof the people themselves, whose power is supreme inevery case, never suffered their passions to carry themto greater severity, even towards those who, throughrashness and ignorance, had occasioned the I09S ofarmies, than the fining them a sum of money. Untilthat day a capital prosecution for ill conduct in warhad never been instituted against any commander, butnow, generals of the Roman people, after gaining themost splendid victories, and meriting the most honor­able triumphs, are threatened with rods and axes ; atreatment which would not have been deemed allow­able, even towards those who had been defeated by anenemy. What degree of punishment would his sonhave been liable to, if he had occasioned the loss ofthe army ? if he had been put to fight, and driven outof his camp? Could the dictator stretch his resentmentand violence to- any greater length than to scourgehim, and put him to death? How was it consistentwith reason that, through the means of Quintus Fa-bius, the state should be filled with joy, exulting invictory, and occupied in thanksgivings and congratu­lations ; while, at the same time, he who had givenoccasion to the temples of the gods being thrown open,their altars yet smoking with sacrifices, and loadedwith honors and offerings, should be stripped naked,and torn with stripes in the sight of the Roman peo­ple, within view of the capitol and citadel, and ofthose gods, whose aid he had so successfully invokedin two different battles?

Cornelius was left in Samnium. Marcius returnedinto the city in triumph over the Hernicians; and adecree was passed for erecting to him in the forum anequestrian statue, which was placed before the temple' of Castor. To three states of the Hernicians (theAlatrians, Verulans, and Ferentines,) their own lawswere restored, because they preferred these to thebeing made citizens of Rome ; and they were per­mitted to intermarry with each other, a privilegewhich they alone, of the Hernicians, for a long timeafter, enjoyed. To the Anagnians and the others,who had made war on the Romans, was granted thefreedom of the state, without the right of voting ; pub­lic assemblies and intermarriages were not allowedthem, and their magistrates were prohibited from act­ing except in the ministration of public worship. Du­ring this year Cains Junius Bubulcus, censor, con­tracted for the building of a temple to Health, whichhe had vowed during his consulate in the war with theSamnites. By the same person and his colleague,Marcus Valerius Maximus, roads were made throughthe fields at the public expense. During the same yearthe treaty with the Carthaginians was renewed a thirdtime, and ample presents made to their ambassadorswho came on that business.
44. This year had a dictator in office, Publius Cor­nelius Scipio, with Publius Decius Mus, master of thehorse. By these the election of consuls was held, beingthe purpose for which they had been created, becauseneither of the consuls could be absent from the armies.The consuls elected were Lucius Postumius and TitusMinucius [A.U.C. 448. B.C. 304] ; whom Piso placesnext after Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius, omittingthe two years in which I have set down Claudius withVolumnius, and Cornelius with Marcius, as consuls.Whether this happened through a lapse of memory indigesting his annals, or whether he purposely passedover those two consulates as deeming the accounts ofthem false, cannot be ascertained.

battles were fought, at times and places unfavorable,and increasing confidence rendered the enemy dailymore formidable ; so that matters came nearly to sucha state, as that neither could the soldiers rely much ontheir leader, nor the leader on his soldiers. It ap?-pears in three several histories that a letter was sentby the consul to call his colleague from Samnium.But I will not affirm what requires stronger proofs,that point having been disputed between these twoconsuls, a second time associated in the same office,Appius denying that he sent any such, and Volumniusaffirming that he was called thither by a letter fromhim. Volumnius had by this time taken three fortsin Samnium, in which three thousand of the enemyhad been slain, and about half that number made pri­soners; and a sedition having been raised among theLucanians by the plebeians, and the more indigent ofthe people, be had, to the great satisfaction of thenobles, quelled it by sending thither Quintus Fabius,proconsul, with his own veteran army. He left toDecius the ravaging of the country, and proceededwith his troops into Etruria to his colleague, whereon his arrival the army in general received him withjoy. Appius, if he did not write the letter, being con­scious of this, had, in my opinion, just ground of dis­pleasure : but if he had actually sent for assistance,his disowning it, as he did, arose from an illiberal andungrateful mind : for on going out to receive him,when they had scarcely exchanged salutations, hesaid, ' Is all well, Lucius Volumnius? How standaffairs in Samnium ? What motive induced you to re­move out of your province?' Volumnius answered, that' affairs in Samnium were in a prosperous state; andthat he had come thither in compliance with the re­quest in his letter. Cut if that were a forged letter,and that there was no occasion for him in Etruria, hewould instantly face about and depart.' ' You maydepart,' replied the other; ' no one detains you: forit is a perfect inconsistency, that when, perhaps, youare scarcely equal to the management of the war al­

who were to defend it, then Hannibal, seizing the op­portunity, sent about five hundred Africans, with pick­axes, to undermine the wall at the bottom ; which wasnot a difficult work, because the cement was not strength­ened with lime, but the interstices filled up with clay,according to the ancient method of building: otherparts of it therefore fell down, together with those towhich the strokes were applied, and through thesebreaches several bands of soldiers made their way intothe city. They likewise there took possession of aneminence, and collecting thither a number of enginesfor throwing darts and stones, surrounded it with awall, in order that they might have a fortress withinthe city itself, a citadel, as it were, to command it.The Saguntines on their part raised an inner wall be­tween that and the division of the city not yet taken.Both sides exerted themselves to the utmost, as well informing their works as in fighting. But the Saguntines,while they raised defences for the inner parts, con­tracted daily the dimensions of the city. At the sametime the scarcity of all things increased, in consequenceof the long continuance of the siege, while their ex­pectations of foreign aid diminished ; the Romans, theironly hope, being at so great a distance, and all thecountries round being in the hands of the enemy.However, their sinking spirits were for a short timerevived by Hannibal setting out suddenly on an expe­dition against the Oretans and Carpetans: for thesetwo nations, being exasperated by the severity used inlevying soldiers, had, by detaining the commissaries,afforded room to apprehend a revolt; but receiving anunexpected check, from the quick exertions of Hanni­bal, they laid aside the design of insurrection.

or Samnite; and placing himself in the way of hismen, as they pressed in disorder towards the camp,denounced threats to the same purport: ' Whither areyou going, soldiers?' said he; 'here also yon willfind both men and arms ; nor while your consul livesshall you pass the rampart, unless you bring victoryalong with you. Choose therefore which you willprefer, fighting against your own countrymen, or theenemy.' While the consul was thus speaking thecavalry gathered round, with the points of their spearspresented, and ordered the infantry to return to thefight. Not only his own brave spirit, but fortune like­wise aided the consul, for the Samnites did not pushtheir advantage ; so that he had time to wheel roundhis battalions, and to change his front from the camptowards the enemy. The men then began to encourageeach other to return to the battle, while the centurionssnatched the ensigns from the standard-bearers andbore them forward, pointing out to the soldiers theenemy, coming on in a hurry, few in number, and withtheir ranks disordered. At the same time the consul,with his hands lifted up towards heaven, and raisinghis voice so as to be heard at a distance, vowed atemple to Jupiter Stator if the Roman army shouldrally from flight, and renewing the battle, defeat theSamnites. All divisions of the army now united theirefforts to restore the fight ; officers, soldiers, in shortthe whole force, both of cavalry and infantry ; eventhe gods seemed to have looked with favor on the Ro­man causes so speedily was a thorough change effectedin the fortune of the day, the enemy being repulsedfrom the camp, and in a short time driven back to thespot where the battle had commenced. Here theystopped, being obstructed by the heap of baggagelying in their way, where they had thrown it toge­ther ; and then to prevent the plundering of their ef­fects, formed round them a circle of troops.

their recent ravages ; and the people of that town in­formed him that the enemy carried with them such aquantity of spoil, that they could scarcely observe anyorder in their march ; and that the commanders thendirected publicly that the troops should go immedi­ately to Samnium, deposit the booty there, and returnto the business of the expedition, as an engagementmust not be hazarded while they were so heavilyladen. Notwithstanding that this account carriedevery appearance of truth, he yet thought it necessaryto obtain more certain information: accordingly he de­spatched some horsemen to seize on some of the strag­gling marauders: from these he learned, on inquiry,that the enemy lay at the river Vulturnus ; that theyintended to remove thence at the third watch ; andthat their route was towards Samnium. On receivingthis intelligence, which could be depended on, he puthis troops in motion, and sat down at such a distancefrom the enemy, as was sufficient to prevent their dis­covering his approach, and, at the same time, left it inhis power to surprise them, as they should be comingout of their camp. A long time before day he drewnigh to their post, and sent persons who understoodthe Oscan language, to discover how they were em­ployed : these, mixing with the enemy, which theycould easily do during the confusion in the night,found that the,standards had gone out thinly attended;that the booty, and those appointed to guard it, werethen setting out, a contemptible train : each busiedabout his own affairs, without any concert with therest, or much regard to orders. This the consuljudged the fittest lime for the attack; and, daylightnow approaching, he gave orders to sound the charge,and fell on the enemy as they were marching out.The Samnites being embarrassed with the spoil, andvery few armed, were at a loss how to act. Somequickened their pace, and drove the prey before them ;others baited, deliberating whether it would be saferto advance, or to return again to the camp ; and whilethey hesitated, they were overtaken and cut off.

bestowed by the dictators and consuls, and very few ofthe places were left to be filled by vote. This order wasproposed by Lucius Atilius and Caius Marcius, plebeiantribunes. Another was, that the people likewise shouldconstitute two naval commissioners, for the equippingand refitting of the fleet. The person who introducedthis order of the people was Marcus Decius, plebeiantribune. Another transaction of this year I should passover as trifling, were it not for the relation which itbears to religion. The flute players taking offence be­cause they had been prohibited, by the last censors,from holding their repasts in the temple of Jupiter,which had been customary from very early times, wentoff in a body to Tibur; so that there was not one leftin the city to play at the sacrifices. This affair gaveuneasiness to the senate on account of its consequencesto religion ; and they sent envoys to Tibur with in­structions, to endeavor that these men might be sentback to Rome. The Tiburtines readily promised com­pliance, and first calling them into the senate-house,warmly recommended to them to return thither; andthen, finding that they could not be prevailed on,practised an artifice not ill adapted to the dispositionsof that description of people: on a festival day, theyinvited them separately to their several houses, ap­parently with the intention of heightening the pleasureof their feasts with music, and there plied them withwine, of which such people are always fond, until theylaid them asleep. In this state of insensibility theythrew them into waggons, and carried them away toRome: nor did they know any thing of the matteruntil the wnggons having been left in the forum, thelight surprised them, still heavily sick from the de­bauch. The people then crowded about them, and, ontheir consenting at length to stay, privilege was grantedthem to ramble about the city in full dress, with music,during three days in every year. And that license,which we see practised at present, and the right ofbeing fed in the temple, was restored to those whoplayed at the sacrifices. These incidents occurred

on both sides, were used to steady combat, and to pre­serve their ranks. But the Macedonian phalanx wasunapt for motion, and composed of similar 'partsthroughout: the Roman line less compact, consistingof several various parts, was easily divided, as occa­sion required, and as easily conjoined. Then whatsoldier is comparable to the Roman in the throwingup of works ? who better calculated to endure fatigue?Alexander if overcome in one battle could make noother effort. The Roman, whom Caudium, whom.Cannae, did not crush, what fight could crush? Intruth, even should events have been favorable to himat first, he would have often wished for the Persians,the Indians, and the effeminate tribes of Asia, as op­ponents ; and would have acknowleged that bis warshad been waged with women, as we are told was saidby Alexander, king of Epirus, after receiving his mor­tal wound, in relation to the battles fought in Asia bythis very youth, and when compared with those inwhich himself had been engaged. Indeed, when I re­flect that in the first Punic war a contest was main­tained by the Romans with the Carthaginians at seafor twenty-four years, I can scarcely suppose that thelife of Alexander would have been long enough for thefinishing of one war with either of those nations. Andperhaps, as the Punic state was united to the Romanby ancient treaties, and as similar apprehensions mightarm against a common foe those two nations the mostpotent of the time, he might have been overwhelmed ina Punic and a Roman war at once. The Romans havehad experience of the boasted prowess of the Macedo­nians in arms, not indeed when they were led byAlexander, or when their power was at the height, butin the wars against Antiochus, Philip, and Perses;and so far were they from sustaining any losses, thatthey incurred not even danger.

Lu­cius Sextius was the first consul chosen out of theplebeians; Caius Licinius Stolo the first master of thehorse; Caius Marcius Rutilus the first dictator, andlikewise censor ; Quintus Publilius Philo the first pre-tor. On every one of these occasions was heard a re­petition of the same arguments: that the right of aus­pices was vested in you ; that you alone had the rightsof ancestry ; that you alone were legally intitled to thesupreme command, and the auspices both in peace andwar. The supreme command has hitherto been, andwill continue to be, equally prosperous in plebeianhands as in patrician. Have you never heard it saidthat the first created patricians were not men sent downfrom heaven, but such as could cite their fathers, thatis, nothing more than free born. I can now cite myfather, a consul; and my son will be able to cite agrandfather. Citizens, their opposition means nothingelse than that we should never obtain any thing with­out a previous refusal.

46. In the same year Caius Flavius, son of Cneius,grandson of a freedman, a notary, in low circumstancesoriginally, but artful and eloquent, was appointedcurule edile. I find in some annals that, being in at­tendance on the ediles, and seeing that he was votededile by the prerogative tribe, but that his name wouldnot be received, because he acted as a notary, he threwdown his tablet, and took an oath that he would not,for the future, follow that business. But Licinius Ma-cer contends that he had dropped the employment ofnotary a considerable time before, having already beena tribune, and twice a triumvir, once for regulating thenightly watch, and another time for conducting a co­lony. However, of this there is no dispute, that to thecontempt thrown by the nobles on the meanness of hiscondition, he opposed much firmness. He made publicthe rules of proceeding injudicial causes, hitherto shutup in the closets of the pontiffs; and hung up to publicview, round the forum, the calendar on white tablets,that all might know when business could be transactedin the courts. To the great displeasure of the nobles,he performed the dedication of the temple of Concord,in the area of Vulcan's temple ; and the chief pontiff',Cornelius Barbatus, was compelled by the united in­stances of the people, to dictate to him the form ofwords, although he affirmed that, consistently with thepractice of antiquity, no other than a consul, or com­mander-in-chief, could dedicate a temple.

The adjacent country is inhabited by theAllobroges; a nation, even in those times, inferior tonone in Gaul in power and reputation, but at thatjuncture weakened by discord. Two brothers dis­puted the sovereignty. The elder, who had been in­vested with the government, by name Brancus, wasdispossessed by the younger brother, and a combina­tion of the younger men ; on which side, though therewas less justice, there was more strength. Most op­portunely, the parties in this dissension referred theirpretensions to the judgment of Hannibal, who beingappointed arbitrator of the disputed'sovereignty, gavea decision agreeable to the sense of the senate, and ofthe principal men in the state : that the governmentshould be restored to the elder. In requital of whichfavor, he was assisted with a supply of provisions, andplenty of all kind of necessaries, particularly of cloth­ing, which the terrible accounts of the cold of thehigher regions made it necessary to provide. Aftersettling the disputes of the Allobroges, though nowbent on proceeding to the Alps, he took not the directroad thither, but turned to the left into the country ofthe Tricastines ; thence, through the extreme bounda­ries of the Vocontian territory, he advanced into thatof the Tricorians, meeting no obstruction until he^cameto the river Druentia. This also, deriving its sourcefrom the Alps, is, of all the rivers in Gaul, the mostdifficult to pass ; for though conveying a vast body ofwater, it admits not the use of ships ; because, beingconfined by no banks, it flows in several, and not al­ways the same channels, continually forming new shal­lows, and new whirlpools, so that a person is in dan­ger of missing his way ; and besides rolling down loosegritty stones, the footing is unsteady.

But neither did these holdthe elections: and the people being dissatisfied withall the magistrates of that year, an interregnum en­sued. The office of interrex was held by Quintus Fa-bius Maximus; afterwards by Marcus Valerius Cor-vus, who elected consuls Quintus Publilius Philo, andLucius Papirius Cursor a second time [A. U.

They entered into office immediately on beingelected, for so it had been determined by the fathers.When the customary decrees of the senate were passedthey proposed the consideration of the Caudine peace;and Publilius, whose duty it was to open the business,said, ' Spurius Postumius, speak.' He arose with justthe same countenance with which he had passed underthe yoke, and delivered himself to this effect: ' Con­suls, doubtless I am to be called up first with markedignominy, not with honor; and am ordered to speak,not as being a senator, but as a person who has to an­swer for an unsuccessful war and disgraceful peace.However, the question propounded by you is not con­cerning our guilt or our punishment: waving there­fore a defence, which would not be very difficult beforemen who are not unacquainted with the casualties towhich mankind are subject, I shall briefly state myopinion on the matter in question; which opinion willtestify whether I was actuated by tenderness to myselfor to your legions, when I engaged as surety to theconvention, be it of what kind it may, whether disho­norable or necessary : by which, however, the Romanpeople are not bound, inasmuch as it was concludedwithout their order; nor is any thing liable to be for­feited to the Samnites, in consequence of it, except ourpersons.

night, or at all events at the dawn of day, to attack theenemy's camp.' The Roman troops, though not lesseager for action, were restrained by the commands ofthe general. About the tenth hour the consul orderedhis men a repast, and gave directions that they shouldbe ready in arms at whatever time of the day or nighthe should give the signal. He then addressed a fewwords to them ; spoke in high terms of the wars of theSamnites, and contemptuously of the Etrurians, who' were not,' he said, ' to be compared with other na­tions, either in respect of abilities as soldiers or inpoint of numbers. Besides, he had an engine at work,as they should find in due time : at present it was ofimportance to keep it secret.' This he intimated inorder to raise the courage of his men, damped by thesuperiority of the enemy's force ; and, from their nothaving fortified the post where they lay, the insinua­tion of a stratagem formed against them seemed themore credible. After refreshing themselves they wentto rest; and being roused without noise, about thefourth watch, took arms. The servants following thearmy had axes put into their ha'nds, to tear down therampart and fill up the trench. The line was formed,within the works, and some chosen cohorts posted closeto the gates. Then, a little before day, which in sum­mer nights is the time of the profoundest sleep, thesignal being given, the rampart was levelled, and thetroops rushing forth, fell on the enemy, who wereevery where stretched at their length. Some were putto death before they could stir; others, half asleep intheir beds; the greatest part, while they ran in confu­sion to arms; few, in short, had time to defend them­selves ; and those who followed no particular leader,nor orders, were quickly routed and pursued by theRoman horse. They fled different ways; to the campand to the woods. The latter afforded the safer re­fuge ; for the former, being situated in a plain, wastaken the same day.

sessed, laid themselves out to make friends of theGauls instead of enemies ; in order that, with theirarmies combined, they might attack the Romans. Thebarbarians made no objection to the alliance, and anegotiation was opened for settling the price; whichbeing adjusted and paid, the Etrurians, having everything else in readiness for commencing their opera­tions, desired them to accompany them in their march.But this they refused, alleging that ' they had stipu­lated a price for their assistance against the Romans :that the payment already made they had received inconsideration of their not wasting the Etrurian terri­tory, or using their arms against the inhabitants: that,notwithstanding, if it was the wish of the Etrurians,they were still willing to engage in the war; but on noother condition than that of being allowed a share oftheir lands, and obtaining at length some permanentsettlement.' Many assemblies of the states of Etruriawere held on this subject without being able to cometo any conclusion ; not so much by reason of theiraversion from the,dismemberment of their territory asof the dread which every one felt of the consequences,if they should fix in so close vicinity to themselvespeople of such a savage race. The Gauls were there­fore dismissed, and carried home an immense sum ofmoney, acquired without toil or danger. The reportof a Gallic tumult, in addition to an Etrurian war, hadcaused serious apprehensions at Rome; and, with theless hesitation on that account, an alliance was con­cluded with the state of the Picentians.

Qnintus Aulius, came hither with a new army fromRome; and having, by messengers whom he sent for­ward, consulted the dictator where he should halt, atwhat time, and on what side, he should fall on theenemy, and being sufficiently apprised of his designsin every particular, he rested in a place where he wassafe from observation. The dictator, after having kepthis men within the rampart for several days after theengagement, like one besieged rather than a besieger,suddenly displayed the signal for battle: and judgingit the more efficacious method of inflaming the courageof brave men to let none have any room for hope butin himself, he kept secret from the troops the arrivalof the master of the horse and the new army; and, asif there were no safety but in forcing their way thence,he said, ' Soldiers, caught as we are in a confined situ­ation, we have no passage through which we can extri­cate ourselves, unless we open one by a victory. Ourpost is sufficiently secured by works ; but, at the sametime, untenable through scarcity of necessaries; forall the country round, from which provisions could besupplied, has revolted ; and besides, even were the in­habitants disposed to aid us, the nature of the groundis unfavorable. I will not therefore mislead you byleaving a camp here, into- which you may retreat, ason a former day, without completing the victory.Works ought to be secured by arms, not arms byworks.

39. Hannibal had now a favorable opportunity forcommencing his operations; the Taurinians, the nationlying nearest in his way, being at war with the Insu-brians. But he could not put his forces under arms toassist either party, because they now felt most sen­sibly, while endeavoring to remedy them, the maladieswhich they had before contracted: for rest after toil,plenty after scarcity, and care of their persons after acourse of filth and nastiness, produced little effect inthe various disorders of those whose bodies were grownsqualid and filthy to a degree of brutality. This con­sideration induced the consul Publius Cornelius, assoon as he arrived with the fleet at Pisae, though thearmy which he received from Manlius and Atilius wascomposed of raw troops, and dispirited by their latedisgraces, to hasten to the Po, in order that he mightengage the enemy before he should recover his vigor.But by the time the consul came to Placentia, Hanni­bal had moved from his post, and had taken by storma city of the Taurinians, the metropolis of the nation,because it had refused an offer of his friendship; andhe would have drawn over to his side, either by theirfears or inclinations, all the Gauls dwelling near thePo, had riot the sudden arrival of Cornelius, whenthey were watching for an occasion of revolting, put astop to their measures. Hannibal likewise advancedtowards them from the country of the Taurinians, inexpectation that, as they had not yet resolved whatparty they would join, his presence might determinethem in his favor.

41. Fabius, in consideration of his extraordinarymerit in the conquest of Etruria, was re-elected intothe consulship. [A.U.C. 445. B.C. 307.] Decius wasappointed his colleague. Valerius was created pretora fourth time. The consuls divided the provinces be­tween them. Etruria fell to Decius ; Samnium to Fa-bins. The latter, having marched to Nuceria, rejectedthe application of the people of Alfaterna, who thensued for peace, because they had not accepted it whenoffered, and by force of arms compelled them to sur­render. A battle was fought with the Samnites, whowere overcome without much difficulty: nor would thememory of that engagement have been preserved, ex­cept that in it the Marsians first appeared in armsagainst the Romans. The defection of the Marsianswas followed by that of the Pelignians, who met thesame fate. The other consul, Decius, was likewisevery successful in his operations : through the terrorwith which he inspired the Tarquinians, he compelledthem to supply his army with corn, and to sue for atruce for forty years. He took several forts from theVolsinians by assault; some of which he demolished,that they might not serve as receptacles to the enemy;and, by extending his operations through every quar­ter, diffused such a dread of ljis arms, that the wholeEtrurian nation sued to him for an alliance: this theydid not obtain; but a truce for a year was grantedthem. The pay of the Roman army for that year wasfurnished by the enemy; and two tunics for each sol­dier were exacted from them : this was the purchaseof the truce. The tranquillity now established in Etru­ria was interrupted by a sudden insurrection of theUmbrians, a nation which had suffered no injury fromthe war, except what inconvenience the country hadfelt in the passing of the army. These, by calling intothe field all their young men, and forcing a great partof the Etrurians to resume their arms, made up such anumerous force, that speaking of themselves with os­tentatious vanity, and of the Romans with contempt,they boasted that they would leave Decius behind in

Had their reason beensound, would it have been difficult, during the timewhich they spent in sending for old men from home togive them advice to send ambassadors.to Rome, and tonegotiate a peace and treaty with the senate and withthe people?

The force of the war was then directed against theEtrurians ; and the dictator having gone to Rome, forthe purpose of renewing the auspices, the master ofthe horse, going out to forage, was taken at disadvan­tage, by means of an ambuscade, and obliged to flyshamefully into his camp, after losing several stand­ards and many of his men. Now, that such a discom­fiture happened to Fabius is exceedingly improbable ;not only because, if in any particular, certainly aboveall, in the qualifications of a commander, he fullymerited his surname ; but besides, impressed with therecollection of Papirius' severity, he never could havebeen tempted to fight without the dictator's orders.
4. The news of this disaster excited at Rome analarm greater than the importance of the affair shouldseem to justify ; for, as if the army had been destroyed,the courts were ordered to be shut, guards mounted atthe gates, and watches set in every street: and armorand weapons were heaped on the walls. All theyounger citizens were compelled to enlist, and the dic­tator was ordered to join the army. There he foundevery thing in a more tranquil state than he expected,aud regularity established, through the care of themaster of the horse; the camp removed to a place ofgreater safety ; the cohorts, which had lost their stan­dards, left without tents on the outside of the ram­parts; and the troops ardently impatient for battle,that their disgrace might be the sooner obliterated.He therefore immediately decamped, and advancedinto the territory of Rusella. Thither the enemy alsofollowed ; and although, since their late success, theyentertained the most sanguine hopes from an opentrial of strength, yet they endeavored to gain also anadvantage by a stratagem which they had before prac­tised with success. There were at a small distancefrom the Roman camp the half-ruined houses of atown which had been burnt in the devastation of thecountry. Among these they concealed a body oftroops, and then drove on some cattle within viewof a Roman post commanded by a lieutenant-general,

These, and otherarguments, were urged in vain by the tribunes: theaffair ended in an interregnum.

Historians relate that, in this year, Alexandriain Egypt was founded; and that Alexander, king ofEpirus, being slain by a Lucanian exile, verified, inthe circumstances of his death, the prediction of Jupiterof Dodona. At the time when he was invited into Italyby the Tarentines he received a caution from that ora­cle, to beware of the Acherusian waters, and the cityPandosia, for there were fixed the limits of bis destiny:for that reason he made the greater haste to pass overto Italy, in order to be at as great a distance as pos­sible from the city Pandosia in Epirus, and the riverAcheron, which, after flowing through Molossis, winsinto the lakes called Infernal, and is received into theThesprotian gulf. But, as it frequently happens thatmen, by endeavoring to shun their fate, run directlyon it, after having often defeated the armies of Brut-tium and Lucania, and taken Heraclea, a colony of theTarentines, Potentia, and Metapontum from the Luca-nians, Terina from the Bruttians, and several othercities of the Messapians and Lucanians; and havingsent into Epirus three hundred illustrious families,whom he intended to keep as hostages, he posted histroops on three hills, which stood at a small distancefrom each other, not far from the city Pandosia, andclose to the frontiers of the Bruttians and Lucanians, inorder that he might thence make incursions into everypart of the enemy's country.

46. The snow had now intirely covered the face ofthe country, and rendered the shelter of houses abso­lutely necessary: the consul therefore led home histroops from Samnium. While he was on his way toRome a triumph was decreed him with universal con­sent : and accordingly he triumphed while in office,and with extraordinary splendor, considering the cir­cumstances of those times. The cavalry and infantrymarched in the procession, adorned with the honorablepresents which they had received. Great numbers ofcrowns were seen, which had been bestowed as marksof honor, for having saved the lives of citizens, or forhaving first mounted walls or ramparts. People's cu­riosity was highly gratified in viewing the spoils of theSamnites, and comparing them, in respect of magni­ficence and beauty, with those taken by his father,which were well known, from being frequently exhi­bited as ornaments of the public places. Several pri­soners of distinction, renowned for their own exploits,and; those of their ancestors, were led in the cavalcade.There were carried in the train two millions and thirty-three thousand asses in weight,1 said to be producedby the sale of the prisoners ; and of silver, taken inthe. cities, one thousand three hundred and thirtypounds. All the silver and brass were lodged in thetieasury, no share of this part of the spoil being givento the soldiers. The ill humor which this excited inthe commons was farther exasperated by their beingobliged to contribute by a tax to the payment of thearmy ; whereas, said they, if the vain parade of con­veying the produce of the spoil to the treasury hadbeen disregarded, donations might have been made tothe soldiers, and the pay of the army also supplied outof that fund.

of the son, the command was held by Hasdrubal;whom, it was said, Hamilcar had first chosen as a fa-rorite, on account of his youthful beauty, and after­wards made him his son-in-law, on account of his emi­nent abilities; in consequence of which connexion,being supported by the interest of the Barcine faction,which among the army and the commons was exceed­ingly powerful, he was invested with the command inchief, in opposition to the wishes of the nobles. Heprosecuted his designs more frequently by means ofpolicy than of force ; and augmented the Carthaginianpower considerably by forming connexions with thepetty princes ; and, through the friendship of theirleaders, conciliating the regard of nations hithertostrangers. But peace proved no security to himself.One of the barbarians, in resentment of his masterhaving been put to death, openly assassinated him,and being seized by the persons present, showed nokind of concern ; nay, even while racked with tor­tures, as if his exultation, at having effected his pur­pose, had got the better of the pains, the expressionof his countenance was such as carried the appearanceof a smile. With this Hasdrubal, who possessed a sur­prising degree of skill in negotiation, and in attachingforeign nations to his government, the Romans renewedthe treaty, on the terms that the river Iberus shouldbe the boundary of the two empires, and that the Sa-guntines, who lay between them, should retain theirliberty.
3. There was no room to doubt that the suffrages ofthe commons, in appointing a successor to Hasdrubal,would follow the direction pointed out by the leadingvoice of the army, who had instantly carried youngHannibal to the head-quarters, and with one consent,and universal acclamations, saluted him general. Thisyouth, when scarcely arrived at the age of manhood,Hasdrubal had invited by letter to come to him ; andthat affair bad even been taken into deliberation in thesenate, where the Barcine faction showed a desire thatHannibal should be accustomed to military service,

then four augurs and four pontiffs, and it had heen de­termined that the number of priests should be aug­mented, the four additional pontiffs and five augursshould all be chosen out of the commons. How thecollege of augurs could be reduced to the number offour, except by the death of two, I do not understand ;for it is a rule among the augurs that their numbershould be composed of threes, so that the three ancienttribes, the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, shouldhave each its own augur; or, in case there should beoccasion for more, that each should increase its num­ber of augurs in equal proportion with the rest, in likemariner as when, by the addition of five to four, theymade up the number nine, so that there were three toeach tribe. However, as it was proposed that theyshould be chosen out of the commons, the patricianswere as highly offended at the proceeding as whenthey saw the consulship made common ; yet they pre­tended that the business concerned not them so muchas it did the gods, ' who would take care that their ownworship should not be contaminated ; that, for theirparts, they only wished that no misfortune might en­sue to the commonwealth.' But the true reason oftheir not making a vigorous opposition was, that theywere now accustomed to suffer defeat in such kind ofdisputes ; and they saw their adversaries, not as for­merly, grasping at objects which they could scarcelyhope to reach, the higher honors; but already in pos­session of all those advantages, on the uncertain pros­pect of which they had maintained the contest, mani­fold consulships, censorships, and triumphs.

There was, however, a struggle between the sup­porters and the opponents of the law, maintained prin­cipally by Appius Claudius and Publius Decius Mus.After these had urged nearly the same topics respect­ing the privileges of patricians and plebeians, whichhad been formerly employed for and against the Lici-nian law, when the proposition was brought forwardof opening the consulship to plebeians, Decius is saidto have drawn a lively description of his own father,

This ef­fectually deceived not only the Samnites but the Ro­mans themselves: and the consul confirmed the mis­take by calling out, among the foremost battalions, sothat his voice reached also the enemy, that ' Cominiumwas taken ; and that his victorious colleague was ap­proaching :' bidding his men ' now make haste to com­plete the defeat of the enemy before the other armyshould come in for a share of the glory.' This he saidas he sat on horseback, and then ordered the tribunesand centurions to open passages for the horse. Hehad given previous directions to Trebonius and Caedi-cius that, when they should see him waving the pointof his spear aloft, they should cause the cavalry tocharge the enemy with all possible violence. Everyparticular, as previously concerted, was executed withthe utmost exactness. The passages were opened be­tween the ranks; the cavalry darted through; and,with the points of their spears presented, rushed intothe midst of the enemy's battalions, breaking down theranks wherever they charged. Volumnius and Scipioseconded the blow, and, taking advantage of the ene­my's disorder, made a terrible slaughter. Thus at­tacked, the cohorts called linteatae, regardless of allrestraints from either gods or men, quitted their postsin confusion ; the sworn and the unsworn all fled alike,no longer dreading aught but the Romans. The re­mains of their infantry were driven into the camp atAquilonia. The nobility and cavalry directed theirflight to Bovianum. The horse were pursued by theRoman horse, the infantry by their infantry, while thewings proceeded by different roads; the right to thecamp of the Samnites, the left to the city.

Samnites, war is just when itbecomes necessary, and arms are clear of impiety whenmen have no hope left but in arms. Wherefore, as theissue of every human undertaking depends chiefly onmen's acting either with or without the favor of thegods, be assured that the former wars you waged inopposition to the gods more than to men ; in this, whichwe are now to undertake, you will act under the im­mediate guidance of the gods themselves.'' 2. After uttering these predictions, not more favor­able than true, he led out the troops, and placed hiscamp about Caudium, as much out of view as possible.From thence he sent to Calatia, where he heard thatthe Roman consuls were encamped, ten soldiers, in thehabit of shepherds, and ordered them to keep somecattle feeding in several different places, at a small dis­tance from the Roman posts; and that, when they fellin with any of their foragers, they should all agree inthe same story, that the legions of the Samnites werethen in Apulia, besieging Luceria with their wholeforce, and very near becoming masters of it. Such arumor had been industriously spread before, and hadalready reached the Romans; but these prisoners causedthem to give it greater credit, especially as they allconcurred in the same report. The Romans did nothesitate to resolve on carrying succor to the Lucerians,because they were good and faithful allies ; and for thisfarther reason, lest all Apulia, through apprehensionof the impending danger, might go over to the enemy.The only point which came under deliberation was, bywhat road they should go.

Hannibal ordered them to be driven away from thecentre towards the extremity of the left wing againstthe auxiliary Gauls. These they instantly put to openflight, which spread new terror among the Romans.They were now obliged to fight in the form of a circle;when about ten thousand of them, having no othermeans of escape, forced their way, with great slaugh­ter, through the centre of the African line, which wascomposed of the Gallic auxiliaries ; and as they couldneither return to their camp, from which they wereshut out by the river, nor, by reason of the heavyrain, discover in what part they could assist theirfriends, they proceeded straight to Placentia. Afterthis several similar irruptions were made from allquarters; and those who pushed towards the river wereeither drowned in the eddies, or, hesitating to enterthe water, were cut off. Some, who in their flightdispersed themselves over the country, falling in withthe tracks of the body of troops which had retreated,followed them to Placentia ; others, from their fears ofthe enemy, assumed boldness to attempt the stream,and, accomplishing their passage, arrived at the camp.The rain, mixed with snow, and the intolerable seve­rity of the cold, destroyed great numbers of men andhorses, and almost all the elephants. The Carthagi­nians continued the pursuit no farther than the riverTrebia, and returned to their camp so benumbed withthe cold, as to be scarcely capable of feeling joy forthe victory ; insomuch that though, during the follow­ing night, the guard of the Roman camp, and a greatpart at least of their soldiers, passed the Trebia onrafts, the Carthaginians either perceived nothing of thematter through the noise made by the fain, or being,by weariness and wounds, disabled to move, pretendedthat they did not perceive it; and 4b.e enemy lyingquiet, the consul Scipio led the troops in silence toPlacentia, and thence across the Po to Cremona, lestthe two armies, wintering in one colony, should be toogreat a burden.

As all the authors donot concur in mentioning his death to have ensued, I,for my part, must leave that circumstance in doubt; asI shall another, of a violent storm, with dreadful noisein the air, happening while appeals were made to thegods concerning the infraction of the treaties: for, asthese accounts may possibly be founded in fact, so maythey likewise have been invented to express, in a livelymanner, an immediate denunciation of the wrath of thegods. Torquatus being sent by the senate to dismissthe ambassadors, on seeing Annius stretched on theground, exclaimed, in a voice so loud as to be heardboth by the senators and the people, ' Ye gods, pro­ceed in so just a war, in which your own rights areconcerned; there is a deity in heaven ; thou dost exist,great Jupiter ; not without reason have we consecratedyou, in this mansion, as the father of gods and men.Why do you hesitate, Romans, and you, conscriptfathers, to take up arms, when the gods thus lead theway? Thus will I throw down in the dust the legionsof the Latines, as you see their ambassador prostrated.'These words of the consul were received by the multi­tude with applause, and excited such a flame in theirbreasts, that the ambassadors at their departure owedtheir safety rather to the care of the magistrates, whoescorted them by the consul's order, than to the people'sregard to the laws of nations. The senate concurredin voting for the war; and the consuls, after raisingtwo armies, marched through the territories of theMarsians and Pelignians; and, having formed a junc­tion with the army of the Samnites, pitched their campin the neighborhood of Capua, where the Latines andtheir allies had already collected their forces.- Here,as it is related, there appeared to both the consuls, intheir sleep, the same figure of a man, of a form larger,and more majestic, than the human, who said to them,that' of the one party a general, of the other the army,were-due as victims to the infernal gods and to motherearth; and that on whichever side a general should

To this Volumnius rejoined, ' MayHercules direct all for the hest! for his part, he wasbetter pleased that he had taken useless trouble, thanthat any conjuncture should have arisen which badmade one consular army insufficient for Etruria.'
19. As the consuls were parting, the lieutenants-general and tribunes of Appius' army gathered roundthem. Some intreated their own general that hewould not reject the voluntary offer of his colleague'sassistance, which he ought to have solicited: thegreater number used their endeavors to stop Volum­nius, beseeching him ' not, through a peevish disputewith his colleague, to abandon the interest of the com­monwealth ; and represented to him that in case anymisfortune should happen, the blame would fall on theperson who forsook the other, not on the one forsaken ;that the state of affairs was such, that the credit anddiscredit of every success and failure in Etruria wouldbe attributed to Lucius Volumnius : for .no one wouldinquire what were the words of Appius, but what thesituation of the army. Appius indeed had dismissedhim, but the commonwealth and the army required hisstay. Let him only make trial of the inclinations ofthe soldiers.' By such admonitions and intreatiesthey, in a manner, dragged the consuls to an assembly.There, longer discourses were made to the same pur­port, as had passed before in the presence of a few.As Volumnius had the advantage of the argument, so- did he show himself not deficient in oratory, in despiteof the extraordinary eloquence of his colleague. Onwhich Appius observed with a sneer, that' they oughtto acknowlege themselves indebted to him, in having aconsul, who, among his other qualifications, possessedeloquence also, instead of being dumb and speechlessas he was in their former consulate; when, particu­larly during the first months, he was not able so muchas to open his lips ; but now, in his harangues, evenaspired after popularity.'

toriaos—that hardly ever was any general seen in thefield with a more cheerful countenance ; whether thiswas owing to his natural temper or to his confidenceof success. From the same firmness of mind it pro­ceeded that he did not suffer himself to be divertedfrom the war by the dispute about the auspices; andthat, in the heat of the battle, when it was customaryto vow temples to the immortal gods, he vowed to Jo-piter the victorious, that if he should defeat the le­gions of the enemy, he would, before he tasted of anygenerous liquor, make a libation to him of a cup ofwine and hoaey. This kind of vow proved acceptableto the gods, and they conducted the auspices to a for­tunate issue.
43. Like success attended the operations of the otherconsul at Cominium : leading up his forces to the wallsat the first dawn, he invested the city on every sideiand posted strong guards opposite to the gates to pre­vent any sally being made. Just as he was giving thesignal, the alarming message from his colleague, touch­ing the march of the twenty Samnite cohorts, not onlycaused him to delay the assault, but obliged him to calloff a part of his troops when they were formed andready to begin the attack. He ordered Decjus Bru­tus Scaeva, a lieutenant-general, with the first legion,twenty auxiliary cohorts, and the cavalry, to go andoppose the said detachment; and in whatever place heshould meet the foe, there to stop and detain them,and even to engage in battle, should opportunity offerfor it: at all events, not to suffer those troops to ap­proach Cominium. He then commanded the scaling-ladders to be bronght up to the walls on every side ofthe city ; and, under a fence of closed shields, advancedto the gates. Thus, at the same moment, the gateswere broken open, and the assault made on every partof the rampart.

but, doubting their ability to repel the Carthaginianfrom the country on the hither side, in order to availthemselves of the river as a defence, they had trans­ported almost all their effects beyond it, and wereready in arms to defend the opposite bank. Hannibal,
' by means of presents, prevailed on the inhabitants ofthe other districts contiguous to the river, and even onthose of that very state who stayed in their own habi­tations, to collect ships from every quarter, and tobuild others ; themselves being desirous that his armyshould be transported, and their country freed, aaspeedily as might be, from the burden of such a mul­titude of men. A vast number of vessels thereforewere brought together, and of boats rudely constructedfor the purpose of short passages. Others were formedby hollowing single trees, the Gauls first showing theway; and afterwards the soldiers themselves, encou­raged by the plenty of timber, and likewise by theeasiness of the work, hastily formed clumsy hulks totransport themselves and their effects, regardless ofevery other circumstance, provided they would butfloat, and contain a burden.
27. And now, when all preparatory measures for ef­fecting their passage were completed, the enemy, onthe farther side, threatened them with a violent oppo-
. sition, covering the whole bank with horse and foot.But in order to remove these out of his way, Hanni­bal ordered Hanno, son of Bomilcar, to set out bynight, at the first watch, with a body of forces com­posed mostly of Spaniards, to march up the river tothe distance of one day's journey, and then crossing it,as secretly as possible, to lead round his detachmentwith all expedition, that he might fall on the rear ofthe enemy when so required. The Gauls, who weregiven him as guides on the occasion, informed himthat, at the distance of about twenty-five miles abovethat place, the river, spreading round a small island,showed the passage, where it divided itself, broader,and the channel consequently shallower.

As the channel would not admitthe heavy ships, the troops, removing into the lightervessels, arrived at a part of the country occupied bythree maritime cantons of the Patavians, settled onthat coast. Here they made a descent, leaving a smallguard with the ships, made themselves masters of thesecantons, set fire to the houses, drove oft' a considerablebooty of men and cattle, and allured by the sweets ofplunder, proceeded still farther from the shore. Whennews of this was brought to Patavium, where the con­tiguity of the Gauls kept the inhabitants constantly inarms, they divided their young men into two bands,one of which was led towards the quarter where themarauders were said to be busy; the other by a dif­ferent route, to avoid meeting any of the pirates, to­wards the station of the ships, fifteen miles distantfrom the town. These attacked the small craft, andkilling the guards, compelled the affrighted marinersto remove their ships to the other bank of the river.By land also, the attack on the dispersed plundererswas equally successful; and the Grecians, flying backtowards their ships, were opposed in their way by theVenetians. Thus inclosed on both sides, they werecut to pieces ; and some who were made prisonersgave information that the fleet, with their king Cleo-nymus, was but three miles distant.

peared neither the author nor cause of the alarm couldbe discovered. This year, in pursuance to the adviceof Flavius, a tribune of the commons, the Tusculanswere brought to a trial before the people. He pro­posed that punishment should be inflicted on those ofthe Tusculans ' by whose advice and assistance theVeliternians and Privernians bad made war on theRoman people.' The Tusculans, with their wives andchildren, came to Rome ; and in mourning habits, likepersons under accusation, went round the tribes, throw­ing themselves at the feet of the citizens with humblesupplications. This excited a degree of compassion,which operated more effectually towards procuringthem pardon than all the arguments they could urgedid towards clearing themselves of guilt. Every oneof the tribes, except the Pollian, negatived the propo­sition. The sentence of the Pollian tribe was, that the.grown-up males should be beaten, and put to death,and their wives and children sold by auction, accord­ing to the rules of war. It appears that the resent­ment which arose against the advisers of so rigorous ameasure was retained in memory by the Tusculansdown to the age of our fathers ; and that hardly anycandidate of the Pollian tribe could, ever since, gainthe votes of the Papirian.

Although in a hostile country, their camp waspitched in as careless a manner as if the foe were at agreat distance ; when suddenly the legions of the Sam­nites approached with so much boldness as to advancetheir rampart close to an outpost of the Romans.

tions, and intriguing at Etruria, the operations of theRomans in their own territories distressed them se­verely : for Publius Decius, when informed by hisscouts of the departure of the Samnite army, called acouncil, and there said, ' Why do we ramble throughthe country, carrying the war from one village to ano­ther?. Why not attack the cities and fortified places?No army now guards Samnium. They have fled: theyare gone into voluntary exile.' The proposal beinguniversally approved, he marched to attack Murgantia,a city of considerable strength ; and so great was theardor of the soldiers, resulting from their affection totheir commander, and from their hopes of richer trea­sure than could be found in pillaging the countryplaces, that in one day they took it by assault. Here,two thousand one hundred of the Samnites makingresistance, were surrounded and taken prisoners; andabundance of other spoil fell into the hands of the vic­tors. Decius, not choosing that the troops should beincumbered in their march with such heavy baggage,ordered them to be called together, and said to them,' Do you intend to rest satisfied with this single vic­tory, and this booty? or do you choose to cherishhopes proportioned to your bravery 1 All the cities ofthe Samnites and the property left in them are yourown ; since, after so often defeating their legions, youhave finally driven them out of the country.

Let usgo hence to the city of Itomulea, where no great labor,but greater gain awaits you.' They accordingly soldoff the spoil; and warmly adopting the general's plan,proceeded to Romulea. This town likewise was takenwithout works or engines, and plundered ; for as soonas the battalions approached it, nothing could hinderthe soldiers from mounting the walls ; but .hastily ap­plying ladders, they forced their way over the fortifi­cations.

haste, and ordered them to march at a slower rate.On the other side, the Etrurians, putting themselvesin motion on the first beginning of the fray, had comeup with their whole force ; and several expresses cameto the dictator, one after another, that all the legionsof the Etrurians had joined in the fight, and that hismen could not any longer withstand them: at the sametime he himself saw from the higher ground the peril­ous situation of the party. Confident, however, thatthe lieutenant-general was able, even yet, to supportthe dispute, and considering that he himself was athand to rescue him from defeat, he wished to let theenemy be fatigued as much as might be, in order thatwhen in that state he might fall on them with his freshtroops. Slowly as these marched, the distance wasnow just sufficient for the cavalry to begin their careerfor a charge. The battalions of the legions marchedin front, lest the enemy might suspect any secret orsudden movement, but intervals had been left in theranks of the infantry, affording room for the horsesto gallop through. At the same instant the lineraised the shout, and the cavalry, charging at fullspeed, poured on the enemy, and spread at once a ge­neral panic. After this, as succor had arrived, almosttoo late, to the 1party surrounded, so now they wereallowed intire rest, the fresh troops taking on them­selves the whole business of the fight. Nor was thateither long or dubious. The enemy were routed, andfled to their camp, which the Romans advancing toattack, they crowded altogether in the remotest partof it. Their flight being obstructed by the narrownessof the gates, the greater number climbed up on themounds and ramparts, to try if they could either de­fend themselves with the aid of the advantageousground, or get over by any means and escape. Onepart of the rampart, happening to be badly compacted,sunk under the weight of the multitude who stood onit, and fell into the trench.

But the difficulties of the ground, which had been theirinducement to make choice of it, now entangled themin the snares of their own contrivance ; very few foundmeans to escape; twenty thousand men were slain, andthe victorious Romans hastened in several parties tosecure the booty of cattle, which the enemy had so un­wisely thrown in their way.
32. While such was the situation of affairs in Sam-nium, all the states of Etruria, except the Arretians,had taken arms, and vigorously commenced hostilitiesby laying siege to Sutrium ; which city being in al­liance with the Romans, served as a barrier againstEtruria. Thither the other consul, jEmilius, camewith an army to deliver the allies from the siege. TheRomans, on their arrival, were plentifully supplied bythe Sutrians with provisions carried into their camp,which was pitched before the city. The Etruriansspent the first day in deliberating whether they shouldexpedite or protract the war. On the day following,their leaders, having determined on the speedier planin preference to the safer, as soon as the sun rose, dis­played the signal for battle, and the troops marchedout to the field : which being reported to the consul,he instantly commanded notice to be given that theyshould take refreshment, and then appear under arms.The order was obeyed; and the consul, seeing themarmed and in readiness, ordered the standards to becarried forth beyond the rampart, and drew up his menat a small distance from the enemy. Both partiesstood a long time with fixed attention, each waiting forthe shout and fight to begin on the opposite side ; andthe sun had passed the meridian before a weapon wasthrown by either. At length, rather than leave theplace without something being done, the shout wasgiven by the Etrurians, the trumpets sounded, and thebattalions advanced. Nor were the Romans less alert:both rushed to the fight with violent animosity, theEtrurians superior in numbers, the Romans in valor.The battle continued a long time doubtful, and greatnumbers fell on both sides, particularly the men of

An order wasmade that the treaty should be renewed with the Lau-rentians, and from that time this has been annuallydone on the tenth day after the Latine festival. Theprivileges of citizens were granted to the Campanianhorsemen ; and as a monument thereof they hung up atablet in the temple of Castor at Rome. The peopleof Campania were also enjoined to pay them a yearlystipend of four hundred and fifty denarii1 each ; theirnumber amounted to one thousand six hundred.
12. The war being thus brought to a conclusion,Titus Manlius, after distributing rewards and punish­ments, according to the merits and demerits of each,returned to Rome. On his arrival there, it appearedthat none but the aged came out to meet him, and thatthe young, both then and during the whole of his life,detested and cursed him. The Antians, having madeinroads on the territories of Ostia, Ardea, and Solonia,the consul Manlius, unable on account of the ill stateof his health to act against them in person, nominateddictator Lucius Papirius Crassus, who happened at thetime to be pretor, and he constituted Lucius PapiriusCursor master of the horse. Nothing worth mentionwas performed against the Antians by the dictator, al­though he kept his army in a fixed camp in the terri­tory of Antium during several months. To this year,which was signalised by conquest over so many andsuch powerful nations, and besides, by the gloriousdeath of one of the consuls, and the other's unrelent­ing severity in command, by which he has been ren­dered for ever memorable, succeeded, as consuls, Ti­berius jEmilius Mamerrinus and Quintus PubliliusPhilo, [A.U.C. 416.

their files, shut up, as it were, every opening, and inone compact body fell on the enemy; after whichthere was no other resource left. This was the mostformidable circumstance to the enemy, when, afterhaving pursued them as vanquished, they saw a newline of battle suddenly starting up with an increase ofstrength. The number of legions generally raisedwas four, each consisting of four thousand foot andthree hundred horse. To these an addition of an equalnumber used to be made by levies among the Latinos,with whom the Romans were now to contend as ene­mies, and who practised the same method in drawingup their troops: so that it was well known, that un­less the ranks should be put out of their order, theywould have to engage, not only ensign against ensign,a body of every description against one exactly similar,but even centurion against centurion. There wereamong the veterans two first centurions, one in eacharmy; the Roman deficient in bodily strength, but aman of courage and experience in service : the Latineexceedingly strong, and a first-rate warrior. Thesewere perfectly well known to each other, because theyhad always commanded centuries in equal rank. TheRoman, diffident of his strength, had, before he leftRome, obtained permission from the consuls to appointany one he thought proper his sub-centurion, to de­fend him against the one who was destined to be hisantagonist; and the youth whom he chose being op­posed to the Latine centurion in battle, obtained a vic­tory over him. The armies came to an engagement ata little distance from the foot of Mount Vesuvius,where the road led to the Veseris.
9. The Roman consuls, before they led out theirforces to the field, performed sacrifices. We are toldthat the aruspex showed to Decius that the head ofthe liver was wounde'd on the side which respectedhimself, in other respects the victim was acceptable tothe gods: but Manlius found, jn his immolation,omens highly favorable.

Thus asurrender was made in the midst of action, by the firstpromoters of the war; and on the next and followingdays the other states of this people also surrendered.The Ocriculans were admitted to a treaty of friendshipon giving security.
42. Fabius, after reaping laurels in a war allotted toanother, led back his army into his own province.And as, in the preceding year, the people had, in con­sideration of his services so successfully performed,re-elected him to the consulship, so now the senate,from the same motive, notwithstanding a warm oppo­sition made by Appius, prolonged his command forthe year following, [A. U. C. 446. B. C. 306] in whichAppius Claudius and Lucius Volumuius were consuls.In some annals I find that Appius, still holding theoffice of censor, declared himself a candidate for theconsulship, and that his election was stopped by a pro­test of Lucius Furius, plebeian tribune, until he re­signed the censorship. After his election to the con­sulship, the new war with the Sallentines, who hadtaken arms, being decreed to his colleague, he re­mained, at Rome, with design to increase his interestby popular intrigues, since the means of procuring ho­nor in war were placed in the hands of others. Vo-lumnius bad no reason to be dissatisfied with his pro­vince : he fought many battles with good success, andtook several cities by assault.

without a decision. The other Roman camp was twentymiles distant, and Papirius constantly consulted hisabsent colleague, on every thing which he undertook,while Carvilius, on his part, directed a greater shareof his attention to Aquilonia, where the state of affairswas more critical and important than to Cominium,which he himself was besieging. When Papirius hadfully adjusted every measure, preparatory to an en­gagement, he despatched a message to his colleague,that ' he intended, if the auspices permitted, to fightthe enemy on the day following; and that it would benecessary that he, Carvilius, should at the same timemake an assault on Cominium, with his utmost force,that the Samnites there might have no leisure to sendany succor to Aquilonia.' The messenger had the dayfor the performance of his journey, and he returned inthe night, with an answer to the consul, that his col­league approved of the plan. Papirius, on sending offthe messenger, had instantly called an assembly, wherehe descanted at large on the nature of the war in gene­ral, and on the mode at present adopted by the enemy,in the equipment of their troops, which certainly servedfor empty parade, but could have no kind of efficacytowards ensuring success ; for ' plumes,' he said, ' madeno wounds ; that a Roman javelin would make its waythrough shields, however painted and gilt; and that thedazzling whiteness of their tunics, would soon be be­smeared with blood, when the sword began its work.His father had formerly cut off to a man a gold and silverarmy of the Samnites; and such accoutrements hadmade a more respectable figure, as spoils, in the handsof the conquering foe, than as arms in those of the wear­ers. Perhaps it was allotted by destiny to his name andfamily that they should be opposed in command againstthe most powerful efforts of the Samnites ; and shouldbring home spoils, of such beauty, as to serve forornaments to the public places.

having been made consul under propitious auspices,though gods and men united in recalling him whenready to give battle, he had refused obedience; andnow, conscious of having treated them with disrespect,had fled to avoid the capitol, and the customary offer­ing of vows; unwilling, on the day of his entering intooffice, to approach the temple of Jupiter supremelygood and great; to see and consult the senate, to whomhe knew that he was odious ; and that he was the onlyperson by whom they were hated; that he had failedto proclaim the Latine festival, and to perform on theAlban Mount the customary sacrifices to Jupiter La-tiaris, to go up to the capitol, under the direction ofauspices, in order to offer vows, and thence to proceedto his province in the habit of a commander, and at­tended by lictors. Instead of which, he had gone off,without badges of authority, without lictors, like asoldier's servant, privately and by stealth ; just as ifhe were quitting his country to go into exile; sup­posing, no doubt, that he might assume his office in amanner more suitable to the dignity of supreme ma­gistrate at Ariminum, than at Rome, and put on theconsular robe in a public inn better than in his owndwelling.' They resolved unanimously that he shouldbe recalled ; that his return should be insisted on, andthat he should be compelled to perform in person allduties both to gods and men before he went to hisprovince. On this embassy (for it was resolved thatambassadors should be sent) went Quintus Terentiusand Marcus Antistius, whose arguments had no moreweight with him than had the letter sent to him bythe senate in his former consulate. In a few daysafter he entered on his office, and as he was offering asacrifice on the occasion, a calf, after receiving astroke, made its escape out of the hands of thosewho officiated at the sacrifice, and sprinkled many ofthe by-standers with its blood.

ready described, they marched forth to battle. Man-lius commanded the right wing ; Decius the left. Atthe beginning the conflict was maintained with equalstrength on both sides, and with equal courage. After­wards, the Roman spearmen on the left wing, unable towithstand the violent push made by the Latines, re­treated to the principes. On this disorder happening,the consul Decius called to Marcus Valerius, with aloud voice, ' Valerius, we want the aid of the gods:as public pontiff of the Roman people, dictate to methe words in which I may devote myself for the le­gions.' The pontiff then directed him to take thegown called pretexta, and with his head covered andhis hand thrust up under the gown to his chin, stand­ing on a spear laid under, his feet to repeat thesewords: ' O Janus, Jupiter, Father Mars, Quirinus,Bellona, you Lares, you gods Novensiles,1 you godsIndigetes, you divinities, under whose dominion weand our enemies are, and you gods of the infernal re­gions, I beseech you, I adore you, I implore of you,that you may propitiously grant strength and victoryto the Roman* people, the Quirites, and affect theenemies of the Roman people, the Quirites, withterror, dismay, and death. In such manner as I haveexpressed in words, so do I devote the legions, and theauxiliaries of our foes, together with myself, to theinfernal gods, and to earth, for the republic of the Ro­mans, for the army, legions, and auxiliaries of theRoman people, the Quirites.' After he had utteredthese solemn words, he ordered his lictors to go toTitus Manlius, and to inform his colleague withoutdelay that he had devoted himself for the army. Thengirding himself in the Gabine cincture, and taking hisarms, he leaped on his horse, and plunged into themidst of the enemy.

ment for being deprived of their lands, were defeatedand driven out of their camp in the plains of Ferenti-num ; and while Publilius, under whose conduct andauspices the battle had been fought, was employedthere in receiving the submissions of the Latine states,who had lost the greater part of their young men inthe engagement, jEmilius led the army towards Pe­dum. The people of this city were supported by theTiburtine, Praenestine, and Veliternian states : auxili­aries also came to them from Lavinium and Antium.Though the Romans had here the superiority in seve­ral engagements, yet the most difficult part of the bu­siness remained still to be attempted at the city of Pe­dum itself, and at the camp of the combined states,which lay close to the walls; when the consul, onhearing that a triumph had been decreed to his col­league, hastily left the war unfinished, and repaired toRome to demand a triumph for himself before he hadobtained a victory. The senate, offended at his ambi­tious proceeding, refused to grant it until Pedumshould either surrender or be taken. This so alienated^Emilius from their interests, that he acted during theremainder of his consulate like a seditious tribune;for as long as he continued in office he never ceasedcriminating the patricians in harangues to the people,which his colleague, who was himself a plebeian, tookno pains to prevent. The charges he brought againstthem were grounded on a scanty distribution of theLatine and Falernian lands: and when the senate,wishing to put an end to the administration of the con­suls, ordered a dictator to be nominated to conduct thewar against the Latines, who were again in arms,jEmilius, who was the acting consul at the time, nomi­nated his colleague dictator, who appointed Junius Bru­tus master of the horse. The dictatorship of Publiliuswas popular, for his discourses were replete with invec­tives against the patricians. He at the same time passedthree laws, highly advantageous to the commons, andinjurious to the nobility : one, that the orders of thecommons should bind all the Romans; another, that

they not only prevented the Romans from marchingforward jnto their country, but even from procuringforage from their lands ; and the foragers were obligedto go back into the quiet country of Sora. News ofthese events being conveyed to Rome, with circum­stances of alarm magnified beyond the truth, LuciusPostumius, the consul, though scarcely recovered fromhis illness, was obliged to set out for the army. How­ever, before his departure, having issued a proclama­tion that his troops should assemble at Sora, he dedi­cated the temple of Victory, for the building of whichhe had provided, when curule edile, out of the moneyarising from fines; and, joining the army, he advancedfrom Sora towards Samnium, to the camp of his col­league. The Samnites, despairing of being able tomake head against the two armies, retreated fromthence, on which the consuls, separating, proceededby different routes to lay waste the enemy's lands, andbesiege their towns.
34. Postumius attempted to make himself master ofMilionia by storm ; but not succeeding with regularworks, he carried his approaches to the walls, andthus gained an entrance into the place. The fight wascontinued in all parts of the city from the fourth houruntil near the eighth, and for a great part of the timewithout any decisive advantage: the Romans at lastgained possession of it. Three thousand two hundredof the Samnites were killed, four thousand two hun­dred taken, besides the other booty. From thencethe legions were conducted to Ferentinum, out ofwhich the inhabitants had, during the night, retired insilence through the opposite gate, with all their effectswhich could be either carried or driven. The consul,on his arrival, approached the walls with the same or­der and circumspection as if he were to meet an oppo­sition here equal to what he had experienced at Mili­onia.

C.331.] The dictator presiding at the election, TitusVeturius and Spurius Postumius were created consuls.Notwithstanding the war with the Sidicinians remainedunfinished, yet being desirous to prevent, by an act ofgenerosity, the wishes of the commons, they proposedto the senate the sending a colony to Cales; and a de­cree being passed that two thousand five hundred menshould be inrolled for that purpose, they constitutedCaeso Duillius, Titus Quintius, and Marcus Fabius,commissioners for conducting the colony, and distri­buting the lands.
17. The new consuls, receiving from their predeces­sors the command of the army, marched into the ene­my's country, and carried devastation even to the wallsof their capital. There, because it was expected thatthe Sidicinians, who had collected a vast body of forces,would make a vigorous struggle in support of their lasthope, and a report also prevailing that Samnium waspreparing for hostilities, the consuls, by direction ofthe senate, nominated dictator Publius Cornelius Ru-finus, who appointed Marcus Antonius his master ofthe horse. A doubt afterwards arose with respect tothe regularity of their creation, on which they abdi­cated their offices; and a pestilence ensuing, recoursewas had to an interregnum, as if the auspices of everyoffice had been infected by that irregularity.

people, moved by compassion for his early age, andindignation at his barbarous treatment, reflecting atthe same time what might be the lot of themselves,and of their children, flocked together into the forum,and from thence in a body to the senate-house. Whenthe consuls were obliged by the sudden tumult torail a meeting of the senate, the people falling at thefeet of each of the senators as they were going into thesenate-house, presented to their view the back of Caiustorn with stripes. On that day, in consequence of theoutrageous conduct of an individual, one of the strong­est bonds of credit was broken ; and the consuls werecommanded to propose to the people that no personshould be held in fetters or stocks, except convictedof a crime, and in order to punishment; but that formoney due the goods of the debtor, not his person,should be answerable. Thus the confined debtorswere released; and provision made for the time tocome that they should not be liable to confinement.
29. In the course of this year, while the war with theSamnites was sufficient in itself to give full employ­ment to the senate, besides the sudden defection of theLucanians, and the intrigues of the Tarentines, bywhich it had been effected, they found another sourceof uneasiness in a union formed by the state of theVestinians with the Samnites. Which event, thoughit continued during the present year to be the generalsubject of conversation, without coming under anypublic discussion, appeared so important to the con­suls of the year following, [A.

relieving Saticula, sat themselves down before Plistia,which was in alliance with the Romans, that they mightif possible retort equal vexation on their enemy.
22. The year coming to a conclusion, the war wasthenceforward conducted by a dictator, Quintus Fa-bius. [A.U. C. 439. B.C. 313.] The new consuls,Lucius Papirius Cursor and Quiutus Publilius Philo,both a fourth time, as the former had done, remainedat Rome. Fabius came with a reinforcement to Sati­cula, to receive the command of the army from jEmi-lius. The Samnites had not continued before Plistia ;but having sent for a new supply of men from home,and relying on their numbers, had encamped in thesame spot as before; and, by provoking the Romans 'to battle, endeavored to divert them from the siege.The dictator, so much the more intently, pushed for­ward his operations against the fortifications of theenemy; considering the taking of the city as the onlyobject of the war, and showing an indifference withrespect to the Samnites, except that he placed guardsin proper places to prevent any attempt on his camp.This encouraged the Samnites, so that they rode up tothe rampart, and allowed him no quiet. These nowcoming up close to the gates of the camp, QuintusAulius Cerretanus, master of the horse, without con­sulting the dictator, sallied out furiously at the headof all the troops of cavalry, and drove them back. Inthis desultory kind of fight Fortune exerted her powerin such a manner as to occasion an extraordinary losson both sides, and the remarkable deaths of the com­manders themselves. First, the general of the Sam­nites, filled with indignation at being repulsed, andcompelled to fly from a place to which he had advancedwith such confidence, prevailed on his horsemen, byintreaties and exhortations, to renew the battle. Ashe was easily distinguished among the horsemen, whilehe urged on the fight, the Roman master of the horsegalloped up against him in such a furious career that,with one stroke of his spear, he tumbled him lifelessfrom his horse.

Orders beingthen issued for all to assemble at Aquilonia, the wholestrength of Samnium came together, amounting to fortythousand men. There a piece of ground, in the middleof the camp, was inclosed with hurdles and boards, andcovered overhead with linen cloth, the sides being allof an equal length, about two hundred feet. In thisplace sacrifices were performed, according to directionsread out of an old linen book, the function of priestbeing discharged by a very old man, called Ovius Pac-cius, w ho affirmed that he took these ceremonials fromthe ancient ritual of the Samnites, being the same whichtheir ancestors used when they had formed the secretdesign of wresting Capua from the Etrurians. Whenthe sacrifices were finished, the general ordered a beadleto summons every one of those who were most highlydistinguished by their birth, or conduct: these wereintroduced singly. Besides the other exhibitions ofthe solemnity, calculated to impress the mind withreligious awe, there were, in the middle of the coveredenclosure, altars erected, about which lay the victimsslain, and the centurions stood around with their swordsdrawn. The soldier was led up to the altars, ratherlike a victim, than a performer in the ceremony, andwas bound by an oath not to divulge what he shouldsee and hear in that place. He was then compelled toswear, in a dreadful kind of form, containing execra­tions on his own person, on his family and race, if hedid not go to battle, whithersoever the commandersshould lead; and, if either he himself fled from thefield, or, in case he should see any other flying, didnot immediately kill him.

29. Thenceforward the battle seemed to be foughtwith a degree of force which could scarcely be deemedhuman. The Romans, on the loss of their general, acircumstance which on other occasions is wont to in­spire terror, stopped their flight, and reassumed spiritto begin the combat afresh. The Gauls, and espe­cially those who encircled the consul's body, as if de­prived of reason, cast their javelins at random withoutexecution ; some became so stupid as not to think ofeither fighting or flying : while on the other side, Li-vius the pontiff, to whom Decius had transferred hislictors, with ord'ers to act as propretor, cried out aloudthat ' the Romans were victorious, being exemptedfrom misfortune by the death of their consul. Thatthe Gauls and Sanmites were now the victims of Mo­ther Earth, and the infernal gods. That Decius wassummoning and dragging to himself the army devotedalong with him ; and that among the enemy all wasfull of dismay, and the vengeance of all the furies.'While the soldiers were busy in restoring the fight,they were joined by Lucius Cornelius Scipio and CaiusMarcius, with some reserved troops from the rear,who had been sent by Quintus Fabius, the consul, tothe support of his colleague. These, on being madeacquainted with the fate of Decius, were powerfullyexcited to brave every danger in the cause of the pub­lic ; but as the Gauls stood in close order, with theirshields formed into a fence before them, little prospectof success appeared from a close fight. The javelinswhich lay scattered between the two lines were, there­fore, by order of the lieutenants-general, gathered upfrom the ground, and thrown against the enemy'sshields ; and as most of them pierced the fence, thelong-pointed ones even into their bodies, their com­pact band was overthrown in such a manner, that a

diligence than would have been deemed requisite inthe case of war with any neighboring state, intelligencewas brought, by scouts despatched for the purpose,that all was quiet among the Gauls. Suspicions werealso entertained that Samnium still continued, duringthis year, in a disposition to raise new disturbances;for which reason the Roman troops were not withdrawnfrom the country of the Sidicinians. An attack madeby Alexander, king of Epirus, on the Lucanians, drewthe Samnites to that quarter, where those two nations,fought a pitched battle with the king as he was makinga descent on the side of the country adjoining Paestum.Alexander, having gained the victory, concluded atreaty of amity with the Romans ; with what degree offaith he would have observed it, had the rest of hisenterprises proved successful, it is hard to say. Thecensus, or general survey, was performed this year,and the new citizens rated; on whose account two ad­ditional tribes were constituted, the Maician and Scap-tian, by the censors, Quintus Publilius Philo andSpurius Postumius. The Acerrans were inrolled asRomans, in pursuance of a law introduced by the pre-tor, Lucius Papirius, which granted them the privi­leges of citizens, excepting the right of suffrage. Suchwere the transactions, foreign and domestic, of thisyear.
18. The following year [A. U. C. 423. B.C. 329]exhibited a shocking scene, whether occasioned by theintemperature of the air or by the wickedness of thepeople. The consuls were Marcus Claudius Marcel-lus, and Caius Valerius, either Flaccus or Potitus, forI find these different surnames of the consul in the an­nals ; it is however a matter of little consequencewhich of them be the true one. There is another ac­count, which I could heartily wish were false ; thatthose persons whose deaths distinguished this year asdisastrous on account of the extraordinary mortalitywere cut off by poison.

On which, asking whatwas the nature of this great commotion, or what itportended, he was told that it meant the devastation ofItaly: he was then ordered to proceed in his course,and not to inquire farther, but let the decrees of thedestinies remain in obscurity.
23. Overjoyed at this vision, he led his forces inthree divisions over the lberus, having sent forwardemissaries to conciliate by presents the friendship ofthe Gauls, through whose country the army was topass, and to explore the passes of the Alps. Thenumber of forces which he brought across the lberuswas ninety thousand foot, and twelve thousand horse.He then reduced the Ilergetans, the Bargusians, theAusetanians, and the province of Lacetania, which layat the foot of the Pyrenean mountains. The govern­ment of all this tract he gave to Hanno, with inten­tion to retain the command of the narrow passes whichlead from Spain into Gaul; and, to enable him tosecure the possession of it, assigned him a body offorces, consisting of ten thousand foot and one thou­sand horse. When the army began to pass the defilesof the Pyrenees, and a rumor spread with greatercertainty among the barbarians that the war was in­tended against the Romans, three thousand of the Car-petan foot left him, and marched away, actuated, asclearly appeared, not so much by dread of the enemy,as of the great length of the march, and the insu­perable difficulty of crossing the Alps. Hannibal,considering that to recall or detain them by forcemight be attended with dangerous consequences, andwishing to avoid every thing that might irritate theferocious tempers of the rest, sent home above tenthousand men, in whom he had discovered an equalaversion from the service, pretending that he had inlike manner dismissed the Carpetans.

The other consul, JEmi-lius, on marching into the Sabellan territory, foundneither a camp of the Samnites, nor legions to opposehim ; but, while he was wasting their country with fireand sword, ambassadors came to him, suing for peace.He referred them to the senate; where, when theywere admitted to an audience, laying aside their fierce­ness of spirit, they requested of the Romans that peacemight be restored between the two nations, and that theymight be at liberty to carry on war against the Sidi-cinians : these requests^ they alleged, they were thebetter intitled to make, as ' they had united in friend­ship with the Roman people, at a time when their ownaffairs were in a florishing state, not in a season of dis­tress, as the Campanians had done ; and because thoseagainst whom they wished to take arms were the Sidi-ciuians, who had ever been enemies to them, and neverfriends to the Romans; who had neither, as the Sam-,nites, sought their friendship in time of peace, nor, asthe Campanians, their assistance in war; nor wereconnected with them in any way, either of alliance orsubjection.'
2. The pretor Tiberius /Emilius having required theopinion of the senate respecting the demands of theSamuites, and the senate having voted a renewal of thetreaty with them, gave them this answer, that ' as theRomans had given no cause to hinder the uninterruptedcontinuance of their friendship, so neither did they nowobject to its being revived; since the Samnites showedan unwillingness to persevere in a war which theyhad brought on themselves through their own fault.That, as to what regarded the Sidicinians, they did notinterfere with the liberty of the Samnite nation to de­termine for themselves with respect to peace and war.'The treaty being concluded, and the ambassadors re-

To the Roman people, towhom you owe your life, you can perform no greaterservice than to let this day teach you the importantlesson of submission to lawful commands, both in warand peace.' He then declared that the master of thehorse was at liberty to depart; and, as he retired fromthe rostrum, the senate, being greatly rejoiced, andthe people still more so, gathered round him, andescorted him, on one hand commending the dictator,on the other congratulating the master of the horse;while all agreed in opinion that the authority of mili­tary command was confirmed no less effectually in theinstance of Quintus Fabius than in that of young Man-lius. It so happened that, through the course of thatyear, as often as the dictator left the army, the Sarn-nites were in motion: but Marcus Valerius, the lieu­tenant-general, who commanded in the camp, hadQuintus Fabius before his eyes for an example, not tofear any violence of the enemy, so much as the unre­lenting anger of the dictator: so that when a body ofhis foragers fell into an ambuscade, and were cut topieces in disadvantageous ground, it was generallybelieved that the lieutenant-general could have giventhem assistance, if he had not been held in dread byhis rigorous orders. The resentment which this ex­cited helped to alienate the affections of the soldieryfrom the dictator ; against whom they had been beforeincensed by his implacable behavior towards QuintusFabius, and from having granted him pardon at theintercession of the Roman people, after he had refusedit to their intreaties.

The dictator prohibited Quintus Fabius fromacting in any case as a magistrate, conferred the com­mand in the city on Lucius Papirius Crassus, as masterof the horse, and then returned to the camp; wherehis arrival brought neither any great joy to his coun­trymen nor any degree of terror to the enemy ; for, onthe day following, either not knowing the dictator's

6. First, the consuls, nearly half naked, were sentunder the yoke ; then each officer, according to hisrank, was exposed to disgrace, and the same of the le­gions successively. The enemy stood on each sideunder arms, reviling and mocking them ; swords werepointed at most of them ; several were wounded, andsome even slain, when their looks, rendered too fierceby the indignity to which they were subjected, gaveoffence to the conquerors. Thus were they led underthe yoke; and, what was still more intolerable, underthe eyes of the enemy., When they had got clear ofthe defile they seemed as if they had been drawn upfrom the infernal regions, and then for the first timebeheld the light; yet, wheu they viewed the ignomini­ous appearance to which the army was reduced, thelight itself was more painful to them than any kind ofdeath could have been ; so that although they mighthave arrived at Capua before night, yet, doubting thefidelity of the allies, and embarrassed by shame, theyhalted at a small distance from that city. They stoodin need of every kind of refreshment, yet threw them­selves carelessly on the ground, on each side of theroad; which being told at Capua, compassion for thesituation of their allies took place of the arrogance na­tural to the Campanians. They immediately sent tothe consuls their ensigns of office, the fasces and lie-tors ; to the soldiers, arms, horses, clothes, and provi­sions in abundance ; and, on their approach, the wholesenate and people went out to meet them, and per­formed every proper office of hospitality, both publicand private.

law to be passed concerning appeals; more carefullyenforcing the observance of it by additional sanctions.This was the third time since the expulsion of the kingsof this law being introduced, and always by the samefamily. The reason for renewing it so often was, Ibelieve, no other than that the influence of a few wasapt to prove too powerful for the liberty of the com­mons. However, the Porcian law seems intendedsolely for the security of the persons of the citizens; asevere penalty being thereby enacted against beatingwith stripes, or putting to death, a Roman citizen.The Valerian law, after forbidding a person who hadappealed to be beaten with rods and beheaded, added,in case of any one acting contrary thereto, that it shallyet be only deemed a wicked act. -This, I suppose,was judged of sufficient strength to enforce obedienceto the law in those days; so powerful was then men'ssense of shame: at present one would scarcely makeuse of such a threat seriously, even on any ordinaryoccasion. The jEquans rebelling, the same consulconducted the war against them; in which no memo­rable event occurred; for, except ferocity, they re­tained nothing of their ancient condition. The otherconsul, Appuleius, invested the town of Nequinum inUmbria. The ground, the same whereon Narnia nowstands, was so steep, (on one side even perpendicular,')as to render the town impregnable, either by assaultor works. [A. U. C. 453. B.C. 299.] That businesstherefore came unfinished into the hands of the suc­ceeding consuls, Marcus Fulvius Pretinus and TitusManlius Torquatus. We are told by Licinius Macerand Tubero that all the centuries named Quintus Fa-bius, though not a candidate, consul for that year ; butthat he himself recommended to them to postpone theconferring the consulship on him until a year whereinthere might be more employment for their arms ; add-iug, that during the present year he might be moreuseful in the management of a city magistracy; andthus, neither dissembling what he aimed at, nor yetmaking direct application for it, he was appointed cu­

diers, and speak to them ; and, as he came up to each,he rebuked them for their backwardness in takingarms, asking, ' Why they loitered and declined thefight.' If they did not choose to go out of the camp,the enemy would come into it; and they must fight indefence of their tents, if they would not in defence ofthe rampart. Men who have arms in their hands, andcontend with their foe, have always a chance for vic­tory ; but the man who waits naked and unarmed forhis enemy must suffer either death or slavery.' Tothese reprimands and rebukes they answered that' they were exhausted by the fatigue of the battle ofyesterday, and had no strength nor even blood re­maining; and, besides, the enemy appeared more nu­merous than they were the day before.' The hostilearmy, in the mean time, drew near: so that, seeingevery thing more distinctly as the distance grew less,they asserted that the Samnites carried with them pal-lisades for a rampart, and evidently intended to drawlines of circumvallation round the camp. On this theconsul exclaimed with great earnestness against sub­mitting to such an ignominious insult, and from sodastardly a foe. ' Shall we even be blockaded,' saidhe, ' in our camp, and die like cowards by famine,rather than like men, if death must be our lot, by thesword? May the gods be propitious! and let everyone act in the manner which he thinks becomes him.The consul Marcus Atilius, should no other accom­pany him, will go out, even alone, to face the enemy,and will fall in the middle of the Samnite battalions,rather thau see the Roman camp inclosed by theirtrenches.' The lieutenants-general, tribunes, everytroop of the cavalry, and the principal centurions, ex­pressed their approbation of what the consul said ; andthe soldiers at length, overcome by shame, took uptheir arms, but in a spiritless manner ; and in thesame spiritless manner marched out of the camp.

lie desired them to ' seek counsel from those by whoseadvice they had received that garrison into the city.'They then departed, and returned to their countrymen,having obtained from the consul, with much difficulty,permission to consult their senate, and bring back theiranswer to him. Two factions divided the senate; theleaders of one had been the authors of the defectionfrom the Roman people ; the other consisted of the citi­zens who retained their loyalty ; both however showedan earnest desire that every means should be used to­wards effecting an accommodation with the consul forthe restoration of peace. As the Samnite garrison,being in no respect prepared for holding out a siege,intended to retire the next night out of the town, oneparty thought it sufficient to discover to the consul atwhat hour, through what gate, and by what road, hisenemy was to march out. The other, who had opposedthe going over to the Samnites, went farther, andopened one of the gates for the consul in the night,secretly admitting him into the town. In consequenceof this twofold treachery the Samnite garrison wassurprised and overpowered by an ambush, placed inthe woody places near the road; and, at the same time,a shout was raised in the city, which was now filledwith the besiegers. Thus, in the short space of onehour, the Samnites were put to the sword, the Satricansmade prisoners, and all things reduced under the powerof the consul; who, taking proper measures to discoverwho were the'instigators of the revolt, scourged withrods and beheaded such as he found to be guilty ; andthen, disarming the Satricans, he placed a strong gar­rison in the place. On this, Papirius Cursor proceededto Borne to celebrate his triumph, according to the re­lation of those authors, who say that he was the gene­ral who retook Luceria, and sent the Samnites underthe yoke. Undoubtedly, as a warrior, he was deserv­ing of every praise, excelling not only in vigor of mind,but likewise in strength of body.

Now you are ten in number; and, what is more,Romans, and the bravest among the Romans. Thenight is in your favor; which, by concealing the realstate of things, magnifies every object to people whenonce alarmed. I will immediately fill every place withterror: be you alert in defending the citadel.' Hethen ran down in haste, crying aloud, ' To arms, citi­zens ; we are undone ; the citadel is taken by the ene­my ; run, defend it.' This he repeated as he passedthe doors of the principal men ; the same to all whomhe met; and also to those who ran out in a fright intothe streets. The alarm, communicated first by one,was soon spread by numbers through all the city.The magistrates, dismayed on hearing from scouts thatthe citadel was full of arms and armed men, whosenumber they multiplied, laid aside all hopes of reco­vering it. Flight began on every side ; and the towns­men, half asleep, and for the most part unarmed, brokeopen the gates, through one of which the body of Ro­man troops, roused by the noise, burst in, and slewthe terrified inhabitants who attempted to skirmish inthe streets.

' He wouldgive them land,' he told them, ' in Italy, Africa, orSpain, wherever they should choose, exempt from allcharges, to the person who should receive it, and tohis children. Should any prefer money to land, hewould give him an equivalent in silver. To such of theallies as wished-to become citizens of Carthage, thatprivilege should be granted. With regard to thosewho chose rather to return to their native homes, hewould take care that they should not have cause towish for an exchange of situation with anyone of theircountrymen.' To the slaves also who attended theirmasters he promised liberty, engaging to give theowners two slaves in the room of each of these. Then,to give them full security for the performance of allthis, holding in his left hand a lamb, and in his righthand a flint stone, he prayed to Jupiter and the rest ofthe gods, that if he did not fulfil these engagements,they would slay him, in. like manner as he slew thatlamb; and, after this imprecation, he broke the ani­mal's head with the stone. This had such an effectthat all the soldiers, as if they had now received thesurety of the gods for the ratification of their hopes,and thinking that nothing delayed the enjoyment oftheir wishes, but the battle not being begun, with onemind, and one voice, demanded the fight.

After expiatingthese prodigies, Scipio at the head of his cavalry andlight spearmen, set out towards the camp of the enemy,in order to discover, by a near view of their forces,how great and of what kind they were; and was metby Hannibal, who had likewise advanced with his ca­

When the deputies returned him thanksfor so very meritoriously subduing bis passion, be stillpersevered in obstinate silence, and dismissed themwithout any answer, or mention of what he had done ;a proof that he felt an extraordinary degree of resent­ment, which it cost him a violent struggle to suppress.Papirius appointed Caius Junius Bubulcus master ofthe horse; and, as he was proceeding in an assemblyof the curiae,1 to get an order passed respecting thecommand of the army, an unlucky omen obliged himto adjourn it; for the curia which was to vote firsthappened to be the Faucian, remarkably distinguishedby two disasters, the taking of the city, and the Cau-dine peace ; the same curia having voted first in thoseyears in which the said events are found. LiciniusMacer supposes this curia ominous also, on account ofa third misfortune, that which was experienced at theCremera.

Next day the dictator, taking the auspices anew,obtained the order;° and, marching out at the head ofthe legions lately raised on the alarm occasioned bythe army passing the Ciminian forest, came to Lon-gula; where, having received the troops of the consulMarcius, he led on his forces to battle; nor did theenemy seem to decline the combat. However, theystood under arms until night came on, neither sidechoosing to begin the fray.

Nor is itconfidence, but necessity, which now prompts them tofight: unless you suppose that those who avoided fight­ing, when their force was intire, have acquired greaterconfidence after the loss of two-thirds of their infantryand cavalry in the passage over the Alps ; after greaternumbers have perished than survive. But it may besaid, they are few indeed, but vigorous in mind andbody, having a power and strength no force can with­stand. On the contrary, they are but the resemblance,mere shadows of men, rendered lifeless by hunger,cold, filth, and nastiness; battered and disabled amongthe rocks and precipices. Add to this, their joints be­numbed, their sinews stiffened, their limbs shrivelledby the frost, their armor shattered and broken, theirhorses lamed and enfeebled. Such is the infantry,such the cavalry, with whom you are to fight. Youwill have to deal, not with enemies, but the remains ofenemies. And nothing do I fear more than lest, beforeyou come to a battle, the Alps may appear to haveconquered Hannibal.

while the public attention was deeply engaged by twomost important wars.
31. The consuls adjusting the provinces betweenthem, the Samnites fell by lot to Junius, the new warof Etruria to /Emilias. In the country of the former,the Samnites finding themselves unable to take Cluvia,a Roman garrison, by force, had formed a blockade,and reduced it by famine to capitulate; and, aftertorturing with stripes in a shocking manner the towns­men who surrendered, had put them to death. En­raged at this cruelty, Junius determined to postponeevery thing else to the attacking of Cluvia; and, on thefirst day that he assaulted the walls, took it by storm,and slew all who were grown to man's estate. Thevictorious troops were led from thence to Bovianum ;this was the capital of the Pentrian Samnites, by farthe most opulent of their cities, and the most powerfulboth in men and arms. The soldiers, stimulated bythe hope of plunder, soon made themselves masters ofthe town: where, their resentment being less violent,there was less severity exercised on the enemy; but aquantity of spoil was carried off, greater almost thanhad ever been collected out of all Samnium, and thewhole was liberally bestowed on the assailers. TheSamnites now perceiving that the Romans possessedsuch a superiority in arms, that no force in the field,no camp, no cities, could withstand them, bent theirwhole attention to find out an opportunity of acting bystratagem. They conceived that the enemy, proceedingwith incautious eagerness in pursuit of plunder, might,on such occasion, be caught in a snare and overpowered.Some peasants who deserted, and some prisoners whowere taken, (part of them being purposely thrown in theway, while others were met by accident,) concurred intheir report to the consul, which at the same time wastrue, that a vast quantity of cattle had been driven to­gether into a certain defile of difficult access, and bywhich he was induced to lead thither the legions lightlyaccoutred, in order to seize the prey.

63. Flaminius, one of the consuls elect, to whom hadfallen by lot the legions which wintered at Placentia,sent an edict and letter to the consul, desiring thatthose troops should be ready in camp at Ariminum onthe ides of March. His design was to enter on theoffice of consul in his province ; for he rememberedhis old disputes with the patricians, the contests inwhich he had engaged with them when tribune of thecommons, and afterwards, when consul, first about theconsulship, his election to which they wanted to annul,and then about a triumph. He was besides hated bythe patricians on account of a new law, prejudicial tothe senators, introduced by Caius Claudius, a plebeiantribune, to which Caius Flaminius alone, of all the pa­tricians, had given his support, that no senator, or sonof a senator, should be owner of a ship fit for sea-voyages, which contained more than three hundredamphoras.1 This size was thought sufficient for con­veying the produce of their farms, and every kind oftraffic was deemed unbecoming a senator. This busi­ness had been contested with the utmost degree of heat,and had procured to Flaminius, the advocate for thelaw, great hatred among the nobility, but as great popu­larity among the commons, and, in consequence ofthis, a second consulship. For these reasons, sus­pecting that they would, by falsifying the auspices, bythe delay of celebrating the Latine festival, and otherimpediments to which a consul was liable, detain himin the city, he pretended a journey, and, while yet ina private capacity, went secretly into the province.This step, when it became known, added fresh resent­ment to the animosity which, before this, possessedthe breasts of the senators; they exclaimed, that' Caius Flaminius now waged war, not only with thesenate, but with the immortal gods.

Romans had by this time passed over the rampart, andfilled the camp with slaughter and confusion: theSamnite army had their disorder increased by a sud­den insurrection of their prisoners; some of whom,getting loose, set the rest at liberty, while otherssnatched the arms which were tied up among the bag­gage, and being intermixed with the troops, raised a-tumult more terrible than the battle itself. They thenperformed a memorable exploit; for, making an attackon Statins Minacius, the general, as he was passingbetween the ranks and encouraging his men, they dis­persed the horsemen who attended him, gatheredround himself, and dragged him, sitting on his horse,a prisoner to the Roman consul. This brought back,the foremost battalions of the Samnites, and the bat­tle, which seemed to have been already decided, wasrenewed : but they could not support it long. Sixthousand of them were slain, and two thousand firehundred taken, among whom were four military tri­bunes, together with thirty standards, and, what gavethe conquerors greater joy than all, seven thousandfour hundred prisoners were recovered. The spoilwhich had been taken from the allies was immense,and the owners were summoned by a proclamation toclaim and receive their property.

The depredations committed on the lands ofCampania had occasioned a violent alarm at Rome;and it happened that about the same time intelligencewas brought from Etruria that, after the departure ofVolumnius' army, all that country had risen up inarms, together with Gellius Egnatius, the leader of theSamnites; that the Umbrians were invited to join inthe insurrection, and the Gauls tempted with highoffers. Terrified at this news, the senate ordered thecourts of justice to be shut, and a levy to be made ofmen of every description. Accordingly, not only free­

the enemy were slain or taken. Some affirm that thisfamous battle was fought on the farther side of theCiminian forest, at Perusia; and that the public hadbeen tinder great dread lest the army might be inclosedin such a dangerous pass, and overpowered by a gene­ral combination of the Etrurians and Umbrians. Buton whatever spot it was fought it is certain that theRoman power prevailed ; and in consequence thereofambassadors came from Perusia, Cortona, and Arre-tium, which were then among the principal states ofEtruria, to solicit a peace and alliance with the Ro­mans ; and they obtained a truce for thirty years.
38. During these transactions in Etruria the otherconsul, Caius Marcius Rutilus, took Allifae by stormfrom the Samnites; and many of their forts and smallertowns were either destroyed by his arms or surren­dered intire. About the same time also the Romanfleet, having sailed to Campania under Publius Corne­lius, to whom the senate had given the command onthe sea coast, put into Pompeii. Immediately on land­ing the marine soldiers set out to ravage the countryabout Nuceria; and after they had quickly laid wastethe parts which lay nearest, and whence they couldhave returned to the ships with safety, they were al­lured by the temptation of plunder, as it often happens,to advance too far, and thereby roused the enemyagainst them. While they rambled about the countrythey met no opposition, though they might have beencut off to a man ; but as they were returning, in acareless manner, the peasants overtook them, not farfrom the ships, stripped them of the booty, and evenslew a great part of them. Those who escaped weredriven in confusion to the ships. As the news of Fa-bius having marched through the Ciminian forest hadoccasioned violent apprehensions at Rome, so it hadexcited joy in proportion among the enemy in Sam-mum : they talked of the Roman army being pent upand surrounded, and of the Caudine forks, as a modelof what they were to undergo.

I pray you,Appius Claudius, this being now the hundredth yearsince the dictatorship of Mamercus jEmilius, duringwhich period so many men of the highest charactersand abilities have filled that office, did none of theseever read the twelve tables ? None of them know,that whatever was the last order of the people, thatwas law? Nay, certainly they all knew it ; and theytherefore obeyed the jEmilian law rather than the oldone, under which the censors had been at first created ;because it was the last order ; and because, when twolaws are contradictory, the new always repeals theold. Do you mean to say, Appius, that the peopleare not bound by the jEmilian law? or, that the peo­ple are bound, and you alone exempted? The jEmilianlaw bound those violent censors, Caius Furius andMarcus Geganius, who showed what mischief thatoffice might do in the state ; when, out of resentmentfor the limitation of their power, they disfranchisedMamercus jEmilins, the first man of the age, either inwar or peace. It bound all the censors thenceforward,during the space of a hundred years. It binds CaiusPlautius your colleague, created under the same aus­pices, with the same privileges.

The shout which reached the post of Cornelius, withthe dust observed at a distance, excited a bustle andhurry in his camp. Ordering his men instantly toarms, and leading them out to the field with the utmosthaste, he charged the flank of the enemy's line, whichhad enough to do in the other dispute, at the same timeexclaiming, that ' it would be the height of infamy ifthey suffered Marcius' army to monopolise the honorof both victories, and did not assert their claim to theglory of their own war.' He bore down all beforehim, and pushed forward, through the midst of theenemy's line, to their camp, which, being left withouta guard, he took and set on fire ; and the flames of itbeing seen by the soldiers of Marcius, and likewise bythe enemy on their looking about, a general flight im­mediately took place among the Samnites. But theycould not effect an escape in any direction; in everyquarter they met death. After a slaughter of thirtythousand men, the consuls had now given the signal forretreat; and were collecting into one body their severalforces, who were employed in mutual congratulations,when some new cohorts of the enemy, which had beenlevied for a reinforcement, being seen at a distance, oc­casioned a renewal of the carnage. On these the con­querors rushed, without any order of the consuls, orsignal received, crying out that they would give theseSamnites an introduction to service, which they wouldnot like. The consuls indulged the ardor of the le­gions, well knowing that raw troops mixed with vete­rans dispirited by defeat would be incapable even ofattempting a contest. Nor were they wrong in theirjudgment: all the forces of the Samnites, old and new,fled to the nearest mountains. These the Roman armyalso ascended, so that no situation afforded safety tothe vanquished; they were beaten off, even from thesummits which they had seized. And now, they all,with one voice, supplicated for a suspension of arms.On which, being ordered to furnish corn for threemonths, pay for a year, and a tunic to each of the sol­diers, they sent deputies to the senate to sue for peace.

creed to Marcius. These, in the beginning, securedall the passes between the camps of the consul in sucha manner that no messenger, however expert, couldmake his way from one to the other; and each consulspent several days in absolute uncertainty, and inanxious suspense concerning the state of the other.Apprehensions for their safety spread even to Rome ;so that all the younger citizens were compelled to en­list, and two regular armies were raised to answer sud­den emergences. The conduct of the Herniciansduring the progress of the war afterwards showed no­thing suitable to the present alarm, or to the ancientrenown of that nation. Without ever making anyeffort worth mentioning, being beaten out of three dif­ferent camps within a few days, they stipulated for atruce of thirty days, during which they might send toRome, to the senate, on the terms of furnishing twomonths' pay, and corn, and a tunic to every soldier.The senate referred them back to Marcius, whom theyempowered to determine on the affair, and he acceptedtheir submission. Meanwhile, in Samnium, the otherconsul, though superior in strength, was very muchembarrassed by the nature of his situation : the enemyhad blocked up all the roads, and seized on the passa­ble defiles, so as to stop all supplies of provisions; norcould the consul, though he daily drew out his troopsand offered battle, allure them to an engagement. Itwas evident that neither could the Samnites support animmediate contest, nor the Romans a delay of action.The approach of Marcius, who, after he had subduedthe Hernicians, hastened to the succor of his colleague,put it 'out of the enemy's power any longer to avoidfighting: for they, who had not deemed themselves amatch in the field, even for one of the armies, conldsurely not suppose that if they should allow the twoconsular armies to unite, they could have any hoperemaining: they made an attack therefore on Marciusas he was approaching in the irregular order of march.The baggage was hastily thrown together in the centre,and the line formed as well as the time permitted.

consuls ; and it is mentioned that Volumnius was em­ployed at the time in Samnium ; that he compelled thearmy of the Samnites to retreat to Mount Tifernus,and not retarded by the difficulty of the ground routedand dispersed them. Quintus Fabius, leaving Decius'army in Etruria, and leading off his own legions to thecity, triumphed over the Gauls, Etrurians, and Sam­nites, the soldiers attending his triumph. These, intheir coarse military verses, celebrated not morehighly the conduct of Quintus Fabius, than the illus­trious death of Publius Decius ; recalling to memoryhis self-immolated father, of whom the son might beconsidered as a glorious counterpart, in respect of theissue which resulted both to himself and to the public.Out of the spoil donations were made to the soldiersof eighty-two asses1 to each, with cloaks and vests;rewards for service, which in that age were far fromcontemptible.
31. Notwithstanding these successes, peace was notyet established, either among the Samnites or Etru­rians : for the latter, at the instigation of the Peru-sians, resumed their arms as soon as the consul hadwithdrawn his troops ; and the Samnites made preda­tory incursions on the territories of Vescia and For-miaj; and also on the other side, on those of jEsernia,and the parts adjacent to the river Vulturnus. Againstthese was sent the pretor Appius Claudius, with thearmy formerly commanded by Decius. In Etruria,Fabius, on the revival of hostilities, slew four thou­sand five hundred of the Perusiaus, and took prisonersone thousand seven hundred and forty, who were ran­somed at the rate of three hundred and ten asses3 each.All the rest of the spoil was bestowed on the soldiers.The legions of the Samnites, though pursued, some bythe pretor Appius Claudius, the others by Lucius Vo­lumnius, proconsul, formed a junction in the countryof the Stellatians.

As for you, neither the expira­tion of the time of your censorship, nor the resignationof your colleague, nor law, nor shame restrains you.Your fortitude is arrogance ; your boldness is a con­tempt of gods and men. Appius Claudius, in consi­deration of the dignity of that office which you haveborne, and of the respect due to it, I should be sorrynot only to offer you personal violence, but even toaddress you in language too severe. With respectto what I have hitherto said, your pride and obstinacyforced me to speak. And now, unless you pay obe­dience to the iEmilian law, I shall order you to be ledto prison. Nor, since a rule has been established byour ancestors, that in the election of censors, unlesstwo shall obtain the legal number of suffrages, neithershall be returned, but the election deferred,—will Isuffer you, who could not singly be created censor, tohold the censorship without a colleague.' Havingspoken to this effect, he ordered the censor to beseized, and borne to prison. But although six of thetribunes approved of the proceeding of their colleague,three gave their support to Appius, on his appealingto them, and he held the censorship alone, to the greatdisgust of all ranks of men.

8. For some days following, while the general'swound was under cure, there was rather a blockadethan a siege. But although during this time there wasa cessation of arms, there was no intermission of thepreparations, either for attack or defence. Hostilitiestherefore commenced anew with a greater degree offury ; and the machines began to be advanced, and thebattering-rams to be brought up, in a greater numberof places; so that in some parts there was scarcelyroom for the works. The Carthaginian had greatabundance of men ; for it is credibly asserted that thenumber of his troops was not less than one hundredand fifty thousand: the townsmen were obliged to haverecourse to various shifts, in order, with their smallnumbers, to execute every necessary measure, and tomake defence in so many different places ; nor weretbey equal to the task : for now the walls began to bebattered with the rams; many parts of them were shat­tered ; in one place a large breach left the city quiteexposed: three towers, in one range, together with thewhole extent of wall between them, tumbled downwith a prodigious crash ; and so great was the breach,that the Carthaginians looked on the town as alreadytaken. On which, as if the wall had served equallyfor a covering to both parties, the two armies rushedto battle. Here was nothing like the disorderly kindof fight which usually happens in the assault of towns,each party acting as opportunity offers advantage, butregular lines were formed, as if in the open plain, onthe ground between the ruins of the walls and thebuildings of the city, which stood at no great distance.Their courage was animated to the greatest height; onone side by hope, on the other by despair: the Car­thaginian believing that only a few more efforts werenecessary to render him master of the place; the Sa­

devote the legions of his enemy, and himself, togetherwith them, to that party and nation the victory wouldfall.' The consuls having communicated to each otherthese visions of the night, determined that victimsshould be slain to avert the wrath of the gods; andalso, that if the portents, appearing in their entrails,concurred with what they had seen in their sleep, oneor other of the consuls should fulfil the will of thefates. Finding the answers of the auspices to agreewith the awful impressions already made on theirminds in private, they then called together the lieute­nant-generals and tribunes; and having made knownto them all the decrees of the gods, settled betweenthemselves that, lest the voluntary death of a consulmight dishearten the troops in the field, on whicheverside the Roman army should begin to give ground, theconsul commanding there should devote himself for theRoman people and for his country. In this consulta­tion it was also mentioned, that if ever strictness incommand had been enforced in any war, it was then,particularly, requisite that military discipline shouldbe brought back to the ancient model. Their attentionwas the.more strongly directed to this point by theconsideration that the enemies with whom they had todeal were the Latines, people who used the same lan­guage, and who had the same manners, the same kindof arms, and, what was more than all, the same mili­tary institutions as themselves: who had been inter­mixed with them in the same armies, after in the samecompanies, soldiers with soldiers, centurions with cen­turions, tribunes with tribunes, as comrades and col­leagues. Lest, in consequence of this, the soldiersmight be betrayed into any mistake, the consuls issuedorders - that no person should fight with any of theenemy except in his post.

arrival, or little regarding whether he were present orabsent, they marched out in order of battle. Of suchimportance however was that single man, Lucius Pa-pirius, that, had the zeal of the soldiers seconded thedispositions of the commander, no doubt was enter­tained that an end might have been put that day to thewar with the Samnites. He chose the best possibleposition for his troops, posted his body of reserve mostjudiciously, and strengthened them with every advan­tage which military skill could devise'; but the sol­diers exerted no vigor, and designedly kept from con­quering, in order to injure the reputation of theirleader. Of the Samnites, however, very many wereslain; and great numbers of the Romans wounded.The experienced commander quickly perceived the cir­cumstance which prevented his success, and that itwould be necessary to moderate his temper, and tomingle mildness with austerity. Accordingly, attendedby the lieutenants-general, he went round to the tentsof the wounded soldiers, inquiring of each the state ofhis health; then, mentioning them by name, he gavethem in charge to the officers, tribunes, and prefects,recommending them to their particular care. This be­havior, popular in itself, he maintained with such dex­terity, that by his attention to their recovery he gra­dually gained their affection; nor did any thing somuch contribute towards their recovery as the grati­tude excited by this humane condescension. As soonas the men were restored to health he came to an en­gagement with the enemy; and both himself and thetroops being possessed with full confidence of success,he so intirely defeated and dispersed the Samnites, thatthey never after that day met the dictator in the field.The victorious army afterwards directed its marchwherever a prospect of booty invited, and traversedtheir territories without a weapon being raised againstthem, or any opposition given, either openly or bystratagem. It added to their alacrity that the dictatorhad, by proclamation, given the whole spoil to thesoldiers; so that they were animated not only by the

The same too might have beenthe case with the Decii, who, after devoting their per­sons, rushed on the enemy; or of Papirius Cursor,though possessed of such powers, both of body andmind. The counsels of one youth, it is possible, mighthave baffled the wisdom of a whole senate, composedof such members, that he alone, who said it was anassembly of kings, conceived a just idea of it.

These horsemen observed one gate,and, at a little distance, another on the same side,standing wide open, and on the roads leading fromthese, every mark of the enemy having fled by night.They then rode up leisurely to the gates, from whencewith perfect safety they took a clear view throughstrait streets quite across the city. Returning to theconsul, they told him that the city was abandoned bythe enemy, as was plain from the solitude, the trackson their retreat, and the things which, in the confusionof the night, they had left scattered up and down.On hearing this, the consul led round the army to thatside of the city which had been examined, and, makingthe troops halt at a little distance from the gate, gave .orders that five horsemen should ride into the city ;and, when they should have advanced a good way intoit, then, if they saw all things safe, three should re­main there, and the other two return to him with in­telligence. These returned, and said that they hadproceeded to a part of the town from which they had aview on every side, and that nothing but silence andsolitude reigned through the whole extent of it. Theconsul immediately led some light-armed cohorts intothe city, ordering the rest to fortify a camp in themean time. The soldiers who entered the town, break­ing open the doors, found only a few persons disabledby age or sickness, and such effects remaining ascould not without difficulty be removed. These wereseized as plunder: and it was discovered from the pri­soners that several cities in that quarter had, in pur­suance of a concerted plan, resolved on flight; thattheir townspeople had gone off at the first watch, andthey believed that the same solitude would be foundin the other places. The accounts of the prisoner*proved well founded, and the consul took possessionof the forsaken towns.

So indefatigably, though unsuccess­fully, did they struggle in defence of liberty, andrather than not aspire after victory, chose to subjectthemselves to repeated defeats. Who does not find hispatience tired, either in writing or reading of wars ofsuch continuance, and which yet exhausted not theresolution of the parties concerned?
32. Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were suc­ceeded in the consulship by Lucius Postumius Megel-lus and Marcus Atilius Regulus. [A. U. C. 458. B. C.294.] The province of Samniutn was decreed to bothin conjunction; because intelligence had been receivedthat the enemy had embodied three armies; one forthe recovery of Etruria ; another, to repeat their ra­vages in Campania ; and the third, intended for thedefence of their frontiers. Sickness detained Postu-mius at Rome, but Atilius set out immediately, withdesign to surprise the enemy in Samnium, before theyshould have advanced beyond their own borders; forsuch had been the directions of the senate. The Ro­mans met the enemy, as if by mutual appointment, ata spot where, while they could be hindered, not onlyfrom ravaging, but even from entering the Samniteterritory, they could likewise binder the Samnitesfrom continuing their progress into the countries whichwere quiet, and the lands of the allies of the Romanpeople. While they lay opposite to each other, theSamnites attempted an enterprise, which the Romans,so often their conquerors, would scarcely have ven­tured to undertake ; such is the rashness inspired byextreme despair; this was an assault on the Romancamp. And although this attempt, so daring, suc­ceeded not in its full extent, yet it was not withoutconsiderable effect.

main body of the army before night. At the first light, onthe following day, he had gained the summit of MountCiminius, from whence having a view of the opulentplains of Etruria, he let loose his soldiers on them.When a vast body had been driven off, some tumul­tuary cohorts of Etrurian peasants, hastily collectedby the principal inhabitants of the district, met the Ro­mans ; but in such disorderly array, that these res-ouers of the prey were near becoming wholly a preythemselves. These being slain or put to flight, andthe country laid waste to a great extent, the Romansreturned to their camp victorious, and enriched withplenty of every kind. It happened, that in the meantime five deputies, with two plebeian tribunes, hadcome hither to charge Fabius, in the name of the se­nate, not to attempt to pass the Ciminian forest.These, rejoicing that they had arrived too late to pre­vent the expedition, returned to Rome with the newsof its success.
37. The consul, by this expedition, instead of bring­ing the war nearer to a conclusion, only spread it to awider extent; for all the tract adjacent to the foot ofMount Ciminius had felt his devastations ; and, out ofthe indignation conceived thereat, had roused to arms,not only the states of Etruria, but the neighboringparts of Umbria. They came therefore to Sutrium,with such a numerous army as they had never beforebrought into the field ; and not only ventured to en­camp on the outside of the wood, but earnestly desirousof coming to an engagement as soon as possible, marcheddown to the plains to offer battle. The troops beingmarshalled, stood at first, for some time, on their ownground, having left a space sufficient for the Romansto draw up opposite to them ; but perceiving that thesedeclined fighting,they advanced to the rampart; where,observing that even the advanced guards had retiredwithin the works, they at once began to iusist clamor­ously on their general's ordering provisions for thatday to be brought down to them: ' for they were re­solved to remain there under arms; and either in the

sincerity of that people, both on account of many in­stances of treacherous behavior, and particularly,though the others through length of time might havebeen forgotten, on account of the recent perfidy of theBoians. Sempronius, on the contrary, was of opi­nion that it would be the strongest tie on the fidelityof the allies to let them see that the first who stood inneed of aid had found protection. He then, while hiscolleague hesitated, despatched his own cavalry, joinedby one thousand foot, mostly light spearmen, over theTrebia, to protect the lands of the Gauls. These fall­ing unexpectedly on the enemy, while they werestraggling in disorder, and most of them loaded withspoil, caused great consternation, slew many, anddrove the rest flying before them to their camp.Though repulsed by the multitude which sallied out,yet, as soon as the rest of their party came up, theyagain renewed the fight. Success afterwards remaineddoubtful; sometimes they retreated, sometimes pur­sued ; but though at last the advantages were equalon both sides, yet the honor of the victory was moregenerally attributed to the Romans.

He was transportedwith joy, at having obtained a victory with that part ofthe troops which, under his associate, had been defeated.' The spirits of the soldiers,' he said ' were now re­vived ; nor was there any one, except his colleague,who wished a delay of action.

These fresh troopschecked the progress of the Samnites, who had nowbegan to gain ground ; and, at this seasonable juncture,their comrades appearing suddenly on the mountains,and raising a shout, occasioned in the Samnites a fearof greater danger than really threatened them: Fabiuscalled out aloud that his colleague Decius was ap­proaching ; on which all the soldiers, elated with joy,repeated eagerly that the other consul was come, thelegions were arrived! This artifice, while it produceda happy effect on the Romans, filled the Samnites withsuch dismay, that they thought of nothing but flight;for they dreaded above all things, lest, fatigued as theywere, they should be overpowered by another armyfresh and unhurt. As they dispersed themselves onevery side, there was less effusion of blood than mighthave been expected, considering the completeness ofthe victory. There were three thousand four hundredslain ; about three hundred and thirty made prisoners,and twenty-three military standards taken.

The Apulians would have joined their forces tothe Samnites before this battle had not the consul,Publius Decius, encamped in their neighborhood atMaleventum; and, finding means to bring them to anengagement, put them to the rout. Here, likewise,there was more of flight than of bloodshed. Two thou­sand of the Apulians were slain ; but Decius, despisingsuch an enemy, led his legions into Samnium. Therethe two consular armies, overrunning every part of thecountry during the space of five months, laid it intirelywaste. There were in Samnium forty-five places whereDecius, and eighty-six where the other consul, en­camped. Nor did they leave traces only of havingbeen there, as ramparts and trenches, but other dread­ful mementos of it—general desolation and regions de­populated.

through all parts of that country ; until, at last, hedrove the army of the Samnites, which never dared toface him in the field, intirely out of the country. Thusexpelled from home, they bent their route to Etruria ;and supposing that the business, which they had oftenin vain endeavored to accomplish by embassies, mightnow be negotiated with more effect, when they werebacked by such a powerful armed force, and could in­termix terror with their intreaties, they demanded ameeting of the chiefs of Etruria : which being assem­bled, they set forth the great number of years duringwhich they had waged war with the Romans, in thecause of liberty: ' they had,' they said, ' endeavored,with their own strength, to sustain the weight of sogreat a war: they had also made trial of the supportof the adjoining nations, which proved of little avail.Unable longer to maintain the conflict, they had suedto the Roman people for peace ; and had again takenup arms, because they felt peace, attended with servi­tude, more grievous than war with liberty. They hadone only hope remaining, which was the support whichthey expected from the Etrurians. They knew thatnation to be the most powerful in Italy, in respect ofarms, men, and money ; to have the Gauls their closestneighbors, born in the midst of war and arms, of furi­ous courage, both from their natural temper, and par­ticularly against the people of Rome, whom theyboasted, without infringing the truth; of having madetheir prisoners, and of having ransomed for gold.

The Samnites, thus assailedon every side, fled different ways. A vast number,who had gathered into a body through fear, yet fromconfusion incapable of acting, were surrounded andcut to pieces. The enemy's camp was taken and plun­dered ; and the soldiers being laden with the spoil, thedictator led them back to the Roman camp, highly re­joiced at the.success, but still more at finding, contraryto their expectation, every thing there safe, except asmall part only, which was injured or destroyed by thefire.

Fromhis answers to their questions respecting the means bywhich he intended to accomplish his design, it appearedto be not ill formed ; and he persuaded them to removethe Roman camp, which was almost close to the walls,to the distance of six miles; alleging that this wouldrender the guards by day and the watches by nightthe less vigilant.

Animated, then, by theprospect of so rich a spoil, take arms, with the favor ofthe gods. You have been hitherto employed in thepursuit of cattle through the waste mountains of Lusi-tania and Celtiberia, without any prospect of emolu­ment from so many toils and dangers. It is now timeto make profitable and rich campaigns ; and that, aftermeasuring such a length of way, through so manymountains and rivers, and so many armed nations, yoube at last abundantly rewarded for your labor. HereFortune has fixed the period of your toils; here, onyour finishing your course of service, will she giveyou ample retribution. And do not imagine the vic­tory to be as difficult as the character of the war isimportant. Often has a despised enemy maintained abloody contest, and renowned nations and kings beenvanquished by exertions of very moderate force : for,setting aside singly the present splendor of the Ro­man name, in what one particular are they to be com­pared with you? Not to mention your service, for thelast twenty years, performed with so great braveryand so great success, you have effected a march to thisplace from the pillars of Hercules, from the ocean, andthe remotest limits of the world ; opening your way,with your victorious arms, through so many of thefiercest nations of Spain and Gaul. You will nowfight with an army of raw troops, who during this verysummer were beaten, routed, and besieged by theGauls; who, as yet, neither know nor are known bytheir commanders. Ought I, if not born, at least edu­cated, in the very tent of that most illustrious generalmy father; I, who have subdued both Spain andGaul; the conqueror, likewise, not only of the Alpinetribes, but what is much more, of the Alps them­selves ; ought I to put myself in comparison with sucha commander as theirs; a general of six months'standing, who ran away from his own army; to whom,

sought not the employment at first, and afterwards,when he discovered their wishes, even declined it.' Why,' said he, ' should they impose such a difficulttask on him, who was now in the decline of life, andhad passed through a full course of labors, and of therewards of labor? Neither the vigor of his body, norof his mind, remained the same ; and he dreaded For­tune herself, lest some god should think her too bounti­ful to him, and more constant than the course of humanaffairs allowed. He had himself succeeded, in gradualsuccession, to the dignities of his predecessors; and hebeheld, with great satisfaction, others rising up to suc­ceed to his. There was no scarcity at Rome, either ofhonors suited to men of the highest merit, or of men ofeminent merit suited to the highest honors.' This dis­interested conduct, instead of repressing, increased,while in fact it justified their zeal. But thinking thatthis ought to be checked by respect for the laws, heordered that clause to be read aloud by which it is for­bidden that the same person shall be re-elected consulwithin ten years. Such a clamor now arose, that thelaw was scarcely heard ; and the tribunes of the com­mons declared that this ' decree should be no impedi­ment ; for they would propose an order to the people,that he should be exempted from the obligation of thelaws.' Still he persisted in his opposition, asking, ' Towhat purpose were laws enacted, if they were eludedby the very persons who procured them ? The lawsnow,' he said,1 instead of being rulers, were overruled.'The people, nevertheless, proceeded to vote; and, assoon as each century was called in, it immediatelynamed Fabius consul. Then at length, overcome bythe universal wish of the state, he said, ' Romans, maythe gods approve your present, and all your futureproceedings. But since with respect to me you intendto act according to your own wills, let my interest findroom with you with respect to my colleague.

marched to Caudium. The heralds, who went before,on coming to the gate, ordered the sureties of the peaceto be stripped of their clothes, and their hands to betied behind their backs. As the apparitor, out of re­spect to his dignity, was binding Postumius in a loosemanner, ' Nay,' said he, ' draw the cord tight that thesurrender may be regularly performed.' Then, whenthey came into the assembly of the Samnites, and tothe tribunal of Pontius, Aulus Cornelius Arvina, aherald, pronounced these words : ' Forasmuch as thesemen here present, without orders from the Roman peo­ple, the Quirites, entered into surety that a treatyshould be made, whereby they have rendered them­selves criminal; now, in order that the Roman peoplemay be freed from the crime of impiety, I here sur­render these men into your hands.' On the heraldsaying thus, Postumius gave him a stroke on the thighwith his knee, as forcibly as he could, and said with aloud voice, that ' he was now a citizen of Samnium,the other a Roman ambassador; that the herald hadbeen by him violently ill treated, contrary to the lawof nations ; and that the people he represented wouldtherefore have the more justice on their side in thewar which they were about to wage.'
11. Pontius then said, ' Neither will I accept such asurrender, nor will the Samnites deem it valid. Spu-rius Postumius, if you believe that there are gods,why do you not undo all that has been done, or fulfilyour agreement? The Samnite nation is intitled,either to all the men whom it had in its power, or, in­stead of them, to a peace. But why do I make a de­mand on yon, who, with as much regard to faith asyou are able to show, return yourself a prisoner intothe hands of the conqueror? I make the demand onthe Roman people. If they are dissatisfied with theconvention made at the Caudine forks, let them re­place the legions within the defile where they werepent up. Let there be no deception on either side.

madness. The enemy therefore were completely routed,not even daring to retreat to their camp, but dis­persing, made the best of their way towards Apulia:afterwards, however, they collected their forces intoone body and came to Luceria. The same exaspera­tion which had carried the Romans through the midstof the enemy's line carried them forward also intotheir camp, where greater carnage was made, andmore blood spilt than even in the field, while thegreater part of the spoil was destroyed in their rage.The other army, with the consul Papirius, had nowarrived at Arpi, on the sea-coast, having passed with­out molestation through all the countries in their way ;which was owing to the ill treatment received by thosepeople from the Samnite's, and their hatred towardsthem, rather than to any favor received from the Ro­man people : for such of the Samnites as dwelt on themountains used to ravage the low lands and the placeson the coast; and being savage themselves, despisedthe husbandmen who were of a gentler kind. Now thepeople of this tract, had they been favorably affectedtowards the Samnites, could either have prevented theRoman army from coming to Arpi; or, as they lay be­tween Rome and Arpi, could, by intercepting the con­voys of provisions, have caused such scarcity of everynecessary as would have been fatal. Even as it was,when they went from thence to Luceria, both the be­siegers and the besieged were distressed equally by want.Every kind of supplies was brought to the Romansfrom Arpi, but in a very scanty proportion, the horsemencarrying corn from thence to the camp in little bags forthe foot, who were employed in the outposts, watches,and works, and these sometimes falling in with parties ofthe enemy, when they were obliged to throw the cornfrom off their horses, in order to fight. With respectto the Samnites, before the arrival of the other consuland his victorious army, provisions and reinforcementshad been brought in to them from the mountains;but the coming of Publilius strengthened the Romansin every part; for, committing the siege to the care of

greatest courage; nor did victory declare itself untilthe second line of the Romans came up fresh to thefront, in the place of the first, who were much fatigued.The Etrurian line not being supported by any freshreserves, all before and round the standards wereslain, and in no battle whatever would have been seena nobler stand, or a greater effusion of human blood,had not the night sheltered the Etrurians, who wereresolutely determined to resist to death ; so that thevictors, not the vanquished, were the first who desistedfrom fighting. After sunset the signal for retreat wasgiven, and both parties retired in the night to theircamps. During the remainder of the year nothingmemorable was effected at Sutrium ; for of the enemy'sarmy, the whole first line had been cut off, the re­serves only being left, who were scarce sufficient toguard the camp ; and, among the Romans, a greaternumber died of their wounds than had fallen in thefield.
33. Quintus Fabius, consul for the ensuing year,[A.U. C. 444. B.C. 308] succeeded to the commandof the army at Sutrium : the colleague given to himwas Caius Marcius Rutilus. On the one side, Fabiusbrought with him a reinforcement from Rome, and onthe other, a new army had been sent for, and came fromhome to the Etrurians. Many years had now passedwithout any disputes between the patrician magistratesand plebeian tribunes, when a contest took its rise fromthat family, which seemed raised by fate as antagoniststo the tribunes and commons of those times ; AppiusClaudius being censor, when the eighteen months hadexpired, which was the time limited by the /Emilianlaw for the duration of the censorship, although hiscolleague Caius Plautius had already resigned hisoffice, could not be prevailed on by any means to giveup his. There was a tribune of the commons, PubliusSempronius, who undertook to enforce the terminationof the censorship within the lawful time by means of alegal process, which was not more popular than just,nor more pleasing to the people generally than to

were, than for the unanimity which had ever subsistedbetween them. The interruption which this afterwardssuffered was, in my opinion, owing to a jarring be­tween the opposite parties rather than between them­selves ; the patricians endeavoring that Fabius shouldhave Etruria for-bis province, without casting lots, andthe plebeians insisting that Decius should bring thematter to the decision of lots. There was certainly acontention in the senate, and the interest of Fabiusbeing superior there, the business was brought beforethe people. Here, between military men who laidgreater stress on deeds than on words, the debate wasshort. Fabius said ' that it was unreasonable that afterhe had planted a tree another should gather the fruitof it. He had opened the Ciminian forest, and made away for the Roman arms through passes until thenimpracticable. Why had they disturbed his repose atthat time of his life, if they intended to give the manage­ment of the war to another?' Then, in the way of agentle reproof, he observed, that ' instead of an asso­ciate in command, he had chosen an adversary; andthat Decius thought it too much that their unanimityshould last through three consulates.' Declaring, infine, that ' he desired nothing farther than that, ifthey thought him qualified for the command in theprovince, they should send him thither. He had sub­mitted to the judgment of the senate, and would nowbe governed by the authority of the people.' PubliusDecius complained of injustice in the senate ; and as­serted that ' the patricians had labored as long as pos­sible to exclude the plebeians from all access to thehigher honors; and since merit, by its own intrinsicpower, had prevailed so far as that it should not in anyrank of men be precluded from the attainment of them,they sought every expedient to render ineffectual, notonly the suffrages of the people, but even the decisionsof fortune, converting all things to the aggrandisementof a few.

and whatever is dear to you, if any choose to visityour friends, I now give you leave of absence. At thebeginning of spring I charge you to attend here, inorder that, with the aid of the gods, we may enter ona war, from which we shall reap abundance both ofhonor and riches.' This voluntary offer of leave torevisit their homes was highly pleasing to almost everyone of them ; for they already longed to see theirfriends, and foresaw a longer absence from them likelyto happen. This interval of rest renewed the powersof their minds and bodies, enabling them to encounterevery hardship anew; for the fatigues they had al­ready sustained, and those they were soon to undergo,appeared to be little thought of. At the beginning ofspring they therefore assembled, according to orders.Hannibal, after reviewing the auxiliaries of the severalnations, went to Gades, where he fulfilled his vows toHercules, and bound himself in new ones, in case hisfuture operations should be crowned with success.Then dividing his attention between the measures re­quisite for annoying the enemy and those necessaryfor defence, lest, while he should be making his wayto Italy by land through Spain and Gaul, Africa shouldbe naked and open to an attack of the Romans fromSicily, he resolved to provide for its security by send­ing thither a strong body of forces. In the room ofthese he required a reinforcement to be sent to himfrom Africa, consisting chiefly of light-armed spear­men. This he did with the view that the Africansserving in Spain, and the Spaniards in Africa, whereeach would be better soldiers at a distance fromhome, they might be, as it were, mutual hostagesfor the good behavior of each other. He sent intoAfrica, of infantry, thirteen thousand eight hundredand fifty targeteers, with eight hundred and seventyBalearic slingers ; of cavalry, collected from many na­tions, one thousand two hundred. Part of these forceshe ordered to garrison Carthage, the rest to be distri­buted through Africa. At the same time he orderedfour thousand chosen young men, whom he had en­

47. The favor of the consul saved from a trial, be­fore the people, Postumius; who, on a prosecutionbeing commenced against him by Marcus Scantius,plebeian tribune, evaded, as was said, the jurisdictionof the people, by procuring the commission of lieute­nant-general, so that he could only be threatened withit. The year having now elapsed, new plebeian tri­bunes had come into office ; and even these, in conse­quence of some irregularity in their appointments,had, within five days after, others substituted in theirroom. The lustrum was closed this year by the cen­sors Publius Cornelius Arvina and Caius Marcius Ru-tilus. The number of citizens rated was two hundredand sixty-two thousand three hundred and twenty-two.These were the twenty-sixth pair of censors since thefirst institution of that office ; and this the nineteenthlustrum. In this year persons who had been presentedwith crowns, in consideration of meritorious behaviorin war, first began to wear them at the exhibition ofthe Roman games. At the same time was first intro­duced from Greece the practice of bestowing palms onthe victors in the games. In the same year the curuleediles, who exhibited those games, completed thepaving of the road from the temple of Mars to Bovillae,out of fines levied on the farmers of the public pas­tures. Lucius Papirius presided at the consular elec­tion, and returned consuls Quintus Fabius Gurges,son of Maximus, and Decius Junius Brutus Scacva.Papirius himself was made pretor. The many pros­perous events of this year were scarcely sufficient toaflford consolation for one calamity, a pestilence, whichafflicted both the city and country, and caused a pro­digious mortality. To discover what end, or what re­medy was appointed by the gods for that calamity,the books were consulted, and there it was found thatjEsculapius must be brought to Rome from Epidaurus.However, as the consuls had full employment in thewars, no farther steps were taken in that business dur­ing this year, except the performing a supplication tojEsculapius of one day's continuance.

nians, the only Gallic state that continued faithful totheir cause. This was the force employed in that en­gagement. The battle was begun by the Balearians;who being too powerfully opposed by the legions, thelight-armed troops were hastily drawn off to the wings;which circumstance proved the cause of the Roman ca­valry being quickly overpowered ; for being in numberbut four thousand, they had before been hardly able tomaintain their ground against ten thousand; especiallyas they were fatigued, and the others- mostly fresh;but now they were overwhelmed under a cloud, as itwere, of javelins thrown by the Balearians. Besidesthis, the elephants, advancing in the extremities of thewings, so terrified the horses, as to occasion a generalrout. The fight between the infantry was maintainedby an equality of spirit rather than of strength : for,with respect to the latter, the Carthaginians hadbrought theirs fresh into the battle, invigorated byfood ; the Romans, on the contrary, were enfeebled byfasting and fatigue, and their limbs stiffened and be­numbed with cold. They would, notwithstanding, havemaintained their ground by dint of courage, had theconflict rested solely between them and the infantry.But the Balearians, after the discomfiture of the ca­valry, poured darts on their flanks, and the elephantshad now made their way to the centre of the line ofthe infantry; while Mage, with his Numidians, as soonas the army had passed by their lurking place withoutobserving them, started up at once, and caused dread­ful confusion and terror in the rear.
56. Encompassed by so many perils, the line, not­withstanding, stood for a long time unbroken, even(which was most surprising to all) by the attack of theelephants. The light infantry, stationed for that pur­pose, plying these briskly with iron javelins, madethem turn back ; and then, following them behind,darted their weapons into them under the tails, inwhich part, the'skin being softest, it is easy to woundthem. When they were by these means put into dis­order, and ready to vent their fury on their own party,

they first began to be frightened when, the raft beingset loose, they were separated from the rest, and draggedinto the deep: then pressing close to one another, asthose on the outside drew back from the water, theyoccasioned a good deal of disorder; but terrified byseeing the water on every side of them, they soon be-. came quiet. Some, indeed, becoming outrageous, tum­bled into the river, but their own weight renderingthem steady, though their riders were thrown off, theycautiously searched out the shallow parts, and camesafe to land.
29. While thus employed in transporting the ele­phants, Hannibal had despatched five hundred Numi-dian horsemen towards the camp of the Romans, todiscover where they lay, what were their numbers,and, if possible, what their designs. This detachmentof cavalry was met by the three hundred Roman horsesent, as mentioned above, from the mouth of the Rhone.A battle ensued, more furious than common, betweensuch small numbers ; for, besides many wounds, therewas a great loss of lives, nearly equal on both sides,and it was not until the Romans were thoroughlyfatigued that the dismay and flight of the Numidiansyielded them the victory. On the side of the conquerorsfell one hundred and sixty, not all Romans however,some of them being Gauls ;' and of the vanquished morethan two hundred. As this prelude, and omen like­wise of the war, portended to the Romans a favorableissue on the whole, so did it a victory not unbloody,nor to be purchased without a dangerous struggle.After this action the parties returned to their re­spective commanders. On the one hand, Scipio couldform no determination, farther than to regulate bismeasures by the designs and proceedings of the enemy ;and, on the other, Hannibal was in doubt whether heshould continue his march into Italy without intermis­sion, or come to an engagement with the first Romanarmy that threw itself in his way. However, from thethoughts of an immediate engagement he was divertedby the arrival of ambassadors from the Boians, and of

Thereis no doubt about the name of Lutatius ; but some an­nals, instead of Caius Servilius and Titus Annius, haveQuintus Acilius and Caius Herennius: others, Eub-lius Cornelius Asina, and Caius Papirius Maso. Thereis also an uncertainty whether ambassadors, sent toexpostulate with the Boians, suffered violence, orwhether the ill treatment was offered to the commis­sioners who were measuring out the lands. Whilethey were shut up in Mutina, and the besiegers, a peo­ple quite unskilled in the arts of attacking towns, andremarkably lazy with respect to all military opera­tions, lay inactive round the walls, which they couldnot injure, a pretended treaty for an accommodationwas set on foot, and the ambassadors being invited outto a conference by the chiefs of the Gauls, were, inviolation not only of the laws of nations, but of thefaith pledged on the occasion, seized and put into con­finement, the Gauls declaring that they would not setthem at liberty unless their own hostages were re­turned to them. On hearing of this treatment of theambassadors, and the danger which threatened Mutinaand the garrison, Lucius Manlius, the pretor, inflamedwith resentment, led his army in a rapid march to­wards that city. The ground, on both sides of theroad, was at that time covered with woods, and. mostlyuninhabited. Advancing into these places, withouthaving examined the country, he fell into an ambush,and with much difficulty, after losing a great numberof men, made his way into the open plains. Here befortified a camp, which the Gauls not having resolu­tion to attack, the soldiers recovered their spirits,though it was evident that their strength was greatlydiminished: they then began their march anew, and,as long as their road lay through open grounds, theenemy never appeared ; but falling on their rear, whenthe Romans again entered the woods, they threw aliinto fright and confusion, slew eight hundred soldiers,

and there were slain in the assault about four hundredand thirty. Going thenoe to Rome to preside at theelections, he used all expedition in despatching thatbusiness. All the first-called centuries voted QuintusFabius consul. Appius Claudius was a candidate, aman of consular rank, daring and ambitious; and ashe wished not more ardently for the attainment of thathonor for himself, than he did that the patricians mightrecover the possession of both places in the consulship,he labored, with all his own power, supported by thatof the whole body of the nobility, to prevail on themto appoint him consul along with Quintus Fabius. Tothis Fabius objected, giving at first the same reasonswhich be had advanced the year before. The noblesthen all gathered round his seat, and besought him toraise up the consulship out of the plebeian mire, andto restore both to the office itself, and to the patricianrank, their original dignity. Fabius then procuringsilence, allayed their warmth by a qualifying speech,declaring that ' he would have so managed as to havereceived the names of two patricians, if he had seen anintention of appointing any other than himself to theconsulship. As things now stood, he would not set sobad a precedent as to admit his own name among thecandidates; such a proceeding being contrary to thelaws.' [A. U. C. 456. B. C. 296.] Whereon AppiusClaudius and Lucius Volumnius, a plebeian, who hadlikewise been colleagues in that office before, wereelected consuls. The nobility reproached Fabius fordeclining to act in conjunction with Appius Claudius,because he evidently excelled him in eloquence andpolitical abilities.

Flavius, on occasion of the funeral of his mother.There were many who represented that, under the ap­pearance of doing honor to his parent, he was makingrecompense to the people for having acquitted him,when prosecuted by the ediles on a charge of havingdebauched a married woman. This donative, intendedas a return for favors shown on the trial, proved alsothe means of procuring him the honor of a public office;for, at the next election of plebeian tribunes, thoughabsent, he was preferred before the candidates who so­licited in person. The city Palaepolis was situated atno great distance from the spot where Neapolis nowstands. The two cities were inhabited by one people :these came from Cumae, and the Cumans derive theirorigin from Chalcis in Euboea. By means of the fleetin which they had been conveyed hither they pos­sessed great power on the coast of the sea, near whichthey dwelt. Their first landing was on the islands ofjEnaria, and the Pithacnsae : afterwards they venturedto transfer their settlement to the continent. This state,relying on their own strength, and also on the'disposi­tion of the Samnites to come to a rupture with the Ro­mans ; or, encouraged by the report of a pestilencehaving attacked the city of Rome, committed variousacts of hostility against the Romans settled in the Cam-panian and Falernian territories. Wherefore, in thesucceeding consulate of Lucius Cornelius and QuintusPublilius Philo a second time, [A.U.C. 428.

On settlingthe provinces between the consuls, the war against theGreeks fell to Publilius.

was consequently attacked on the rear, and surroundedby several battalions, who pressed it on all sides.Some writers say that the whole were cut off, so thatnot one survived to give an account of the disaster;and that no information of the misfortune reached theconsuls, who were at the time not far from Clusium,until the Gallic horsemen came within vsight, carryingthe heads of the slain ; some hanging before theirhorses' breasts, others on the points of their spears,and expressing their triumph in songs, according totheir custom. Others affirm that the defeat was byUmbrians, not Gauls, and that the loss sustained wasnot so great: that a party of foragers, under LuciusManlius Torquatus, lieutenant-general, being sur­rounded, Scipio, the propretor, brought up relief fromthe camp, and, renewing the battle, defeated the Um­brians lately victorious, and retook, the prisoners andspoil. But it is more probable that this blow was suf­fered from a Gallic than an Umbrian enemy ; becauseduring that year, as was often the case at other times,the danger principally apprehended by the public wasthat of a Gallic tumult; for which reason, notwith­standing that both the consuls had marched against theenemy, with four legions and a large body of Romancavalry, joined by a thousand chosen horsemen ofCampania, supplied on the occasion, and a body of theallies and Latine confederates, superior in number tothe Romans, two other armies were posted near thecity, on the side facing Etruria, one in the Faliscian,the other in the Vatican territory, Cneins Fulvius andLucius Postumins Me'gellus, both propretors, beingordered to keep the troops stationed in those places.
27. The consuls, having crossed the Apennines,came up with the combined forces in the territory ofSentinum, and pitched their camp distant from themabout four miles. Several councils were then held bythe enemy, and their plan of operations was thus set­tled : that they should not encamp together, nor goout together to battle: the Gauls were united to theSammies; the Umbrians to the Etrurians.

In a battle fought by the cavalry, the onlypart of my forces which had an opportunity of fight"ing, the enemy was routed ; and because I could noton land overtake their body of infantry, which wascarried away with all the rapidity of flight, I returnedto my ships ; and, with the utmost expedition that Icould make, through such a long circuit by sea andland, I have met him ,at the foot of the Alps. Now,whether do I appear to have fallen in unawares withthis formidable foe, while I wished to decline a contestwith him, or to have designedly thrown myself in theway of his route, to challenge and force him to a trialof strength ? I feel a strong desire to try whether, inthese twenty years past, the earth has all at once pro­duced a new breed of Carthaginians ; or whether theyare the same with those who fought at the islandsJEgates, whom you ransomed at Eryx at a valuationof eighteen denarii1 a head ; and whether this Hanni­bal be, as he represents himself, another Hercules,equally renowned for his expeditions, or one left byhis father a subject, a tributary, and slave to the Ro-1man people ; who, if he were not struck with madness,as a punishment for the guilt of his behavior at Sagun-tum, would reflect, if not on the conquest of his coun­try, at least on the acts of his own family; on his fa­ther, on the treaties written by the hand of Hamilcar;who, in obedience to the commands of our consul,withdrew his forces from Eryx ; who, agitated withextreme sorrow, accepted the burdensome conditionsimposed on the conquered Carthaginians, and signedan engagement to evacuate Sicily, and to pay tributeto the Roman people. Wherefore, soldiers, I wishthat you may fight, not only with the same spirit whichyou usually show against other foes, but with a degreeof resentment and indignation, as if you saw your ownslaves suddenly taking arms against you.

Nor was the insur­rection of the Umbrians slighted at Rome: their verythreats excited fears among the people, who had expe­rienced, in the calamities suffered from the .Gauls, theinsecurity of the city wherein they resided. Deputieswere therefore despatched to the consul Fabius withdirections that, if he had any respite from the war ofthe Samnites, he should with all haste lead his armyinto Umbria. The consul obeyed the order, and byforced marches proceeded to Mevania, where the forcesof the Umbrians then lay. The unexpected arrival ofthe consul, whom they had believed to be sufficientlyemployed in Samnium, far distant from their country,so thoroughly affrighted the Umbrians, that several ad­vised retiring to their fortified towns; others, the layingaside their arms. However, one district, called^ bythemselves Materina, prevailed on the rest not only toretain their arms, but to come to an immediate engage­ment. They fell on Fabius while he was fortifying hiscamp. When the consul saw them rushing impetu­ously towards his rampart, he called off his men fromthe work, and drew them up in the best manner whichthe nature of the place and the time allowed ; en­couraged them by displaying, in honorable and justterms, the glory which they had acquired, as well inEtruria as in Samnium, and bade them finish this in­significant appendage to the Etrurian war, and takevengeance for the impious expressions in which thesepeople had threatened to attack the city of Rome. Suchwas the alacrity of the soldiers on hearing this that,raising the shout spontaneously, they interrupted thegeneral's discourse, and, without waiting for orders,advanced, with the sound of all the trumpets and cornets,in full speed against the enemy. They made their attacknot as on men, or at least men in arms, but, what must

have presented myself before you, as I would not ap­pear in the character either of a deputy from Hannibal,or of a deserter. But since he has remained with yourenemy, either through his own fault, or yours : throughhis own, if he counterfeited fear; through yours, if hewho tells you truth is to be punished : I have come toyou, out of my regard to the ties of hospitality so longsubsisting between us, in order that you should not beignorant that there are certain conditions on which youmay obtain both peace and safety. Now, that what Isay is merely out of regard to your interest, and notfrom any other motive, this alone is sufficient proof:that, so long as you were able to maintain a defence byyour own strength, or so long as you had hopes of suc­cor from the Romans, I never once mentioned peace toyou. Now, when you neither have any hopes fromthe Romans, nor can rely for defence either on yourarms or walls, I bring you terms of peace, ratherunavoidable than favorable. And there may be somechance of carrying these into effect, on this condition,that, as Hannibal dictates them, in the spirit of a con­queror, so you should listen to them with the spirit ofmen conquered : that you consider not what you partwith as loss, for all things are the property of the victor,but whatever is left to you as a gift. The city, a greatpart of which is already demolished, and almost thewhole of which he has in his possession, he takes fromyou : your lands he leaves to you, intending to assigna place where you may build a new town: all yourgold and silver, both public and private property, heorders to be brought to him : your persons, with thoseof your wives and children, he preserves inviolate, pro­vided you are satisfied to quit Saguntum without arms,and with single garments. These are the terms which,as a victorious enemy, he enjoins: with these, grievousand afflicting as they are, your present circumstancescounsel yon to comply. I do not indeed despair butthat, when the intire -disposal of every thing is givenup to him, he may remit somewhat of the severity ofthese'articles. But even these, I think it advisable to

Do you choose, onthe contrary, and in conformity to the practice of yourancestors, to augment the Roman state, by receivingthe vanquished into the number of your citizens !Here is a large addition which you may acquire, bymeans which will redound most highly to your glory.That government which the subjects feel happy inobeying stands certainly on the firmest of all founda­tions. But whatever your determination may be, it isnecessary that it be speedy ; as all those 'states are,at present, suspended between hope and fear. It istherefore of importance that you should be dischargedas soon as possible from all solicitude concerningthem ; and also that, either by punishment or cle­mency, an immediate impression be made on theirminds, before they recover from the state of insensi­bility into which the uncertainty of their fate hasthrown them. It was our part to bring the businessto such an issue that your deliberations concerning itshould be unrestrained in every particular. It is nowyours to determine what is most advantageous to your­selves and the commonwealth.'

The principal members of the senate highly ap­proved of the consul's statement of the business, onthe whole ; but said, that ' as the states were differentlycircumstanced, it would conduce to an easy adjustmentof the plan, so as that their resolutions should be con­formable to the several merits of each, if he put thequestion on the case of each state separately.' Thequestion was accordingly put, and a decree passedwith respect to each singly.

nation in Rome that people supposed the enemy wouldcome directly to attack the city; and they could seeno hope nor aid to enable them to repel an assaultfrom the walls and gales. One consul had been de­feated at the Ticinns, the other recalled from Sicily;and now that both the consuls, and two consular armieshad been defeated, what other commanders, what otherlegions were there whom they could call to their sup­port ? While they were possessed by such despondingfears the consul Sempronius arrived: for though theenemy's cavalry were scattered over the whole face ofthe country in search of plunder, yet he had passedthrough the midst of them with the utmost hazard, andwith a greater degree of boldness than of prudence ; orof hope either of escaping notice, or of being able tomake resistance in case he were discovered. Afterholding the election of consuls, the only business whichrendered his presence particularly necessary at thetime, he returned to his winter quarters. The consulselected were Cneius Servilius and Caius Flaminius.Even in their winter quarters the Romans were notallowed to rest, the Numidian cavalry spreading them­selves round on every side ; the Celtiberians and Lusi-tanians doing the same where the ground was too diffi­cult for the horse; so that no provisions of any kindcould be brought in, except what were conveyed onthe Po in ships. There was near Placentia a maga­zine, fortified with strong works, and supplied with anumerous garrison. In hopes of gaining possession ofthis stronghold, Hannibal marched at the head of hiscavalry and light infantry; and judging that the suc­cess of the enterprise would depend principally on thedesign being kept secret, made the attack by night;but he did not escape the vigilance of the guards, as ashout was instantly raised so loud that it was heardeven at Placentia. In consequence of this the consulcame to the spot before day with his cavalry, havingordered the legions to follow in order of battle. Mean­while the action began between the cavalry, in which

the auspex, wounded by a random cast of a javelin,fell before the standards; which being told to the con­sul, he said, ' The gods are present in the battle; theguilty has met his punishment.' While the consuluttered these words a crow, in front of him, cawedwith a clear voice ; at which augury the consul beingrejoiced, and affirming that never had the gods dis­played more evident demonstrations of their interposi­tion in human affairs, ordered the charge to be sounded'and the shout to be raised.
41. A furious conflict now ensued, but with veryunequal spirit in the combatants. The Romans, ac­tuated by anger, hope, and ardor for conquest, rushedto battle like men thirsting for their enemy's blood;while the Samnites, for the most part reluctantly, as ifcompelled by necessity and religious dread, ratherstood on their defence than made an attack. Nor wouldthey, familiarised as they were to defeats through acourse of so many years, have withstood the first shoutand shock of the Romans, had not another fear, ope­rating still more powerfully in their breasts, restrainedthem from flying: for they had before their eyes thewhole scene exhibited at the secret sacrifice; the armedpriests; the promiscuous carnage of men and cattle;the altars besmeared with blood of victims, and oftheir murdered countrymen ; the dreadful curses, andthe direful form of imprecation, in which they hadcalled down perdition on their family and race. Thusshackled, they stood in their posts, more afraid of theircountrymen than of the enemy. The Romans pushingthe attack with vigor on both the Wings, and in thecentre, made great havoc among them, deprived asthey were of the use of their faculties through theirfears of the gods and of men, and making but a faintopposition. The slaughter had now almost reached totheir standards, when, on one side, appeared a cloudof dust, as if raised by the marching of a numerousarmy: this was caused by Spurius Nautius, (some sayOctavius Metius,) commander of the auxiliary cohorts ;for these took pains to raise a great quantity of dust,

ing him, a decree was made ' that Brutulus Papiusshould be delivered into the hands of the Romans; andthat, together with him, all the spoil taken from theRomans and the prisoners should be sent to Rome,and that the restitution demanded by the heralds, inconformity to treaty, should be made, as was agreeableto justice and equity.' In pursuance of this determi­nation heralds were sent to Rome, and also the deadbody of Brutulus; for, by a voluntary death, he avoidedthe punishment and ignominy intended for him. Itwas thought proper that his goods also should be de­livered up along with the body. But none of all thosethings were accepted, except the prisoners, and sucharticles of the spoil as were recognised by the owners.The dictator obtained a triumph by a decree of thesenate.
40. Some writers affirm that the consuls had the con­duct of this war, and that they triumphed over the Sam-nites; and also, that Fabius advanced into Apulia, andcarried off from thence abundance of spoil. But thatAulus Cornelius was dictator that year is an undis­puted fact. The question then is, whether he was ap­pointed for the purpose of conducting the war, or onoccasion of the illness of Lucius Plautius, the pretor,in order that there might be a magistrate to give thesignal for the starting of the chariots at the Romangames. This latter is asserted of him ; and that afterperforming the' business, which in truth reflected nogreat lustre on his office, he resigned the dictatorship.It is not easy to determine between either the facts orthe writers, which of them deserves the preference : Iam persuaded that history has been much corrupted bymeans of funeral panegyrics, and false inscriptions onmonuments; each family striving by false representa­tions to appropriate to itself the fame of warlike ex­ploits and public honors. From this cause, certainly,much confusion has taken place, both in the memoirsof individuals, and in the public records of events. Noris there extant any writer, contemporary with thoseevents, on whose authority we can with certainty rely.

ranks, prayed thus: • Bellona, if thou grantest us thevictory this day, I vow to thee a temple.' And thatafter this vow, as if inspirited by the goddess, he dis­played a degree of courage equal to that of his col­league, and of the troops. The generals performedevery duty, and each of their armies exerted, withemulation, its utmost vigor, lest the other should befirst victorious. They therefore quickly broke anddefeated the enemy, who were ill able to withstand aforce so much superior to any with which they hadbeen accustomed to contend: then pressing them asthey gave ground, and pursuing them closely as theyfled, they drove them into their camp. There Gelliuaand his Samnite cohorts interposing, the fight was re­newed for a time with some warmth. But these beinglikewise soon dispersed, the conquerors advanced tostorm the camp ; and Volumnius, in person, leadinghis troops against one of the gates, while Appius, fre­quently invoking Bellona the victorious, inflamed thecourage of his men, neither rampart nor trenchescould prevent their breaking in. The camp was takenand plundered, and the spoil, of which great abun­dance was found, was given up to the soldiers. Ofthe enemy seven thousand three hundred were slain ;and two thousand one hundred and twenty taken.
20. While both the consuls, with the whole force ofthe Romans, pointed their exertions principally againsttheir enemies in Etruria, a new army was set on footin Samnium ; and, with design to ravage the frontiersof the Roman empire, passed over through the coun­try of the Vescians into the Campanian and Faler-nian territories, where they committed great depreda­tions. Volumnius, as he was hastening back to Sam­nium, by forced marches, because the term for whichFabius and Decius had been continued in commandwas nearly expired, heard of this army of Samnites,and of the mischief which they had done in Campania;determining, therefore, to afford protection to the al­lies, he altered his route towards that quarter.

boldened by the recollection of their former successesnear that very spot, and by confidence in the numberand bravery of their men.
50. When they got info the open sea, the Romansshowed a desire of coming up with the enemy, andtrying their strength with them in close fight. TheCarthaginians, on the contrary, wished to elude theirattacks, to effect the business by skill, not by force,and to make it a contest of ships, not of men or arms:for there was on board their fleet an abundance ofmariners, but a scarcity of soldiers, and when a shipwas grappled, their number of fighting men to defendit was by no means equal to that of the enemy. Thiscircumstance being discovered, the Romans assumedadditional courage from the fulness of their numbers ;and while the others were dispirited by their deficiencyin that respect, seven Carthaginian ships were quicklysurrounded, and the rest betook themselves to flight.In the captured ships, there were of soldiers and mari­ners one thousand seven hundred, among whom werethree Carthaginian nobles. The Roman fleet withoutloss returned into the harbor, one ship only beingbulged, and even that brought into port. Very soonafter this battle, before those who were at Messana hadheard of it, Tiberius Sempronius, the consul, came tothat city. On his entering the strait, king Hiero,with a fleet completely equipped, sailed to meet him,and going from the royal galley on board that of theconsul, congratulated him on his safe arrival with hisships and army. After praying for a successful andhappy issue to his expedition into Sicily, he repre­sented to him the state of the island and the attemptlately made by the Carthaginians, assuring him that, ashe had in the early part of his life supported the Romanpeople in the former war, so would he now, advancedas he was in years, support them still with the samedegree of spirit; that he would, at his own expense,furnish the consul's legions, and the crews of his ships,with corn and clothing; and then, acquainting him that

which conduct he inspired his soldiers with ardor tomeet both toil and danger. Quintus Fabius, procon­sul, fought a pitched battle with the armies of theSamnites, near the city of Allifae. The victory wascomplete. The enemy were driven from the field, andpursued to their camp; nor would they have keptpossession of that had not the day been almost spent.It was invested however before night, and guardeduntil day, lest any should slip away. Next morning,while it was scarcely clear day, they proposed to capi­tulate, and it was agreed that such as were natives ofSamnium should be dismissed with single garments.AH those were sent under the yoke. No precautionwas taken in favor of the allies of the Samnites : theywere sold by auction, to the number of seven thousand.Those who declared themselves subjects of the Herni-cians were kept by themselves under a guard. Allthese Fabius sent to Rome to the senate; and, afterbeing examined, whether it was in consequence of apublic order, or as volunteers, that they had carriedarms on the side of the Samnites against the Romans,they were distributed among the states of the Latinesto be held in custody ; and it was ordered that the newconsuls, Publius Cornelius Arvina and Quintus Mar-cius Tremulus, who by this time had been elected,should lay that affair intire before the senate [A.U.C.447. B.C. 305] : this gave such offence to the Hernici-ans that, at a meeting of all the states, assembled bythe Anagnians in the circus called the Maritime, thewhole nation of the Hernicians, excepting the Alatri-ans, Ferentines, and Verulans, declared war againstthe Roman people.
43. In Samnium also, in consequence of the depar­ture of Fabius, new commotions arose.

While searching narrowly every part of it,without finding any prize to compensate for the loss oftime, they let the enemy slip out of their hands.

Just as He was going out to the fieldbe happened to receive intelligence fronj a deserterthat twenty cohorts of Samaites, consisting of aboutfour hundred each, had marched towards dominium.Lest his colleague should be ignorant of this, he in­stantly despatched a messenger to him, and then or­dered the troops to advance with speed, having alreadyassigned to each division of the army its proper post,and appointed general officers to command them. TheCommand of the right wing he gave to Lucius Volum-nius, that of the left to Lucius Scipio, that of the ca­valry to the other lieuteaants-general, Caius Caediciusand Caius Trebonius. He ordered Spurius Nautius totake off the panniers from, the mules, and to lead themround quickly, together with his auxiliary cohorts, toa. rising ground in view, and there to show himselfduring the heat of the engagement, and to raise as muchdust as possible. While the general was employed inmaking these dispositions a dispute arose among thekeepers of the chickens about the auspices of the day,which was overheard by some Roman horsemen, who,deeming it a matter too important to be slighted, in­formed Spurius Papirius, the consul's nephew, thatthere was a doubt about the auspices. The youth bornin an age when that sort of learning which inculcatescontempt of the gods was yet unknown, examined intothe affair, that he might not carry an uncertain reportto the consul; and then acquainted him with it. Hiaanswer was, ' I very much applaud your conduct andzeal. However, the person who officiates in taking theauspices, if he makes a false report, draws on his ownhead the evil portended; but to the Roman people andtheir army the favorable omen reported to me is anexcellent auspice.'- He then commanded the centurionsto place the keepers of the chickens in the front of theline.

the affair was really a tumult, rather than a war. TheCarthaginians, another kind of foe, were crossing theIberus ; trained to arms during twenty-three years, inthe most laborious service, among the nations of Spain ;accustomed to conquer on every occasion ; habituatedto the command of a most able general; flushed withtheir late conquest of a very opulent city, and bringingwith them many Spanish states; while the Gauls, everglad of an opportunity of fighting, would doubtless beengaged in the expedition. War must then be wagedagainst all the world, in the heart of Italy, and underthe walls of Rome.

Spainfell to Cornelius; Africa, with Sicily, to Sempronius.For the service of the year six legions were decreed,with such a number of the troops of the allies as theconsuls should deem requisite, and a fleet as great ascould be fitted out. Of Romans were enlisted twenty-four thousand foot, and one thousand eight hundredhorse; of the allies, forty thousand foot, and four thou­sand four hundred horse. The fleet consisted of two hun­dred and twenty ships of five banks of oars, and twentylight galleys. The question was then proposed to thepeople, whether ' they chose and ordered that warshould be declared against the people of Carthage VThis being determined on, a general supplication wasperformed in the city, and prayers offered to the gods,that the war which the Roman people had orderedmight have a prosperous and a happy issue.

chose Lucius Cornelius Scipio and Cneius Fulvius.In the beginning of this year ambassadors came fromthe Lucanians to the new consuls, with complaints that' the Samnites, finding that they could not, by anyoffers, tempt them to take part in the war, had marchedan army in a hostile manner into their country, whichthey were now laying waste ; intending, by these vio­lent measures, to force them into a compliance. Theydeclared that the nation of the Lucanians thought theirformer errors too many, and were so firmly fixed intheir resolution, that they would rather undergo everykind of suffering and hardship than ever again violatethe reverence due to the Roman name: besought thesenate to take the people of Lucania into their protec­tion, and defend them from the injustice and outrageof the Samnites; and that, on their part, though theundertaking a war with the Samnites imposed on thema necessity of being faithful to the Romans, they werenevertheless willing to give hostages.'
12. The deliberation of the senate was short. Theyall, to a man, concurred in opinion that a compactshould be entered into with the Lucanians, and satis­faction demanded from the Samnites: accordingly, afavorable answer was returned to the Lucanians, andthe alliance concluded. Heralds were then sent to re­quire of the Samnites that they should depart from thecountry of the allies, and withdraw their troops fromthe Lucanian territory. These were met by personsdespatched for the purpose by the Samnites, who gavethem warning, that ' if they appeared at any assemblyin Samnium they must not expect to depart in safety.'As soon as this was heard at Rome the senate voted,and the people ordered, that war should be declaredagainst the Samnites. The consuls then, dividing theprovinces between them, Etruria fell to Scipio, theSamnites to Fulvius; and they set out by differentroutes, each against the enemy allotted to him.

Immedi­ately after this battle Hannibal removed into Liguria ;Sempronius to Luca. On Hannibal's arrival amongthe Ligurians, that people, in order to convince him oftheir sincerity in the treaty of peace and alliance whichthey had concluded, delivered into his bands two Ro­man questors, Caius Fulvius and Lucius Lucretius,with two military tribunes, and five persons of eques­trian rank, mostly the sons of senators; all of whomthey had seized in a treacherous manner.
60. While these transactions passed in Italy, CneiusCornelius Scipio, who was sent with the fleet and armyinto Spain, after his departure from the mouth of theRhone, sailing round the Pyrenean mountains, put intoEmporiae, where he disembarked his army; and begin­ning with the Lacetans, partly by renewing old treaties,partly by forming new ones, he brought under the do­minion of the Romans the whole coast, as far as theriver Iberus. The reputation of clemency which heacquired by these means had the most powerful effect,not only on the maritime states, but on the more bar­barous nations in the interior and mountainous parts;insomuch that, besides agreeing to terms of peace, theyconcluded also an alliance with him, and several strongcohorts of auxiliaries were raised among them. Thecountry on this side the Iberus was the province ofHanno, whom Hannibal had left behind for the defenceof that tract. Seeing, therefore, a necessity, before thewhole country should join the enemy, of exerting him­self to obviate that evil, he encamped his forces withinsightxif them, and offered them battle: this offer theRoman did not hesitate to accept; for, knowing thathe must fight Hanno and Hasdrubal, he was betterpleased to engage each of them separately than tohave to deal with both together.

But as the generals were not presentwhen the attacks were made, there were no bounds tothe carnage which ensued; and the nation of the Au-sonians, when there was scarcely any clear proof ofthe charge of its having revolted, was utterly de­stroyed, as if it had supported a contest through adeadly war.
26. During this year Luceria fell into the hands ofthe Samnites, the Roman garrison being betrayed tothem. The actors in this treachery did not long gounpunished : the Roman army was not far off, bywhom the city, which lay in a plain, was taken at thefirst onset. The Lucerians and Samnites were to aman put to the sword ; and to such a length was re­sentment carried, that at Rome, on the senate beingconsulted about sending a colony to Luceria, manyvoted for the demolition of it. Their hatred was ofthe bitterest kind, against a people whom they hadbeen obliged twice to subdue by arms ; the great dis­tance also made them averse from sending their citi­zens as colonists among nations so ill affected towardsthem. However, the resolution was carried that suchshould be sent; and accordingly two thousand fivehundred were transported thither. This year, disaffec--tion to the Romans becoming general, conspiracieswere formed among the leading men at Capua, as wellas at other places ; which being reported to the senate,they deemed it an affair by no means to be neglected.They decreed that inquiries should be made, and re­solved that a dictator should be appointed to enforcethese inquiries. Caius Maenius was accordingly no­minated, and he appointed Marcus Foslius master ofthe horse. People's dread of that office was verygreat, insomuch that the Calavii, Ovius, and Novius,who were the heads of the conspiracy, either throughfear of the dictator's power, or the consciousness ofguilt, previous to the charge against them being laidin form before him, chose, as appeared beyond doubt,to avoid trial by a voluntary death.

shall relate the matter as it has been handed down tous. While the principal persons of the state died bydisorders of the same kind, and which were attendedwith the same issue in every case, a certain maid ser­vant undertook, before Quintus Fabius Maximus, cu-rule edile, to discover the cause of the general malady,provided security were given ber, on the public faith,that she should not be a sufferer in consequence. Fa­bius immediately reported the affair to the consuls, andthe consuls to the senate ; and, by order of that body,the public faith was pledged to the informer. Shethen stated to them that the calamity which afflictedthe nation was caused by the wicked contrivances ofcertain women ; that some matrons were, at the time,preparing drugs for the purpose; and that, if theywould be pleased to go along with her without delay,they might detect them in the fact. Accordingly theyfollowed the informant, and found several women pre­paring drugs, and also quantities of the same laid up;which being brought into the forum, and the matronsin whose custody they were found, to the number oftwenty, being summoned by a beadle, two of them,Cornelia and Sergia, both of patrician families, assertedthat those drugs were wholesome ; while the informantmaintained the contrary, and insisted on their drinkingthem, in order to convict her of having invented afalsehood. On this, having taken time to confer toge­ther, and in the open view of all, a space being clearedfor them, they drank off the preparation, and all pe­rished by means of their own wicked device. Theirattendants, being instantly seized, gave informationagainst a great number of matrons, of whom no lessthan one hundred and seventy were condemned. Untilthat day no person had ever been tried at Rome forpoisoning. The affair was deemed a prodigy, andseemed more the result of madness than of vicious de­pravity.

In the middle, between the camps, ran a rivulet,whose banks were uncommonly steep; the adjacentground was covered with such herbs as grew in marshes,with bushes and brambles, which usually overspreaduncultivated ground. On examining the place him­self, and finding it to be capable of concealing evenhorsemen, he said to Mago his brother, ' This is thespot which you must occupy. Choose out from thewhole number of horse and foot a hundred men ofeach, and come with them to me at the first watch. Itis now time to take refreshment.' Thus the attendingofficers were dismissed. In some little time Magocame with his chosen band, and Hannibal said, ' I seeyou are very able men; but that you may be strong,not only in spirit but in number, let each of you choosenine like yourselves out of the troops and companies :Mago will show you the place where you are to lie inwait. You will have to deal with an enemy who isblind with respect to these stratagems of war.' Hav­ing thus sent off this detachment of one thousand horseand one thousand foot under Mago, Hannibal orderedthe Numidian cavalry to cross the river Trebia at thefirst light; to ride up to the enemy's gates, and, dig-charging their weapons against their men on guard, todraw them out to battle ; and then, as soon as the fightshould be commenced, to retreat leisurely, and by thatmeans draw them on to the other side of the river.These were his orders to the Numidians. To the otherofficers, both of cavalry and infantry, he gave direc-' tions to cause their men to take refreshment; and then,under arms, and with their horses accoutred, to waitthe signal.

the ambassadors of the Romans replied,' that they wouldgo, not whither their enemy called, but whither theircommanders should lead.' In the mean time, Publi-lius, by seizing an advantageous post between Palaepo-lis and Nea'polis, had cut off the confederates from thatinterchange of mutual aid, which they had hitherto af­forded each other, when either place was pressed. Theday of the elections approached ; and, as it was highlyinexpedient that Publilius should be recalled, when onthe point of assailing the enemy's walls, and in dailyexpectation of gaining possession of their city, appli­cation was made to the tribunes, to recommend to thepeople the passing of an order, that Publilius Philo,when his year of office should expire, might continuein command as proconsul until the war with the Greeksshould be finished. A letter was despatched to LuciusCornelius, with orders to name a dictator; for it wasnot thought proper that the consul should be recalledwhile he was employed in vigorously prosecuting thebusiness of the campaign, and had already carried thewar into Samnium. He nominated Marcus ClaudiusMarcellus, who appointed Spurius Postumius masterof the horse. The elections, however, were not heldby the dictator, because the regularity of his appoint­ment was called in question ; and the augurs beingconsulted, pronounced that it appeared defective.

The colonies of Suessa and Pontiewere established in this year. Suessa had been theproperty of the Auruncians: the Volscians had occu­pied Pontics, an island lying within sight of their shore.A decree of the senate was also passed for conductingcolonies to Interamna and Cassinum. [A. U. C. 442.B. C. 310.] But the commissioners were appointed,and the colonists, to the number of four thousand, sentby the succeeding consuls, Marcus Valerius and Pub-lius Decius.
29. The Samnites were now nearly disabled fromcontinuing the war; but, before the Roman senate wasfreed from all concern on that side, a report arose ofthe Etrurians intending to commence hostilities; andthere was not in those times any nation, excepting theGauls, whose arms were more dreaded, by reason bothof the vicinity of their country, and of the multitudeof their men. While therefore one of the consuls pro­secuted the remains of the war in Samnium, PubliusDecius, who, being attacked by a severe illness, re­mained at Rome, by direction of the senate, nominatedCains Junius Bubulcus dictator. He, as the magni­tude of the affair demanded, compelled all the youngercitizens to enlist, and with the utmost diligence pre­pared all requisite matters. Yet he was not so elatedby the power he had collected, as to think of com­mencing offensive operations, but prudently determinedto remain quiet, unless the Etrurians should becomeaggressors. The plans of the Etrurians were exactlysimilar with respect to preparing for, and abstainingfrom, war: neither party went beyond their own fron­tiers.

proved in the end victorious, was at times brought thenearest to the brink of ruin. Besides, they exerted inthe dispute almost a greater degree of rancor than ofstrength, the Romans being fired with indignation ata vanquished people presuming to take up armsagainst their conquerors; the Carthaginians, at thehaughtiness and avarice which they thought the othersshowed in their imperious exercise of the superioritywhich they had acquired. We are told that whenHamilcar was about to march at the head of an armyinto Spain, after the conclusion of the war in Africa,and was offering sacrifices on the occasion, his sonHannibal, then about nine years of age, solicited himwith boyish fondness to take him with him, whereonhe brought him up to the altars, and compelled him tolay his hand on the consecrated victims, and swearthat, as soon as it should be in his power, he wouldshow himself an enemy to the Roman people. Beinga man of high spirit, he was deeply chagrined at theloss of Sicily and Sardinia; for he considered Sicilyas given up by his countrymen through too hasty de­spair of their affairs, and Sardinia as fraudulentlysnatched out of their hands by the Romans during thecommotions in Africa, with the additional insult of afarther tribute imposed on them.
2. His mind was filled with these vexatious reflec­tions ; and during the five years that he was employedin Africa, which followed soon after the late pacifica­tion with Rome, and likewise during nine yearswhich he spent in extending the Carthaginian empirein Spain ; his conduct was such as afforded a demon­stration that he meditated a more important war thanany in which he was then engaged ; and that, if he hadlived some time longer, the Carthaginians would havecarried their arms into Italy under the command ofHamilcar, instead of under that of Hannibal. Thedeath of Hamilcar, which happened most seasonablyfor Rome, and the unripe age of Hannibal, occasionedthe delay.

Here, whilethe troops were preparing for an assault, a prospectoffered of the town being betrayed to them, and accord­ingly the commander of the garrison, one Dasius, aBrundusian, for a bribe of no great amount, only fourhundred pieces of gold,1 surrendered Clastidium toHannibal. This served the Carthaginians as a granarywhile they lay encamped on the Trebia. The prisoners,who fell into his hands on the surrender of the garrison,he treated without severity, being desirous that, at thecommencement of his proceedings, a good opinionshould be conceived of his clemency.
49. While the operations of the land forces on theTrebia were at a stand, much was effected by land andsea in and round Sicily, and the other islands adjacentto Italy, both by Sempronius the consul, and before hisarrival. Of twenty quinqueremes, sent by the Cartha­ginians with one thousand soldiers, to ravage the toastof Italy, nine arrived at Liparae, eight at the island ofVulcan, and three were driven by the current into thestrait. As soon as these were seen from Messanatwelve ships were despatched by Hiero, king of Syra­cuse, who happened to be then in that city waiting forthe Roman consul, and these took them without oppo­sition, and brought them into port to Messana. Fromthe prisoners it was discovered that, besides the fleetof twenty ships to which they belonged, and which hadbeen sent against Italy, another of thirty-five quinque­remes was on its way to Sicily, to rouse their ancient

The consuls, therefore, after de­spatching letters to the senate and people of Rome,containing accounts of the services which they hadperformed, led away their legions to different quarters,Papirius going to attack. Sepinnm, Carvilius to Vo-lana.
45. The letters of the consuls were heard with ex­traordinary exultation, both in the senate-house andin the assembly of the people ; and, in a public thanks­giving of four days' continuance, individuals concurredwith hearty zeal in celebrating the public rejoicings.These successes were not only important in themselves,but peculiarly seasonable ; for it happened that at thesame time intelligence was brought of the Etruriansbeing again in arms. The reflection naturally occurred,how it would have been possible, in case any misfor­tune had happened in Samnium, to have withstood thepower of Etruria ; which being encouraged by the con­spiracy of the Samnites, and seeing both the consuls,and the whole force of the Romans, employed againstthem, had made use of that juncture, in which the Ro­mans had so much business on their hands, for revivinghostilities. Ambassadors from the allies being intro­duced to the senate by the pretor Marcus Atilius, com­plained that their countries were wasted with fire andsword by the neighboring Etrurians, because they hadrefused to revolt from the Romans ; and they besoughtthe conscript fathers to protect them from the violenceand injustice of their common enemy. The ambassa­dors were answered, that ' the senate would take carethat the allies should not repent their fidelity:' that' the Etrurians should shortly be in the same situationwith the Samnites.' Notwithstanding which, the bu­siness respecting Etruria would have been prosecutedwith less vigor had not information been received that

But, if a judgmentis to be formed of him from the tenor of his conduct,in the new state of his fortune, and from the new dis­position, as I may say, which he put on after his suc­cesses, he would have entered Italy more like Dariusthan Alexander; and would have brought thither anarmy who had forgotten Macedonia, and were degene­rating into the manners of the Persians. It is painfulin speaking of so great a king to recite his ostentatiouspride in the frequent changes of his dress; his re­quiring that people should address him with adulation,prostrating themselves on the ground; a practice in­supportable to the Macedonians had they even beenconquered, much more so when they were victorious ;the shocking cruelty of his punishments ; his murder­ing his friends in the midst of feasting and wine ; withthe folly' of his fiction respecting his birth. Whatmust have been the consequence, if his love of winehad daily increased ? If his fierce and uncontrollableanger ? and as I mention not any one circumstance ofwhich there is a doubt among writers, do we considerthese as no disparagements to the qualifications of acommander? But then, as is frequently repeated bythe silliest of the Greeks, who are fond of exalting thereputation, even of the Parthians, at the expense ofthe Roman name, it was to be apprehended that theRoman people would not have had resolution to facethe splendor of Alexander's name, who, however, inmy opinion, was not known to them even by commonfame; and while in Athens, a state reduced to weak­ness by the Macedonian arms, which at the very timesaw the ruins of Thebes smoking in its neighborhood,men had spirit enough to declaim with freedom againsthim, as is manifest from the copies of their speeches,which have been preserved ; is it to be supposed thatout of such a number of Roman chiefs no one wouldhave freely uttered bis sentiments?

cution of the war, being provoked at the Sidicinianshaving so often taken arms against them, either asprincipals or auxiliaries. They therefore exerted theirutmost endeavors to raise to the consulship, the fourthtime, Marcus Valerius Corvus, the greatest general ofthat age. [A. U. C. 420. B. C. 332.1 The colleaguejoined with him was Marcus Atilius Regulus; and, lestchance might frustrate their wishes, a request wasmade to the consuls that, without casting lots, thatprovince might be assigned to Corvus. Receiving thevictorious army from the former consuls, he marcheddirectly to Cales, where the war had its rise ; andhaving at the first onset routed the enemy, who weredisheartened by the recollection of the former engage­ment, he directed his operations against the town itself.Such was the ardor of the soldiers, that they wantedto proceed directly up to the walls with ladders, assert­ing that they would quickly scale them ; but that beinga hazardous attempt, Corvus chose to effect his purposeby the labor of his men rather than at the expense ofso much danger to them ; he therefore formed a ram­part, prepared machines, and advanced towers up tothe walls. But an opportunity which accidentally pre­sented itself prevented his having occasion to use them ;for Marcus Fabius, a Roman, who was prisoner there,having broken his chains, while his guards were inat­tentive on a festival day, by. fastening a rope to one ofthe battlements, let himself down among the Romanworks, and persuaded the general to make an assaulton the enemy, while, in consequence of feasting anddrinking, they were disqualified for action. And thusthe Ausonians, together with their city, were capturedwith as little difficulty as they had been defeated inthe field. The booty found there was immense; andthe legions, leaving a garrison at Cales, returned toRome.

The master of thehorse was ordered to attend on the day following;but, being assured by every one that Papirius, beingagitated and exasperated in the course'of the presentcontention, would proceed against him with greaterviolence, he fled privately from the camp to Rome :where, by the advice of his father, Marcus Fabius,who bad been three times consul, and likewise dic­tator, be immediately called a meeting of the senate.While he was laying his complaints before the fathers,of the rage and injustice of the dictator, on a suddenwas heard the noise of lictors before the senate-houseclearing the way, and Papirius himself arrived full ofresentment, having followed with a guard of lighthorse as soon as he heard that the other had quittedthe camp.

Solemn rites wereperformed at this altar under the same regulationsnearly with those at the more ancient one; no personbeing allowed the privilege of taking part in the sacri­fices, except a woman of approved chastity, and whowas the wife of one husband. This institution, beingafterwards debased by the admission of vicious cha­racters, and not only by matrons, but women of everydescription, sunk at last into oblivion. During thisyear the Ogulnii, Cneius and Quintus, being curuleediles, carried on prosecutions against several usurers ;and these being condemned to pay fines out of the pro­duce and for the use of the public, the ediles madebrazen thresholds in the capitol; utensils of plate forthree tables, which were deposited in the chapel ofJupiter ; a statue of Jupiter in a chariot drawn by fourhorses placed on the roof; and images of the foundersof the city, in their infant state under the teats of thewolf, at the Ruminal fig-tree.

When the pretors arrived in Rome they hadaudience of the senate in the capitol; and the consul,Titus Manlius, having, by the direction of the senate,required of them that they should not make war on theSamnites, the confederates of the Romans,—Annius, asif he were a conqueror, who had taken the eapitol byarms, and not an ambassador, who owed his safety inspeaking to the law of nations, replied thus: ' TitusManlius, and you, conscript fathers, it is full time foryom to cease to treat us as a people Subject to yourcommands, since you see the very florishing statewhich, through the bounty of the gods, Latium enjoysat present, both with respect to numbers and strength :the Samnites are conquered by our arms ; the Sidi-cinians and Campanians, and now the Volscians also,are united to us in alliance ; and even your own colo­nies prefer the government of Latium to that of Rome.Bat since you do not think proper to put an end toyour imperious exertions of arbitrary dominion, we,although able by force of arms to assert the inde­

of the Samnites, and if they refused obedience, compelthem to it by arms.' To this the Romans gave an inde­terminate answer, because it would have been mortify­ing to acknowlege that the Latines were not under theirpower, and they feared lest, by charging them withmisbehavior they might attempt to free themselves fromall subjection ; but considered the case of the Campa-nians as very different, they having come under theirprotection, not by treaty, but-by surrender. Theyanswered, therefore, that ' the Campanians, whetherwilling or not, should be quiet; but, in the treaty withthe Latines, there was no article which prohibited theirwaging war against whom they chose.'
3. This answer, as it sent away the Samnites in doubtwhat opinion to form with respect to the conduct whichthe Romans intended to pursue, intirely subverted theallegiance of the Campanians by the menaces held outto them ; it also increased the presumption of the La­tines, as the senate seemed now not disposed, in anyrespect, to control them. These last, therefore, underthe pretext of preparing for war against the Samnites,held frequent meetings, in which their chiefs, concert­ing matters among themselves, secretly fomented thedesign of a war with Rome. The Campanians too gavetheir support to this war, though against their pre­servers. But, notwithstanding that they took all pos­sible pains to keep their proceedings from being gene­rally known, and though they wished to get rid of theVolscian enemy then at their back before the Romansshould be alarmed, yet by means of persons connectedwith the latter in hospitality and other private ties, in­telligence of the conspiracy was conveyed to Rome.There, the consuls being commanded to abdicate theiroffice, in order that the new ones might be the soonerelected, and have the more time to prepare for a warof so great importance, it began to be considered asimproper that the election should be held by personsnot vested with full authority'; consequently an inter­regnum took place, and continued under two inter-reges, Marcus Valerius and Marcus Fabius.

7. While the Romans were employed in these deli­berations and preparatory measures, the siege of Sa-guntum was prosecuted with the utmost vigor. Thiscity, by far the most wealthy of any beyond the Iberus,stood at the distance of about a mile from the sea: theinhabitants are said to have come originally from theisland Zacynthus, and to have been joined by some ofthe Rutulian race from Ardea. They had grown up,in a very short time, to this high degree of opulence,by means of a profitable commerce, both by sea andland, aided by the increase of their numbers, and theirreligious observance of compacts, which they carriedso far as to maintain the faith of all engagements in­violate, even should they tend to their own destruction.Hannibal marched into their territory in a hostile man­ner, and, after laying all the country waste, attackedtheir city on three different sides. There was an angleof the wall, which stretched down into a vale, morelevel and open than the rest of the ground round theplace: against this he resolved to carry on his ap­proaches, by means of which the battering-ram mightbe advanced up to the walls. But although the groundat some distance was commodious enough for the ma­nagement of his machines, yet, when the works cameto be applied to the purpose intended, it was found tobe no way favorable to the design ; for it was over­looked by a very large tower; and, as in that partdanger was apprehended, the wall had been raised to aheight beyond that-of the rest. Besides, as the great­est share of fatigue and danger was expected there, itwas defended with the greater vigor by a band ofchosen young men. These, at first with missile wea­pons, kept the enemy at a distance, nor suffered themto carry on any of their works in safety. In a littletime they not only annoyed them from the tower andthe walls, but had the courage to sally out on theworks and posts of the enemy; in which tumultuaryengagements the Saguntines generally suffered not agreater loss of men than the Carthaginians.

B.C. 337.] The latter elected consuls, Titus Man-lius Torquatus a third time, and Publius Decius Mus.It is agreed on all hands that, in this year, Alexander,king of Epirus, made a descent with a fleet on Italy, inwhich expedition, had his first attempts been crownedwith success, he would, without doubt, have carried hisarms against the Romans. This period was also dis­tinguished by the exploits of Alexander the Great, son'to the other's sister, who, in another quarter of theglobe, after showing himself invincible in war, wasdoomed by fortune to be cut off by sickness in theprime of life. Now the Romans, although they enter-,tained not a doubt of the revolt of their allies, and ofthe Latine nation, yet, as if they acted in behalf of the.Samnites, not of themselves, summoned ten of thechiefs of the Latines to appear at Rome, and receivetheir orders. The Latines had at that time two pre-tors, Lucius Annius, a native of Setia, and Lucius Nu-micius, of Circei, both Roman colonists ; through whosemeans, besides Signia and Velitra:, which belonged tothe Romans, the Yolscians also had been engaged tojoin in the war. It was thought proper that these twoshould be particularly summoned; every one clearlyperceived on what account they were sent for: the pre-tors, therefore, before they set out for Rome, called ageneral assembly, whom they informed that they werecalled to attend the Roman senate, and desired theiropinion with respect to the business which they sup­posed would be the subject of discussion, and to makeknown to them the answers which they chose shouldbe given on the occasion.

After several different opinions had been advancedAnnius said, ' Although I myself proposed the question,of what answer should be made, yet, in my judgment,the general interest requires that you determine howwe are to act, rather than how we are to speak.

While they were fighting, such were thesensations excited in the breasts, not only of theircomrades, but of the spectators in general, that the fateof those who died bravely was deemed not less happythan that of the successful combatants.
43. The minds of his men being thus affected by thesight of several pairs of combatants, he dismissed theremainder; and then, summoning an assembly, ad­dressed them, it is said, in the following manner: ' If,soldiers, you form a judgment of your own circum­stances, on the same principles which actuated youjust now, on the exhibition of a case wherein otherswere concerned, we are conquerors : for that spec­tacle was not intended as a gratification to you, but apicture in some sort of your own situation. Indeed,I know not whether fortune has not imposed on youstill stronger bonds, and a more powerful necessityfor usipg arms than on your prisoners. You are in­closed, on the right and left, by two seas, without somuch as even a single ship to' aid an escape : hemmedin on the front by the Po, a river larger and more vio­lent than the Rhone; and behind by the Alps, which,in your full strength and vigor, you passed not withoutthe utmost difficulty. Here, soldiers, where you havefirst met the enemy, you must conquer or die: and thesame fortune which compels you to fight holds out toyou prizes of victory, greater than which men seldomwish for at the hands of the immortal gods.

Such was the first battle with Hannibal, in whichit manifestly appeared that the Carthaginian was supe­rior in cavalry; and, consequently, that open plains,such as those between the Po and the Alps, were un­favorable to the Romans in their operations. Where­fore the consul, on the night following, ordering hismen to prepare in silence for a march, decamped fromthe Ticinus, and hastened to the Po, in order that, be­fore the rafts sl1ould be loosened, of which he hadformed the bridge over that river, he might carry overhis forces without tumult or interruption from theenemy's pursuit. They got as far as Placentia beforeHannibal received any certain information of their de­parture from the Ticinus. Nevertheless, he made pri­soners six hundred men, who delayed on the hitherbank, spending too much time in unbinding the raft.He could not pass over the bridge, because, as soon asthe extremities were untied, the whole collection ofrafts floated down with the current. Coelius relatesthat Magcwith the cavalry and the Spanish infantry,immediately swam over the river, and that Hannibalhimself led over the rest of the army, through fordssomewhat higher up, forming the elephants in a lineabove them, to break the force of the current. Theseaccounts can hardly gain credit with people ac­quainted with the river Po j for it is not credible thatthe cavalry could stem such a violent current withoutlosing their arms and horses, even allowing that all theSpaniards were conveyed over on leathern bags in­flated ; besides, that it would have cost a circuit ofmany days' march to find fords in the Po, throughwhich an army, heavily incumbered with baggage,could make a passage. Those authors seem to me moreworthy of credit who relate that, with difficulty, aftertwo days' search, a place was found where a bridge ofrafts could be constructed ; and that over this the ca­valry and light-armed Spaniards were sent forwardsunder Mago.

But he did, and ever shouldconsider the universal approbation, and will of thspeople, as equivalent to any order whatsoever.' Ac­cordingly, on the day following, being supported bythree plebeian tribunes in opposition to the protest ofthe other seven and the declared judgment of thesenate, he triumphed ; and the people paid every ho­nor to the day. In the historical accounts which havebeen transmitted to us of this year, there is some con­fusion ; Claudius asserts, that Postumius, after havingtaken several cities in Samnium, was defeated and putto flight in Apulia; and that being wounded himself,he was obliged to take refuge with a few attendants inLuceria. That the war in Etruria was conducted byAllius, and that it was he who triumphed. Fabiuswrites, that the two consuls acted in conjunction, bothin Samnium and at Luceria; that an army was ledover into Etruria, but by which of the consuls, he hasnot mentioned ; that at Luceria, great numbers wereslain on both sides : and that in that battle, the templeof Jupiter Stator was vowed, the same vow havingbeen formerly made by Romulus, but the fane only,that is the area appropriated for the temple, had beenyet consecrated. However in this year the state hav­ing been twice bound by the same vow, the senate, toavoid the guilt of neglect in the case of a religious ob­ligation, ordered the fane to be erected.

We find like­wise a war of the utmost importance, and a victory ofsuch consequence, as no man, excepting Lucius Papi­rius, the consul's father, had ever before obtained overthe Samnites.

19. It remains to compare the forces together, withrespect to their numbers, the different kinds of troops,and their resources for procuring auxiliaries. Now, inthe general surveys of that age, there were rated twohundred and fifty thousand men : so that, on everyrevolt of the Latine confederates, ten legions were en­listed almost intirely in the city. It often happenedduring those years that four or five armies were em­ployed at a time, in Etruria, in TJmbria, the Gaulsalso being at war, in Samnium, in Lucania. Then asto all Latium, with the Sabines and Volscians, the^Equans, and all Campania ; half of Umbria, Etruria,and the Picentians, the Marsians, Pelignians, Vesti-nians, and Apulians ; to whom we may add the wholecoast of the lower sea, possessed by the Greeks fromThurii, to Neapolis and Cum a;; and the Samnitesfrom thence as far as Antium and Ostia: all these hewould have found either powerful allies to the Ro­mans, or deprived of power by their arms. He wouldhave crossed the sea with his veteran Macedonians,amounting to no more than thirty thousand infantry,and four thousand horse, these mostly Thessalians.This was the whole of his strength. Had he broughtwith him Persians and Indians, and those other na­tions, it would be dragging after him an incumbrancerather than a support. Add to this, that the Romansbeing at home, would have had recruits at hand:Alexander, waging war in a foreign country, wouldhave found his army worn out with long service, ashappened afterwards to Hannibal.

(Volsinii, Perusia, and Arretium,) made overtures ofpeace; and having stipulated with the consul to fur­nish clothing and corn for his army, on condition ofbeing permitted to send deputies to Rome, they ob­tained a truce for forty years, and a fine was imposedon each state of five hundred thousand asses,1 to beimmediately paid. Postumius having demanded a tri­umph from the senate, in consideration of these ser­vices, rather in compliance with the general practice,than in hope of succeeding; and finding a strong oppo­sition made to his request; by one party, out of enmityto himself; by another, out of friendship to his col­league, whose disappointment they wished to consoleby a similar refusal: some objecting that he had beentoo dilatory in setting out from the city, others, thathe had removed from Samnium into Etruria withoutorders from the senate ; he addressed them thus:' Conscript fathers, I shall not carry my deference toyour high dignity to such a length, as to forget thatI am consul. The same authority of my office, bywhich I carried on those wars, shall now when thewars have been brought to a happy conclusion, Sam­nium and Etruria being subdued, and victory andpeace procured, give me the recompense of a triumph.'With these words, he left the senate. On this arose acontention between the plebeian tribunes ; some ofthem declaring that they would protest against hisassuming a triumph, in a method unprecedented;others, that they would support his pretensions in op­position to their colleagues. The affair came at lengthto be discussed before the people, and the consul beingsummoned to attend, he first represented that MarcusHoratius and Lucius Valerius, when consuls, and latelyCaius Marcus Rutilus, father of the present censor, hadtriumphed, not by direction of the senate, but by thatof the people ; and then added, that ' he would inlike manner have laid his request before the public,had he not known that some plebeian tribunes, the ab-

than guarded against any danger to himself or thepublic. ' But if they chose,' he said, ' to give him anassistant and associate in command, how could he over­look Publius Decius the consul, with whom he wasperfectly acquainted, as a colleague, on so many occa­sions ? There was no man living whom he would ra­ther wish to be joined in commission with him : withPublius Decius he should have forces sufficient, andnever too many enemies. If, however, his colleaguepreferred any other employment, let them then givehim Lucius Volumnius as an assistant.' The disposalof every particular was left intirely to Fabius by thepeople and the senate, and even by his colleague ;while Decius, having declared that he was ready to goeither to Etruria or Samnium, such general congratu­lation and satisfaction took place, that all men antici­pated victory, and felt as if a triumph, not a war, hadbeen decreed to the consuls. I find in some writersthat Fabius and Decius, immediately on their enteringinto office, set out together for Etruria; and no men­tion is made of the casting of lots, or of the disputeswhich I have related. Others, not satisfied with re­lating those disputes, have added charges of miscon­duct, laid by Appius before the people against Fabius,when absent; and a stubborn opposition, maintainedby the pretor against the consul, when present; andalso another contention between the colleagues, Deciusinsisting that each consul should attend to the care ofhis own separate province. Certainty, however, be­gins to appear from the time when both consuls set outfor the campaign. Now before these arrived in Etru­ria the Senonian Gauls came in a vast body to Clu-sium, to attack the Roman legion encamped there.Scipio, who commanded in that post, wishing to re­medy the deficiency of his numbers by an advantagein the ground, led his men up a hill, which stood be­tween the camp and the city: but having, in his haste,neglected to examine the place, when he came nearthe summit, he found it already,possessed by the ene­my, who had ascended on the" other side.

On the other side wereurged the inviolable authority of the Roman govern­ment and military discipline ; the edict of the dictator,always observed as the mandate of a deity ; nor wasthe severity of Manlius forgot, and his postponingeven parental affection to public utility. ' The samealso,' said the dictator, ' was the conduct of LuciusBrutus, the founder of Roman liberty, in the case ofhis two sons. But now, such is the indulgence of fa­thers, and the easiness of temper in the aged, that inthis case of contempt of the dictatorial authority theyindulge the young in the subversion of military order,as if it were a matter of trifling consequence. For hispart, however, he would persevere in his purpose, andwould not remit the smallest part of the punishmentjustly due to a person who fought contrary to hisorders, while the rites of religion were imperfectlyexecuted, and the auspices uncertain. Whether themajesty of the supreme authority was to be perpetual,or not, depended not on him ; but Lucius Papiriuswould not diminish aught of its rights. He wishedthat the tribunitian office, inviolate itself, would notby its interposition violate the authority of the Romangovernment; nor the Roman people, in his case par­ticularly, annihilate the dictator, and the rights of thedictatorship, together. But, if this should be thecase, not Lucius Papirius, but the tribunes and thepeople, would be blamed by posterity ; though thentoo late, when military discipline being once dis­solved, the soldier would no longer obey the ordersof the centurion, the centurion those of the tribune,the tribune those of the lieutenant-general, the lien-tenant-general those of the consul, nor the master ofthe horse those of the dictator.

In the annals of the magistrates and the re­cords we may run over whole pages of consuls anddictators, with whose bravery, and successes also, theRoman people never once had reason to he dissatisfied.And what renders them more deserving of admirationthan Alexander, or any king, is, that some of theseacted in the office of dictator, which lasted only ten, orit might be twenty days ; none in a charge of longerduration than the consulship of a year; their leviesobstructed by plebeian tribunes; often late in takingthe field ; recalled before the time to attend elections ;amidst the very busiest efforts of the campaign overtakenby the close of their official year: sometimes by therashness, sometimes the perverseness of a colleague,involved in difficulties or losses ; and finally succeed­ing to the unfortunate administration of a predecessor,with an army of raw or ill disciplined men. But,on the other hand, kings, being not only free fromevery kind of impediment, but masters of circum-stancesand seasons, control all things in subserviencyto their designs, themselves uncontrolled by any.

Nor was the victorygained without loss of blood ; for of the army of Pub-lius Decius, the killed amounted to seven thousand ;of the army of Fabius, to one thousand two hundred.Fabius, after sending persons to search for the body ofhis colleague, bad the spoils of the enemy collectedinto a heap, and burned them as an offering to Jupiterthe Victorious. The consul's body could not be foundthat day, being hid under a heap of slaughtered Gauls :on the following it was discovered and brought to theramp, amidst abundance of tears shed by the soldiers.Fabius, discarding all concern about any other busi­ness, solemnised the obsequies of his colleague in themost honorable manner, passing on him the high encoTmiums which be had justly merited.

During the same period, Cneius Fulvius, pro-pretor, made a progress in Etruria equal to his wishes ;having, besides the immense losses occasioned to theenemy by the devastation of their lands, fought abattle with extraordinary success, in which there wereabove three thousand of the Perusians and Clusiansslain, and twenty military standards taken. The Sam-nites in their flight passing through the Pelignian ter­ritory, were attacked on all sides by the Pelignians;and out of five thousand, one thousand were killed.The glory pf the day in the affair at Sentinum wasgreat, when represented with a strict adherence totruth : but some have carried their exaggerations of itbeyond the bounds of credibility, asserting in theirwritings that there were in the army of the enemyforty thousand three hundred and thirty foot, sixthousand horse, and one thousand chariots; that is, in­cluding the Etrurians and Umbrians, who they affirmwere present in the engagement; and to magnify like­wise the number of Roman forces, they add to theconsuls another general, Lucius Volumnius, proconsul,and his army to their legions.

This temptation not inducing anyone to stir from his station, one of the herdsmen, ad­vancing close to the works, called out that others weredriving out those cattle at their leisure from the ruinsof the town ; why did they remain idle, when theymight safely drive them through the middle of the Ro­man camp ? This being interpreted to the lieutenant-general by some natives of Csere, and great impatienceprevailing through every company of the soldiers,who, nevertheless, dared not to move without orders,he commanded some who were skilled in the languageto observe attentively whether the dialect of theherdsmen resembled that of rustics or of citizens:these reported that their accent in speaking, theirmanner and appearance, were all of a more polishedcast than suited such description of persons. ' Gothen,' said he, ' tell them that they may uncover theambush which they vainly conceal; that the Romansunderstand all their devices, and can now be no moretaken by stratagem than they can be conquered byarms.' When these words were heard, and carried tothose who lay in ambush, they immediately arose fromtheir lurking place, and marched out in order into theplain, which was open to view on every side. Thelieutenant-general, thinking their force too powerfulfor his small band to cope with, sent in haste to Vale­rius for support, and in the mean time, by himself,sustained the enemy's onset.

Besides this, the Etrurians having made a levy oftroops, enforced by the sanctions of the devoting law,each man choosing another, came to an engagement atthe Cape of Vadimon, with more numerous forces,and, at the same time, with greater spirit than theyhad ever shown before. The battle was fought withsuch animosity that no javelins were thrown by eitherparty: swords alone were made use of; and the furyof the combatants was still higher inflamed by the long-continued contest; so that it appeared to the Romansas if they were disputing, not with Etrurians, whomthey had so often conquered, but with a new race.Not the least intention of giving ground appeared inany part; the first lines fell; and, lest the standardsshould be exposed without defence, the second lineswere formed in their place. At length, even the lastreserves were called into action ; and such was the ex­tremity of the difficulty and danger, that the Romancavalry dismounted, and pressed forward, throughheaps of arms and bodies, to the front ranks of the in­fantry. A new army, as it were, thus starting up,disordered the battalions of the Etrurians; and therest, weak as their condition was, seconding this at­tack, broke at last through the enemy's ranks. Theirobstinacy then began to give way: some companiesquitted their posts, and, as soon as they once turnedtheir backs, betook themselves to open flight. Thatday first broke the strength of the Etrurians, nowgrown exuberant through a long course of prosperity;all the flower of their men were cut off, and the Ro­mans, without halting, seized and sacked their camp.

Equal danger, and an issue equally glorious,soon after attended the war with the Samnites; who,besides their many preparations for the field, made nolittle glitter with new decorations of their armor.

terred the other states from joining in alliance withRome. For thus the oldest member of their assembly-replied, ' Where is your sense of shame, Romans,when you require of us that we should prefer yourfriendship to that of the Carthaginians ? The Sagun-tines, who embraced it, have been abandoned by you :in which abandonment you, their allies, have showngreater cruelty than the Carthaginians, their enemy,showed in destroying them. What I recommend is,that you seek connexions where the fatal disaster ofSaguntum is unknown. To the states of Spain theruins of that city will be both a melancholy and forci­ble warning, not to confide in the faith or alliance ofRome.' They were then ordered to depart immedi­ately from the territories of the Volscians ; nor didthey afterwards meet from any assembly in Spain amore favorable reception ; therefore, after making acircuit through all parts of that country without effect­ing any thing, they passed over into Gaul.
20. At Ruscino they encountered a new and terrify­ing spectacle; the people coming in arms to the assem­bly, for such is the custom of that country. Afterdisplaying in magnificent terms the renown and thevalor of the Roman people, and the greatness of theirempire, they requested that the Gauls would not granta passage through their cities and territories to theCarthaginian, who was preparing to invade Italy. Onwhich, we are told, such a laugh was raised, accompa­nied by a general outcry of displeasure, that the ma­gistrates and the elder members of the assembly couldwith difficulty bring the younger men into order, sounreasonable and so absurd did it appear to requirethat the Gauls should not suffer the war to pass intoItaly, but should draw it on themselves, and exposetheir own lands to devastation, instead of those ofstrangers.

With respect to the other prodigies,the decemvirs were commanded to consult the books :but on account of the shower of stones in Picenum,the nine days' festival was ordered to be celebrated,and the expiating of the rest, one after another, wasalmost the sole occupation of the state. In the firstplace was performed a purification of the city; vic­tims of the greater kinds were offered to such gods aswere pointed out by directions. An offering of fortypounds' weight of gold was carried to the temple ofJuno at Lanuvium, and the matrons dedicated a bra­zen statue to Juno on the Aventine. A lectisterniuinwas ordered at Cajre, where the divining tickets haddiminished; also a supplication to Fortune at Algi-dum.

there Nerulum was surprised and stormed by the con­sul jEmilius. When fame trad spread abroad amongthe allies how firmly the affairs of Capua were settledby the introduction of the Roman institutions, the An-tians, imitating the example, presented a complaint oftheir being without laws and without magistrates; onwhich the patrons of the colony itself were appointedby the senate to form a body of laws for it. Thus notonly the arms, but the laws of Rome widely extendedtheir sway.
21. The consuls, Caius Junius Bubulcus and Quin-tus jEmilius Barbula, at the conclusion of the yeardelivered over the legions, not to the consuls electedby themselves, who were Spurius Nautius and Mar­cus Popillius, but to a dictator, Lucius /Emilius.[A.U.C. 438. B.C. 314.] He, with Lucius Fulvius,master of the horse, laying siege to Saticula, gave oc­casion to the Samnites of reviving hostilities, and thisproduced a twofold alarm to-the Roman army. Onone side, the Samnites having collected a numerousforce with intent to relieve their allies from the siege,pitched their camp at a small distance from that of theRomans: on the other side the Saticulans, openingsuddenly their gates, ran up with violent tumult totheir posts. Afterwards each party, relying on sup­port from the other more than on its own strength,formed a regular attack, and pressed on the Romans.The dictator, on his part, though obliged to opposetwo enemies at once, yet had his line secure on bothsides; for he chose a position in which he could noteasily be surrounded, and also formed two differentfronts. However, he directed his first efforts againstthose who bad sallied from the town, and, withoutmeeting much resistance, drove them back within thewalls. He then turned his whole force against theSamnites: there he found greater difficulty. But thevictory, though long delayed, was neither doubtful noralloyed by losses. The Samnites, being forced to flyinto their camp, extinguished their fires at night, andmarched away in silenoe ; and renouncing all hopes of

guntines forming with their bodies a bnlwark to theirnative city, instead of its wall, of which it had beenstripped ; not one of them giving ground, lest be shouldmake room for the enemy to enter by th'e space. Thegreater therefore the eagerness of the combatants, andthe closer their ranks, the more wounds consequentlywere received, no weapon falling without taking effecteither in their bodies or armor.
9. The Saguntines had a missile weapon called fa-larica, with a shaft of fir, round, except towards theend, to which the iron was fastened : this part, whichwas square, as in a javelin, they bound about with towand daubed with pitch : it had an iron bead three feetlong, so that it could pierce both armor and body toge­ther : but what rendered it most formidable was, thatbeing discharged with the middle part on fire, and themotion itself increasing greatly the violence of theflame, though it struck in the shield without penetra­ting to the body, it compelled the soldier to throwaway his arms, and left him without defence againstsucceeding blows. Thus the contest long continueddoubtful; and the Saguntines, finding that they suc­ceeded in their defence beyond expectation, assumednew courage ; while the Carthaginian, because he hadnot obtained the victory, deemed himself vanquished.On this the townsmen suddenly raised a shout, pushedback the enemy among the ruins of the wall, drovethem off from that ground, where they were embar­rassed and confused, and, in fine, compelled them tofly in disorder to their camp.
10. In the mean time an account was received thatambassadors had arrived from Rome; on which Han­nibal sent messengers to the sea-shore to meet them,and to acquaint them that it would not be safe for themto come to him through the armed bands of so manysavage nations; and besides, that in the present criticalstate of affairs, he had not leisure to listen to embassies.He saw clearly that on being refused audience, theywould proceed immediately to Carthage: he thereforedespatched messengers and letters beforehand to the

guntum was taken in the eighth month from the begin­ning of the siege ; that Hannibal then retired into win­ter-quarters to New Carthage; and that, in the fifthmonth, after leaving Carthage, he arrived again in Italy.But if these accounts were true, it is impossible thatPublius Cornelius and Tiberius Sempronius could havebeen the consuls, to whom, in the beginning of the siege,the ambassadors were sent from Saguntum; and who,during their office, fought with Hannibal; the one atthe river Tieinus, and both, a considerable time after,at the Trebia. Either all these matters must have beentransacted in less time, or Saguntum must have beentaken, not first invested, in the beginning of that yearwherein Publius Cornelius and Tiberius Semproniuswere consuls: for the battle at the Trebia could nothave happened so late as the year of Cn. Servilius andCaius Flaminius; because Caius Flaminius entered onthe office of consul at Ariminum, having been electedthereto by Tiberius Sempronius, who, after the engage­ment at the Trebia, had gone home to Rome for thepurpose of electing consuls; and when the election wasfinished, returned into winter-quarters to the army.
16. The ambassadors returning from Carthage,brought information to Rome that every thing tendedto war; and nearly at the same time news was re­ceived of the destruction of Saguntum. Grief seizedthe senate for the deplorable catastrophe of theirallies; and shame for not having afforded them suc­cor ; rage against the Carthaginians, and such appre­hensions for the public safety, as if the enemy werealready at their gates ; so that their minds being agi­tated by so many passions at once, their meetings werescenes of confusion and disorder, rather than of deli­beration: for ' never,' they observed, ' had an enemymore enterprising and warlike entered the field withthem ; and at no other period had the Roman powerbeen so unfit for great exertions, or so deficient inpractice.

public quarrel, but by their private emolument. Thusreduced, the Samnites sued to the dictator for peace;and after they had engaged to supply each of his sol­diers with a suit of clothes and a year's pay, beingordered to apply to the senate, they answered thatthey would follow the dictator, committing their causewholly to his integrity and honor. On this the troopswere withdrawn out of Samnium.
37. [A.U.C. 431. B.C. 321.] The dictator enteredthe city in triumph; and though desirous of resigninghis office immediately, yet, by order of the senate, heheld it until the consuls were elected: these were CaiusSulpicius Longus, a second time, and Quintus jEmiliusCerretanus. The Samnites, without finishing the treatyof peace, the terms being still in negotiation, departed,after concluding a truce for a year. Nor was even thatfaithfully observed, so strongly was their inclinationfor war excited on hearing that Papirius was gone outof office. In this consulate of Caius Sulpicius andQuintus jEmilius (some histories have Aulius), to therevolt of the Samnites was added a new war with theApulians. Armies were sent against both. The Sam­nites fell by lot to Sulpicius, the Apulians to iEmilius.Some writers say that this war was not waged with theApulians, but in defence of the allied states of that na­tion against the violence and injustice of the Samnites.But the circumstances of the Samnites at that period,when they were themselves engaged in a war, whichthey could with difficulty support, render it more pro­bable that they did not make war on the Apulians, butthat both nations were in arms against the Romans atthe same time. However, no memorable event oc­curred. The lands of the Apulians and Samnium wereutterly laid waste; but in neither quarter did theenemy show themselves. At Rome an alarm, whichhappened in the night, suddenly roused the peoplefrom their sleep in such a fright, that the capitol andcitadel, the walls and gates, were all filled with men inarms.

brought into inextricable difficulties ; hemmed in, notmore effectually by the arms of their enemy, than bythe disadvantage of the ground.' Their joy was evenmingled with a degree of envy, because Fortune, asthey thought, had transferred the glory of finishing theRoman war from the Samnites to the Etrurians: theyhastened therefore, with their whole collected force,to crush the consul Caius Marcius; resolving, if he didnot give them an opportunity of fighting, to proceedthrough the territories of the Marsians and Sabinesinto Etruria. The consul met them, and a battle wasfought with great fury on both sides, but without a de­cisive issue. Although both parties suffered severely,yet the discredit of losing the day fell on the Romans,because several of equestrian rank, some military tri­bunes, with one lieutenant-general, had fallen ; and,what was more remarkable than all, the consul himselfwas wounded. This event, exaggerated by report, asis usual, greatly alarmed the senate, so that they re­solved on having a dictator nominated. No one enter-rtained a doubt that the nomination would light on Pa-pirius Cursor, who was then universally deemed topossess the greatest abilities as a commander: but theycould not be certain, either that a message might beconveyed with safety into Samnium, where all was ina state of hostility, or that the consul Marcius wasalive. The other consul, Fabius, was at enmity withPapirius, on his own account; and lest this resentmentmight prove an obstacle to the public good, the senatevoted that deputies of consular rank should be sent tohim, who, uniting their own influence to that of go­vernment, might prevail on him to drop, for the sakeof his country, all remembrance of private animosities.When the deputies came to Fabius, and delivered tohim the decree of the senate, adding such argumentsas were suitable to their instructions, the consul, cast­ing his eyes towards the ground, retired in silence,leaving them in uncertainty what part he intended toact.

Then, having gained intelligence by meansof the same Gauls, (who differed not much from theothers in language or manners, and who had enteredinto conversation with them,) that the pass was blockedup only by day, and that at night they separated totheir several dwellings, he advanced at the first dawnto the eminences, as if with the design of forcing hisway through the pass. This feint he carried on throughthe whole day, his men at the same time fortifying acamp in the spot where they were drawn up. As soonas he understood that the mountaineers had retiredfrom the heights, and withdrawn their guards, hemade, for a show, a greater number of fires than wasproportioned to the troops who remained in the camp,and, leaving behind the baggage, with the cavalry andthe greatest part of the infantry, he himself, with alight-armed band, composed of the most daring men inthe army, pushed rapidly through the pass, and tookpost on those very eminences of which the enemy hadbeen in possession.

IJy this time themountaineers, on a signal given, were coming togetherout of their fortresses to their usual station ; when, ona sudden, they perceived a part of the enemy overtheir heads in possession of their own strong post, andthe rest passing along the road. Both these circum­stances striking them at once, they were for some timeincapable of thought, or of turning their eyes to anyother object. Afterwards, when they observed theconfusion in the pass, and that the body of the enemywas disordered on their march by the hurry amongthemselves, and particularly by the unruliness of theaffrighted horses, it was imagined that, to augment inany degree the terror under which they already la­bored, were effectually to destroy them: they there­fore ran down the rocks in an oblique direction through

Let neither theRoman people blame the convention of the consuls,nor us the faith of the Roman people. Will you neverwant an excuse for violating the compacts which youmake on being defeated ? You gave hostages to Por-sena: you clandestinely got them back.

Do the Roman peo­ple disapprove of their legions being saved by an igno­minious peace? Let them take back their peace, andreturn the captured legions to the conqueror. Thiswould be conduct consistent with faith, with treaties,and with the laws of the heralds. But that you should,in consequence of the convention, obtain what you de­sired, the safety of so many of your countrymen, whileI obtain not what I stipulated for on sending you backthose men, a peace; is this the law which you, AulusCornelius, which you, heralds, prescribe to nations?But for my part, I neither accept those men whom youpretend to surrender, nor consider them as surren­dered ; nor do I hinder them from returning into theirown country, which stands bound under an actual con­vention, carrying with them the wrath of all the gods,whose authority is thus despised.

14. The surrounding crowd, gradually approachingto hear this discourse, had formed an assembly of thepeople conjoined with the senate, when the men ofprincipal distinction, withdrawing suddenly before anyanswer was given, collected all the gold and silver bothfrom their private and public stores, into the forum,threw it into a fire hastily kindled for the purpose, andthen most of them cast themselves headlong in after it.While the dismay and confusion which this occasionedfilled every part of the city, another uproar was heardfrom the citadel. A tower, after being battered for along time, had fallen down, and a cohort of the Car­thaginians having forced their way through the breach,gave notice to their general that the place was destituteof the usual guards and watches. Hannibal, judgingthat such an opportunity admitted no delay, assaultedthe city with his whole force, and instantly makinghimself master of it, gave orders that every person ofadult age should be put to the sword : which cruelorder was proved, however, by the event, to have beenin a manner induced by the conduct of the people ; forhow could mercy have been extended to any of thosewho, shutting themselves up with their wives and chil­dren, burned their houses over their heads; or who,being in arms, continued fighting until stopped bydeath ?

In the town was found a vast quantity of spoil,notwithstanding that the greater part of the effects hadbeen purposely injured by the owners ; and that, duringthe carnage, the rage of the assailants had made hardlyany distinction of age, although the prisoners were theproperty of the soldiers. Nevertheless, it appears thata large sum of money was brought into the treasuryout of the price of goods exposed to sale, and likewisethat a great deal of valuable furniture and apparel wassent to Carthage.

of war was deemed suitable to the dignity of the Ro­man people, even before this time, but more particu­larly after the destruction of Saguntum, than to enterinto a verbal disquisition concerning the constructionof treaties: for if the business were to be decided byargument, what simil1tude was there between the treatyof Hasdrubal and the former treaty of Lutatius, whichwas altered ? Since in the latter there was an expressclause inserted, that ' it should be valid, provided thepeople should ratify itbut in that of Hasdrubal therewas no such provision. Besides, this treaty was con­firmed in such a manner by the silent approbation of somany years, during the remainder of his life, that evenafter the death of its author no alteration was made init; although, even were the former treaty adhered to,there was sufficient security provided for the Sagun-tines, by the exempting from hostilities the allies of bothnations, there being no distinction made of those whothen were, or of those who sjiould afterwards becomesuch. And, as it was evidently allowable to form newalliances, who could think it reasonable, either thatpersons should not be received into friendship on ac­count of any degree of merit whatever ; or, that peo­ple, once taken under protection, should not be de­fended ? The only restriction implied was, that theallies of the Carthaginians should not be solicited torevolt, nor, revolting of their own accord, should bereceived. The Roman ambassadors, in pursuance oftheir instructions received at Rome, passed over fromCarthage into Spain, in order to make application tothe several states of that country, and either to en­gage their alliance, or at least to dissuade them fromjoining the Carthaginians. They came, first to theBargusian, by whom being favorably received becausethat people were dissatisfied with the Carthaginiangovernment, they roused the spirits of many powerson the farther side of the Iberus by the flattering pros­pect of a change in their circumstances.

What employment will the two con­suls and their armies have in the mean time ?'

If at the lake of Re-gillus we gave you fighting until you were weary, I willanswer for it that we shall in this place also give yousuch entertainment, that, for the future, it will not beextremely agreeable, to you to face us in the field.'

Depend­ing on this, as a covering to the design, when the sunwas but just risen, and the light which he did affordwas obscured by the fog, the Samnites came up to anadvanced guard of the Romans at one of the gates,who were standing carelessly on their post. In thef udden surprise, these had neither courage nor strengthto make resistance : an assault was then made, throughthe Decuman gate, in the rear of the camp: the ques-tor's quarters in consequence fell into the hands of theenemy, and the questor, Lucius Opimius Pansa, wasthere slain, on which a general alarm was given.
33. The consul, being roused by the tumult, orderedtwo cohorts of the allies, a Lucanian and Suessanian,which happened to be nearest, to defend the head­quarters, and led the companies of the legions downthe principal street. These ran into the ranks, scarcelytaking time to furnish themselves with arms ; and, asthey distinguished the enemy by their shout ratherthan by sight, could form no judgment how great theirnumber might be : thus, ignorant of the circumstancesof their situation, they at first drew back, and sufferedthem to penetrate into the heart of the camp. Theconsul asking them aloud, whether they intended tolet themselves be beaten out beyond the rampart, andthen to return again to storm their own camp, theyraised the shout, and, uniting their efforts, stood theirground ; then made advances, pushed closely on theenemy, and, having forced them to give way, drovethem back, without suffering their first terror to abate.They soon beat them out beyond the gate and the ram­part, but not daring to pursue them, because the dark­ness of the weather made them apprehend an ambush,and content with having cleared the camp, they retiredwithin the rampart, having killed about three hundredof the enemy. Of the Romans, including the first ad­vanced guard and the watchmen, and those who weresurprised at the questor's quarters, two hundred andthirty perished.

Thence­forward the mountaineers made their attacks in smallerparties, more like robbers than an army; at one timeon the van, at another on the rear, just as the groundhappened to afford them an advantage, or as stragglersadvancing before the rest, or staying behind, gave theman opportunity. As the driving the elephants throughthe narrow roads, even with all the haste that could bemade, occasioned much loss of time, so wherever theywent they effectually secured the troops from the ene­my ; who, being unaccustomed to such creatures, darednot to come near them. On the ninth day the armycompleted the ascent to the summit of the Alps, mostlythrough pathless tracts and wrong roads; into whichthey had been led, either by the treachery of theirguides, or, when these were not trusted, rashly, onthe strength of their own conjectures, following thecourses of the valleys. On the summit they remainedencamped two days, in order to refresh the soldiers,who were spent with toil and fighting; and in this timeseveral of the beasts which had fallen among the rocks,following the tracts of the army, came into the camp.Tired as the troops were, of struggling so long withhardships, they found their terrors very much increasedby a fall of snow, this being the season of the settingof the constellation of the Pleiades.1 The troops wereput in motion with the first light; and as they marchedslowly over ground which was intirely covered withsnow, dejection and despair being strongly marked inevery face, Hannibal went forward before the stan­dards, and ordering the soldiers to halt on a projectingeminence, from which there was a wide extendedprospect, made them take a view of Italy, and of theplains about the Po, stretching along the foot of themountains; then told them that ' they were now scalingthe walls, not only of Italy, but of the city of Rome:

Camertian, and giving the command of the camp toLucius Scipio, as propretor, he returned to Rome, inorder to adjust measures for carrying on the war;either led thereto by his own judgment, on finding itattended with greater difficulty than he had believedfrom report, or being summoned by a decree of senate,for both accounts are given. Some choose to have itbelieved that he was forced to return by the practicesof the pretor, Appius Claudius; who, both in the se­nate and before the people, exaggerated, as he waswont in all his letters, the danger of the Etrurian war ;contending that ' one general, or one army, would notbe sufficient to oppose four nations: that whether thesedirected the whole of their combined force against himalone, or acted separately in different parts, there wasreason to fear that he would be unable to provide effec­tually against every emergency: that he had left therebut two Roman legions; and that the foot and horsewho came with Fabius did not amount to five thousand.It was therefore his opinion that the consul PubliusDecius should, without delay, join his colleague inEtruria; and that the province of Samnium should begiven to Lucius Volumnius. But, if the consul pre­ferred going to his own province, that then Volumniusshould march a full consular army into Etruria to jointhe other commander.' The advice of the pretor wasapproved by a great part of the members ; but PubliusDecius recommended that every thing should be keptundetermined and open for Quintus Fabius until heshould either come to Rome, if he could do so withoutprejudice to the public, or send some of his lieutenants,from whom the senate might learn the real state of thewar in Etruria; and what number of troops, and howmany generals, would be requisite for carrying it on.

Fabius, on his return to Rome qualified hisdiscourses, both in the senate and before the people,in such a manner as to appear neither to exaggerate orlessen any particular relating to the war; and to showthat, in agreeing to another general being joined withhim, he rather indulged the apprehensions of others

At first, an event so unexpected causedsome confusion, while they were taking their arms,and throwing the baggage into the centre; but, as fastas each had freed himself from his burden, and fittedhimself with arms, they assembled about the standardsfrom every side ; and all, from the long course of theirservice, knowing their particular ranks, they formedthe line without any directions. The consul, riding upto the place where the fight was most warm, leapedfrom his horse, and called ' Jupiter, Mars, and theother gods to witness, that he had come into that place,not in pursuit of any glory to himself, but of booty forhis soldiers ; nor could any other fault be charged onhim than too great a solicitude to enrich them at theexpense of the enemy. From the impending disgracenothing could extricate him but the valor of the troops:let them only join unanimously in a vigorous attackagainst a foe whom they had already vanquished inthe field, beaten out of their camps, and stripped oftheir towns, and who were now trying their last re­source, in arr attempt to overreach them, by the con­trivance of an ambuscade, placing their reliance on theground they occupied, not on their arms.

But assoon as the first battalions got footing in the plain, onthe summit, and the troops'perceived that they nowstood on equal ground, the dismay was instantly turnedon the plotters ; who, dispersing and casting away theirarms, attempted by flight to recover the same lurkingplaces in which they had lately concealed themselves.

Publilius had a triumph decreed him, because peoplewere well convinced that it was his conduct of thesiege which reduced the enemy to submission.

The Tarentines having for a consi­derable time buoyed up the state of Palaepolis withdelusive hopes of assistance, when they understoodthat the Romans had gotten possession of that city, asif they were the persons who had suffered the disap­pointment, and not the authors of it, they inveighedagainst the Palaepolitans, and became furious in theiranger and malicje towards the Romans; to which theywere farther incited by receiving information that theLucanians and Apulians had joined them ; for a treatyof alliance had been this year concluded with boththese nations. ' The business,' they observed, ' wasnow brought almost to their doors ; and such wonldsoon be the state of affairs, that they must deal withthe Romans as enemies, or receive them as masters :that, in fact, their interests were at stake on the issueof the war of the Samnites, the only nation which con­tinued to make opposition ; and that with power veryinadequate since they were deserted by the Lucanians ;these however might yet be brought back, and induced torenounce the Roman alliance, if proper skill were usedin sowing dissension between them.' These reasoningsbeing readily adopted by people who wished for achange, they procured, for money, some young Luca­nians of considerable note in their country, but devoidof honor, to bring about their design: these havinglacerated each other's bodies with stripes, came nakedinto a public meeting of their countrymen, exclaimingthat because they had ventured to go into the Romancamp, they had been thus beaten with rods by order ofthe consul, and had hardly escaped the loss of theirheads.

been the consequence, respecting the affairs of theRomans, if they had happened to have been engagedin a war with Alexander. The circumstances ofgreatest moment seem to be, the number and braveryof the soldiers, the abilities of the commanders, andfortune, which exerts a powerful sway over all hu­man concerns, and especially over those of war. Nowthese particulars, considered both separately and col­lectively, must clearly convince an observer that notonly other kings and nations, but that even Alexanderhimself, would have found the Roman empire invin­cible. And first, to begin with comparing the com­manders, I do not, indeed, deny that Alexander was acaptain of consummate merit; but still bis fame owespart of its lustre to his having been single in command,and to his dying young, while his affairs were advanc­ing in improvement, and while he had not yet expe­rienced a reverse of fortune : for, to pass by otherillustrious kings and leaders, who afford exemplary in­stances of the decline of human greatness, what was itbut length of life which subjected Cyrus, (whom theGreeks in their panegyrics exalt so far beyond allothers,) to the caprice of fortune? And the same waslately the case of Pompey the Great. I shall enume­rate the Roman chiefs: not every one of every age,but those only with whom, either as consuls or dicta­tors, Alexander might have been engaged. MarcusValerius Corvus, Caius Marcius Rntilus, Caius Sulpi-cius, Titus Manlius Torquatus, Quintns PubliliusPhilo, Lucius Papirius Cursor, Quintus Fabius Maxi-mus, the two Decji, Lucius Voluiunius, Manius Cu-rius. Then follow a number of very extraordinarymen, had it so happened that he had first engaged inwar with Carthage, and had come into Italy at a moreadvanced period of life.

part of the city which was possessed by the Samniles,which detachment was commanded by Lucius Quintius,military tribune.
26. In the mean time Nymphius, on his part, art­fully addressing himself to the commander of the Saro-nites, prevailed on him, as all the troops of the Ro­mans were employed either about Palaepolis, or inSamnhim, to allow him to sail round with the fleet tothe territory of Rome, where he undertook to ravagenot only the sea-coast, but the country adjoining the verycity. But in order to avoid observation, it was neces­sary, he told him, to set out by night, and to launchthe ships immediately. To effect this with the greaterdespatch, all the young Samnites, except the necessaryguards of the city, were sent to the shore. WhileNymphius wasted the time there givipg contradictoryorders, designedly to create confusion, which was in­creased by the darkness, and by the crowd, which wasso numerous as to obstruct each other's operations,Charilaus, according to the plan concerted, was ad­mitted by his associates into the city ; and having filledthe higher parts of it with Roman soldiers, he orderedthem to raise a shout; on which the Greeks, who hadreceived previous directions from their leaders, keptthemselves quiet. The Nolans fled through the oppo­site part of the town by the road leading to Nola. Theflight of the Samnites, who were shut out from thecity, was easier, but had a more disgraceful appear­ance ; for they returned to their homes without arms,stripped of their baggage, and destitute of every thing;all, in short, belonging to them being left with theirenemies ; so that they were objects of ridicule, notonly to foreigners, but even to their own countrymen.I know that there is another account of this matter,which represents the town to have been betrayed bythe Samnites ; but I have chosen to follow the writersmost worthy of credit: besides, the treaty of Neapolis,for to that place the seat of government of the Greekswas then transferred, renders it more probable that therenewal of friendship was voluntary on their side.

Immedi­ately after his triumph he led his army into winterquarters in the territory of Vescia, that country beingexposed to the inroads of the Samnites. Meanwhile,in Etruria, the consul Carvilius first laid siege to Troi-lium, when four hundred and seventy of the richestinhabitants, offering a large sum of money for permis­sion to leave the place, he suffered them to depart:the town with the remaining multitude he took bystorm. He afterwards reduced by force five fortsstrongly situated, wherein were slain two thousandfour hundred of the enemy, and not quite two thou­sand made prisoners. To the Faliscians, who suedfor peace, he granted a truce for a year, on conditionof their furnishing a hundred thousand asses in weight,1and a year's pay for his army. This business com­pleted, he returned home to a triumph, which, thoughit was less illustrious than that of his colleague, in re­spect of his share in the defeat of the Samnites, wasyet raised to an equality with it, the whole honor ofthe campaign in Etruria belonging solely to him. Hecarried into the treasury three hundred and ninetythousand asses in weight.2 Out of the remainder ofthe money accruing to the public from the spoils hecontracted for the building of a temple to Fors Fortu-na, near to that dedicated to the same goddess by kingServius Tullius; and gave to the soldiers, out of thespoil, one hundred and two asses3 each, and doublethat sum to the centurions and horsemen : this dona­tive was received the more gratefully on account ofthe parsimony of his colleague.

is generally the case, dismayed by the fall of theirleader, but rather roused to fury. All who were withinreach darted their weapons at Aulins, who incautiouslypushed forward among the enemy's troops; but thechief share of the honor of revenging the death of theSamnite general was reserved for his brother, who,urged by rage and grief, dragged down the victoriousmaster of the horse from his seat, and slew him. Ashe fell in the midst of their troops, the Samnites werealso near keeping possession of his body: but the Ro­mans instantly dismounting, the Samnites were obligedto do the same; and thus were lines formed suddenly,and a battle began on foot, round the bodies of the ge­nerals, in which the Romans had manifestly the advan­tage ; and recovering the body of Aulius, carried itback in triumph to the camp, with hearts filled with amixture of joy and grief. The Samnites having losttheir commander, and made a trial of their strength inthis contest between the cavalry, left Saticula, whichthey despaired of relieving, and returned to the siegeof Plistia: within a few days after which the Romansgot possession of Saticula by capitulation, and theSamnites of Plistia by force.
23. The seat of the war was then changed. The le­gions were led away from Samnium and Apulia toSora. This city had revolted to the Samnites, and putto death the Roman colonists. The Roman army hav­ing arrived here first, by forced marches, with the pur­pose of revenging the murder of their countrymen, andrecovering possession of the colony, and the scouts whowere scattered about the roads bringing intelligence,one after another, that the Samnites were following atno great distance, they marched to meet the enemy,and at Lautulae fought them with doubtful success.Neither loss nor flight on either side, but the night,separated the combatants, uncertain whether they werevictorious or defeated.

45. In the succeeding consulate of Publius SulpiciusSaverrio and Publius Sempronius Sophus, [A. U. C.449. B. C. 303] the Samnites, desirous either of atermination or a cessation of hostilities, sent ambassa­dors to Rome to treat of peace; to whose submissivesolicitations this answer was returned, that, ' had notthe Samnites frequently solicited peace, at times whenthey were actually preparing for war, their present ap­plication might, perhaps, in the course of negotiating,have produced the desired effect. But now, since wordshad bitherto proved vain, people's conduct might beguided by facts: that Publius Sempronius the consulwould shortly be in Samnium with an army: that hecould not be deceived in judging whether their disposi­tions inclined to peace or war. He would bring thesenate certain information respecting every particular,and their ambassadors might follow the consul on hisreturn from Samnium.' The Roman accordinglymarched through all parts of Samnium, found everything in a state of peace, and was liberally suppliedwith provisions; on which, a renewal of the old treatywas this year granted to the Samnites. The Romanarms were then turned against the jEquans, their oldenemies, but who bad, for many years past, remainedquiet, under a fallacious appearance of friendship. Thereason of making war on them was, that while the Her-nicians were in a state of prosperity, these had, in con­junction with them, frequently sent aid to the Sam-nites; and after the Hernicians were subdued, almostthe whole nation, without dissembling that they actedby public authority, had revolted to the enemy; andwhen, after the conclusion of the treaty with the Sam­nites at Rome, ambassadors were sent to demand satis­faction, they said that ' this was only a trial made ofthem, on the expectation that they would through fear

the greater part of the day, while very many fell onboth sides; and night came on before it could be disco­vered to which side victory inclined. But the follow­ing dawn showed the conqueror and the vanquished;for the Etrurians had decamped in the dead of thenight. The Romans, marching out with intent to re­new the engagement, and seeing their superiority ac-knowleged by the departure of the enemy, advanced totheir camp; and, finding even this fortified post de­serted, took possession of it, together with a vastquantity of spoil. The consul then, leading back hisforces into the Faliscian territory, and leaving hisbaggage with a small guard at Falerii, set out with histroops, lightly accoutred, to ravage the enemy's coun­try : and not only was the ground laid waste, but theirforts also and smaller towns were destroyed by fire.He did not, however, lay siege to the cities, into whichthe Etrurians had been hurried by their fears. Theother consul, Fulvius, fought the Samnites at Bovia-num, where he gained great honor, and a completevictory. Then attacking the town, and soon after Au-fidena, he took both by assault. This year a colonywas carried out to Carseoli, in the territory of thejEquicolae. The consul Fulvius triumphed on his de­feat of the Samnites.
13. Shortly before the election of consuls a reportprevailed that the Etrurians and Samnites were raisingvast armies; that the leaders of the Etrurians were, inall their assemblies, openly censured for not havingprocured the aid of the Gauls on any terms ; and themagistrates of the Samnites arraigned, for having op­posed to the Romans an army destined to act againstthe Lucanians. That, in consequence, the people wererising up in arms, with all their own strength and thatof their allies combined ; and that this affair seemednot likely to be terminated without a contest of muchgreater difficulty than the former.

from the bank of the Rhone the consul Pnblius Cor­nelius had come with his forces in order of battleto the camp of the enemy, intending to fight themwithout delay. But finding the fortifications aban­doned, and concluding that, as they had got the startof him so far, it would be difficult to overtake them, heinarched back to the sea, where his ships lay ; for hejudged that he might thus with greater ease and safetymeet Hannibal on his descent from the Alps. How­ever, not to leave Spain, the province which the lotshad assigned to his care, destitute of the aid of Ro­man troops, he sent his brother Cneius Scipio withthe greater part of his forces against Hasdrubal, withthe expectation not merely of protecting old allies, andacquiring new, but of driving him out of Spain. Hehimself, with a very small force, repaired to Genoa,proposing, with the army which was stationed on thePo, to provide for the security of Italy. From theDruentia, Hannibal, passing through a tract in generallevel, without any molestation from the Gauls inha­biting those regions, arrived at the Alps. And now,notwithstanding that the men had already conceived'notions of the scene from report, which, in cases capa­ble of misrepresentation, generally goes beyond thetruth, yet the present view exhibited such objects asrenewed all their terrors ; the height of the mountains,the snows almost touching the sky, the wretched hutsstanding on the cliffs, the cattle and beasts shivering withthe cold, the people squalid and in uncouth dress, allthings, in short, animate and inanimate, stiffened withfrost, besides other circumstances more shocking tothe sight than can be represented in words. As theymarched up the first acclivities, they beheld the emirnences which hung over them covered with parties ofthe mountaineers, who, if they had posted themselvesin the valleys out of view, and, rushing out suddenly,had made an unexpected attack, must have occasionedthe most terrible havoc and dismay.

arms behind. By this battle the power of the Etru­rians was, a second time, effectually crushed, so that,engaging to furnish a year's pay, and corn for twomonths, with the dictator's permission, they sent am­bassadors to Rome to treat of peace. This was refused,but a truce for two years was granted to them. Thedictator returned into the city in triumph. I haveseen it asserted that tranquillity was restored intoEtruria by the dictator, without any memorable battle,only by composing the dissensions of the Arretians,and effecting a reconciliation between the Cilnian fa­mily and the commons. Marcus Valerius was electedconsul, before the expiration of his dictatorship, manyhave believed, without his soliciting the office, andeven while he was absent; and that the election washeld by an interrex. In one point all agree, that beheld the consulship with Quintus Appuleius Pansa.
6. During this consulate of Marcus Valerius andQuintus Appuleius affairs abroad wore a very peace­able aspect. Their losses sustained in war, togetherwith the truce, kept the Etrurians quiet. The Sam-nites, depressed by the misfortunes of many years,had not yet become dissatisfied with their new alliance.At Rome also, the carrying away of such multitudesto colonies rendered the commons tranquil, and light­ened their burdens. But, that all things might notstagnate in a dead calm, a contention was excited be­tween the principal persons in the commonwealth, pa­tricians on one hand, and plebeians on the other, bythe two Ogulnii, Quintus and Cneius, plebeian tri­bunes, who seeking every where occasions of crimi­nating the patricians in the hearing of the people, andhaving found other attempts fruitless, engaged in ascheme calculated to inflame, not the lowest class ofthe commons, but their chief men, the plebeians ofconsular and triumphal rank, to the completion ofwhose honors nothing was now wanting but the officesof the priesthood, which were not yet laid open tothem.

and carried off six standards. As soon as the troopshad got clear of that difficult and troublesome passthe Gauls ceased from their attempts, and the Romansfrom their fears, and the latter afterwards, easily se­curing the safety of their march through the opencountry, proceeded to Tanetum, a small town on thePo.' Here by means of a temporary fortificationwhich they raised the supply of provisions conveyedby the river, and the aid of the Brescian Gauls, theymaintained their ground against the numerous forcesof the enemy, though daily augmented.
26. When news of this sudden insurrection arrivedat Rome, and the senate understood that, besides theCarthaginian war, they had another to maintain withthe Gauls, they ordered Caius Atilius, a pretor, tomarch to the relief of Manlius with one Roman legion,and five thousand allied troops, enlisted by the consul inthe late levy: with these he arrived at Tanetum withoutany interruption ; for the enemy, through fear, had re­tired at his approach. At the same time Publius Cor­nelius, having raised a new legion in the room of thatwhich had been sent with the pretor, set out from thecity with sixty ships of war ; and coasting along Etru-ria, Liguria, and the Salyan mountains, he arrived atMarseilles, and pitched his camp on the nearest mouthof the Rhone ; for that river, dividing itself, flows intothe sea through several channels ; scarcely believingyet that Hannibal had passed the Pyrenean moun­tains. But when he learned that he had, even then,employed in preparations for passing the Rhone, beingunable to determine in what place he might meet him,and his men being not yet sufficiently recovered fromthe fatigue of the voyage, he despatched three hun­dred chosen horsemen, guided by some Massilians andauxiliary Gauls, to gain information of every particu­lar, and to take a view of the enemy, without danger.Hannibal procuring, either by threats or presents, anunmolested passage through the other provinces, hadarrived at the country of the Volcae, a powerful state.These possessed territories on both sides of the Rhone;

38. In this manner, as nearly as can be ascertained,they accomplished their passage into Italy, in the fifthmonth, according to some authors, after leaving NewCarthage, having spent fifteen days in crossing theAlps. As to what number of forces Hannibal had,when he arrived in Italy, writers by no means agree.Those who state them at the highest make them amountto one hundred thousand foot and twenty thousandhorse; while those who state them at the lowest saytwenty thousand foot and six of horse. The authorityof Lucius Cincius Alimentus, who writes that he wastaken prisoner by Hannibal, would have the greatestweight with me, did he not confound the number hyadding the Gauls and Ligurians. He says that, in­cluding these, (who, it is more probable, however,flocked to him afterwards, and so some writers assert,)there were brought into Italy eighty thousand foot andten thousand horse; and that he heard from Hannibalhimself, that from the time of his passing the Rhonehe had lost thirty-six thousand men, together with avast number of horses and other beasts of burden, be­fore he left the country of the Taurinians, the nextnation to the Gauls as he went down into, Italy. Thathe came through this state is agreed on by all. I amtherefore the more surprised at its remaining doubtfulby what road he crossed the Alps, and that the opi­nion should commonly prevail that he passed over thePennine hill, and that from thence that summit of thesemountains got its name. Coelius says that he passedover the hill of Cremo. Either of these passes wouldhave led him, not into the territory of the Taurinians,but through that of the mountaineers, called Salassians,to the Libuan Gauls. Nor is it probable that those\ roads into Hither Gaul should, at that time, have beenopen : those, especially, which lead to the Penninehill would have been blocked up by nations half Ger­man.

mutual admiration ; for the name of Hannibal, evenbefore the destruction of Saguntum, was highly famedamong the Romans; and the very circumstance of Sci-pio having been particularly chosen for the command,supposed him a person of extraordinary merit. Theywere exalted still higher in each other's opinion: Sci-pio, by the celerity with which, though left behind inGaul, he had met Hannibal at his coming down intoItaly; Hannibal, by having not only formed but exe­cuted the daring design of passing over the Alps.Scipio however first crossed the Po, and removed hiscamp to the river Ticinus; where, wishing to encou­rage his soldiers before he led them out to battle, headdressed them in a speech to this effect:—
40. ' Soldiers, if I were marching to battle at thehead of the army which I had with me in Gaul, Ishould have thought it needless to use any words toyou: for why exhort either those horsemen, who with­out difficulty defeated the enemy's cavalry at the riverRhone; or those legions, with whom I pursued thissame enemy, and obtained, by their refusing to fight,and actually flying before us, an acknowlegement ofvictory ? In the present state of things, as that armywhich was enlisted for .the province of Spain is em­ployed with my brother Cneius Scipio, under my aus­pices, in the place where it was the will of the senateand people of Rome that it should be employed; andthat I, in order that you might have a consul to leadyou against Hannibal and the Carthaginians, havetaken a voluntary part in this contest;—as a new com­mander, I think it requisite to speak a few words tosoldiers who are new to me. Now, that you shouldnot be unacquainted either with the nature of the waror with the enemy,' know, soldiers, that you are tofight against men whom, in the former war, you con­quered both on land and sea; from whom you haveexacted tribute for twenty years past; from whom youtook, and still hold, Sicily and Sardinia, the prices ofyour victory.

them with improper notions, he crossed the Pyrenees,with the rest of his forces, and pitched his camp nearthe town of Illiberis. The Gauls had been told thathis operations were directed against Italy ; neverthe­less, having been informed that the Spaniards on theother side of the Pyrenees bad been reduced by force,ancr that a powerful guard was stationed in their coun­try, they were so much alarmed for their liberty thatthey hastily took arms, and several states formed ageneral meeting at Ruscino. When Hannibal was in­formed of this, dreading delay more than the power ofthe enemy, he despatched envoys to their petty princes,acquainting them that he wished to confer with them inperson, and proposing that either they should comenearer to Illiberis, or that he would advance to Rus­cino ; that he would with great pleasure receive themin his camp, or without hesitation go himself to theirs;for he came into Gaul as a friend, not as an enemy,and meant not to draw a sword, if the Gauls wouldallow him to hold his resolution, until he arrived inItaly. This passed through messengers; but the Gaulsimmediately removed their camp to Illiberis, camewithout reluctance to the Carthaginian, and were sohighly captivated by his presents, that, with greatcheerfulness, they conducted his army, by the town ofRuscino, through their territories. '
25. In Italy, at this time, nothing farther was knownthan that Hannibal had passed the Iberus, intelligenceof which had been brought to Rome by ambassadorsfrom Marseilles ; yet, as if he had already passed theAlps, the lioians, engaging the concurrence of the In-subrians, began a revolt, their motive for which wasnot their ancient enmity towards the Roman people,but the offence which they lately conceived at theestablishment of the colonies on the Po, at Cremona,and Placentia, within the limits of the Gallic territo­ries. For this reason, they hastily took arms, andmaking an irruption into those very soils, caused suchterror and confusion, that not only the country people,but even the Roman commissioners,who had come thither

might be wielded with ease; a loose coat of mail alsohelped to defend the breast, and the left leg was co­vered with a greave; their helmets were adorned withplumes, to add to the appearance of their stature. Thegolden-armed soldiers wore tunics of various colors ;the silver-armed, of white linen. To the latter theright wing was assigned; the former took post on theleft. The Romans had been apprised of these splendidaccoutrements, and had been taught by their command­ers that ' a soldier ought to be rough; not decoratedwith gold and silver, but placing his confidence in hissword : that matters of this kind were in reality spoilrather than armor; glittering before action, but soonlosing their brilliancy when besmeared with blood :that the brightest ornament of a soldier was valor: thatall those trinkets would follow victory ; and that thoserich enemies would be valuable prizes to the poorerconquerors.' Cursor, having animated his men withthese observations, led them on to battle. He tookpost himself on the right wing, giving the command ofthe left to the master of the horse. At the first onsetthe conflict between the two armies became desperate,while the dictator and the master of the horse wereeagerly contending on which wing victory should firstshow itself. It happened that Junius first, with theleft wing, made the right of the enemy give way; thisconsisted of men devoted after the custom of the Sam-nites, and on that account distinguished by white gar­ments and armor of equal whiteness. Junius, saying'he would sacrifice these to Pluto,' pressed forward,disordered their ranks, and made an evident impres­sion : which being perceived by the dictator, he ex­claimed, ' Shall the battle begin on the left wing; andshall the right, the dictator's own troops, only secondthe arms of others, and not claim the greatest share ofthe victory?' This spurred on the soldiers: nor didthe cavalry yield to the infantry in bravery, nor theardor of lieutenant-generals to that of the commanders.Marcus Valerius from the right wing, and PubliusDecius from the left, both men of consular rank, rode

try on this side of the Iherus. Scipio, leading his army10 take vengeance on the Illergetans, thus abandonedby the author of their revolt, and driving them all intoAthanagia, invested the city, which was the capital ofthe state. In the space of a few days he reduced themto intire submission and obedience, compelled thein togive a greater number of hostages than before, and alsoto pay a sum of money as a fine. From thence he pro­ceeded against the Ausetanians near the Iberus, whohad likewise joined in a league with the Carthaginians.After he had invested their city, the Lacetans attemptedby night to bring succor to their neighbors; but hesurprised them by an ambuscade, when they were closeto the city, and just about to enter; twelve thousand ofthem were slain, and the rest, mostly without theirarms, dispersing up and down through the country,fled to their homes by different ways. Neither wouldthe besieged have beeu able to make a defence, but forthe severity of the winter, which obstructed the opera­tions of the besiegers. The siege lasted thirty days,during which the snow lay seldom less than four feetdeep, and it had covered over the machines and enginesof the Romans, in such a manner, as that of itself aloneit proved a sufficient defence against the fires whichwere often thrown on them by the enemy. At last,Hamusitus their chieftain, having fled away to Has-drubal, they capitulated on the terms of paying twentytalents of silver.1 The army then returned into winterquarters at Tarraco.

During this winter, at Rome and in its vicinity,many prodigies either happened, or, as is not unusualwhen people's minds have once taken a turn towardssuperstition, many were reported and credulously ad­mitted.

20. Marcus Foslius Flaccinator and Lucius Plau-tius Venno were the next raised to the consulship.[A.U.C.436. B.C. 316.] In this year ambassadors camefrom most of the states of the Samuites to procure arenewal of the treaty ; and, having moved the compas­sion of the senate by the humility with which theyprostrated themselves before them, were referred tothe people, with whom they found not their prayers soefficacious. Their petition, therefore, with regard tothe treaty, was rejected; but, after a supplication ofseveral days, they obtained a truce for two years. TheTeaneans likewise, and Canusians of Apulia, worn outby the devastations of their country, surrendered them­selves to the consul, Lucius Plautius, and gave hos­tages. This year prefects first began to be created forCapua, and a code of laws was given to that nation byLucius Furins the pretor; both in compliance withtheir own request, as a remedy for the disorder oftheir affairs, occasioned by intestine dissensions. AtRome two additional tribes were constituted, the Ufen-tine and Falerine. On the affairs of Apulia fallinginto decline, the Teatians of that country came to thenew consuls, Caius Junius Bubulcus and Quintus/Emilius Barbula, suing for an alliance [A. U. C. 437.B.C. 315], and engaging that peace should be observedtowards the Romans through every part of Apulia.By pledging themselves boldly for this they obtainedthe grant of an alliance, not however on terms of equa­lity, but of their submitting to the dominion of theRoman people. Apulia being intirely reduced, (forJunius had also gained possession of Forentum, a townof great strength,) the consuls advanced into Lucania;

they commanded to be rased to the ground, and hiseffects to be devoted to Semo Sancus. With the mo­ney produced by the sale of them brazen globes wereformed, and placed in the chapel of Sancus, oppositeto the temple of Quirinus. As to the senate of Pri-vernum, it was commanded that every person who hadcontinued to act as a senator of Privernum, after therevolt from the Romans, should reside on the fartherside of the Tiber, under the same restrictions as thoseof Velitrse. After the passing of these decrees therewas no farther mention of the Privernians until Plau-tius had triumphed. When that ceremony was over,and Vitruvius, with his accomplices, had been put todeath, the consul thought that the people's resentmentbeing now fully gratified by the sufferings of the guilty,he might safely introduce the business of the Priver-nian state, which he did in the following manner:' Conscript fathers, since the authors of the revolt havereceived, both from the immortal gods and from you,the punishment due to their crime, what do you judgeproper to be done with respect to the guiltless multi­tude? For my part, although my duty consists ratherin collecting the opinions of others than in offering myown, yet, when I reflect that the Privernians are si­tuated in the neighborhood of the Samnites, with whomit is exceedingly uncertain how long we shall be atpeace, I cannot help wishing that as little ground ofanimosity as possible may be left between them andus.'
21. The affair naturally admitted of a diversity ofopinions; while each, agreeably to his particular tem­per, recommended either severity or lenity; and thedebate was still farther perplexed by the behavior ofone of the Privernian ambassadors, more conformableto the prospects to which he had been born than to theinsuperable exigency of the present juncture : for beingasked, by one of the advocates for severity, ' Whatpunishment he thought the Privernians deserved V heanswered, ' Such as those deserve who deem them­selves worthy of liberty.'

You are therefore no way concerned, eitherwith us, to whom you gave no commission ; nor withthe Samnites, with whom you transacted no business.We are sureties to the Samnites ; debtors, whose abili­ties are sufficiently extensive over that which is ourown, over that which we can offer—our bodies and ourminds. On these let them exercise their cruelty;against these let them whet their resentment and theirswords. As to what relates to the tribunes, you willconsider whether the delivering them up can be imme­diately effected, or if it must be deferred to anotherday. Meanwhile let us, Titus Veturius, and the restconcerned, offer our worthless persons as atonementsfor the non-performanco of our engagements, and byour sufferings liberate the Roman armies.'
10. These arguments, and still more, the person bywhom they were delivered, powerfully affected the se­nators ; as they did likewise every one, not exceptingeven the tribunes of the commons, who declared thatthey would be directed by the senate. They then in­stantly resigned their office, and were delivered toge­ther with the rest to the heralds to be conducted toCaudium. On passing this decree of senate, it seemedas if some new light had shone on the state: Postu-mius was in every mouth : they extolled him to hea­ven ; and pronounced him to have equalled in gloryeven the consul Publins Decius, who devoted him­self. * Through his counsel and exertions,' they said,' the republic had raised up its head, after being sunkin an ignominious peace. He now offered himself tothe enemy's rage, and to torments, and was sufferingin atonement for the Roman people.' All turned theirthoughts towards arms and war, and the general crywas, ' When shall we be permitted with arms in ourhands to meet the Samnites?' While the state glowedwith resentment and rancor, the levies were composedalmost intirely of volunteers. Legions, composed ofthe former soldiers, were quickly formed, and an army

Next day heled out against the enemy twelve thousand foot andfive thousand horse. Nor did the consul Sempronius(for he had by this time returned from Rome) declinea battle ; and, during that day, the armies lay en­camped within three miles of each other. On the fol­lowing, they fought with the greatest bravery and withvariable success. At the first onset the superioritywas so great on the side of the Romans, that they notonly had the better in the fight, but drove the enemyfrom their ground, pursued them to their camp, andpresently attacked the camp itself. Hannibal, afterposting a few to defend the rampart and gates, collectedthe rest in close order in the middle of the camp, or­dering them to watch attentively the signal for sallyingforth. It was now near the ninth hour of the day,when the Roman, having fatigued his troops withouteffect, and seeing no prospect of success, gave the sig­nal for retreat. As soon as Hannibal perceived thatthey slackened their efforts, and were retiring from thecamp, be instantly sent out bis cavalry against themon the right and left; and he himself, at the head ofthe main body of infantry, rushed out in the middle.Seldom has there been a fight more desperate, andnever perhaps one more remarkable for the loss onboth sides than this would have been, had the daylightallowed it to continue; but night put a stop to thebattle, while its fury was at the highest. The num­bers slain therefore were not great, in proportion tothe violence of the conflict; and as both parties hadmet nearly equal success, so they separated with equalloss. On neither side fell more than six hundred foot,and half that number of horse. But the loss of theRomans was more considerable in regard of the qua­

He feared, too,that Papirius might inscribe his name on the spoils, orcarry them in triumph. His letters also, containingan account of the success, being sent to the senate,showed plainly that he wished not to impart to thedictator any share of the honor ; who certainly viewedthe proceeding in this light, for while others rejoiced atthe victory obtained, he showed only surliness andanger : insomuch that, immediately dismissing the se­nate, he hastened out of the senate-house, and fre­quently repeated with warmth that the legions of theSamnites were not more effectually vanquished andoverthrown by the master of the horse, than were thedictatorial dignity and military discipline, if such con­tempt of orders escaped with impunity. Thus breath­ing resentment and menaces, he set out for the camp ;but though he travelled with all possible expedition,intelligence arrived before him that the dictator wascoming, eager for vengeance, and in every second sen­tence applauding the conduct of Titus Manlius.
31. Fabius instantly called an assembly, and in-treated the soldiers to ' show the same courage in pro­tecting bim, under whose conduct and auspices theyhad conquered, from the outrageous cruelty of thedictator, which they had so lately displayed in defend­ing the commonwealth from its most inveterate ene­mies.

valry to reconnoitre the adjacent grounds. For sometime neither party descried the other. Afterwards thedust being raised in thicker clouds by the moving of somany men and horses, gave notice of approaching ene­mies: both detachments halted, and made ready forbattle. Scipio placed his spearmen and Gallic ca­valry in front, keeping the Romans and the body ofallies which accompanied him as a reserve. Hannibaldrew the bridled cavalry into the centfe, strengtheninghis wings with the Numidians. The shout was scarcelyraised before the spearmen fled to the second line; thenthe battle was maintained by the cavalry, for a con­siderable time with doubtful success; but afterwards,in consequence of the confusion caused among thehorses by the footmen being intermixed with them,many of the riders fell from their seats, and others, onseeing their friends surrounded and distressed, dis­mounted to assist them; so that the fight was now car­ried on mostly on foot, until the Numidians, posted onthe wings, taking a small compass, showed»themselveson the rear. This terrified and dismayed the Romans,whose fears were augmented by a wound received bythe consul, who was rescued from farther danger bythe speedy intervention of his son, just arrived at theage of maturity. This is the same youth who is after­wards to enjoy the renown of terminating this war, andto receive the title of Africanus, on account of his glo­rious victory over Hannibal and the Carthaginians.However, very few fled precipitately, except the spear­men, on whom the Numidians made the first charge.The rest formed a compact body of cavalry; who,taking the consul into their centre, and covering him,not only with their arms, but with their bodies, withoutany disorder or precipitation in their retreat, broughthim back to the camp. Coelius attributes the honor ofsaving the consul to a slave, by nation a Ligurian: butI rather wish the account to be true which gives it tohis son ; and so the fact is represented by most authors,and generally believed.

man and of the unseasonableness of the juncture; in­somuch, that the senate would have proceeded to ordera dictator to be created, but that an assembly, held forthe purpose of substituting a new consul, was con­ducted agreeably to the wishes of people of the firstconsequence. All the votes and centuries concurredunanimously in appointing Marcus Valerius consul,the same whom the senate would have ordered to bemade dictator. They then commanded him to proceedimmediately into Etruria to the legions. His cominggave such a check to the Etrurians that not one ofthem dared thenceforward to appear on the outside oftheir trenches; their own fears operating as a blockade.Nor could the new consul, by wasting their lands andburning their houses, draw them out to an engage­ment ; for not only country houses, but numbers oftheir towns, were seen smoking and in ashes on everyside. While this war proceeded more slowly than hadbeen expected, an account was received of the break­ing out of another; which was, not without reason,regarded as terrible, in consequence of the heavy lossesformerly sustained by both parties. This account, givenby their new allies the Picentians, was, that the Sam-Miles were taking measures for a renewal of hostilities,and that they themselves had been solicited to jointherein. The Picentians received the thanks of thestate ; and a large share of the attention of the senatewas turned from Etruria towards Samnium. The pub-

born men, and the younger sort were obliged to enlist,but cohorts were formed of the elder citizens, and thesons of freedmen were incorporated in the centuries.Plans were formed for the defence of the city, and thechief command committed to the pretor, Publius Sem-pronius. However, the senate was exonerated of onehalf of their anxiety, by a letter from the consul, Lu­cius Volumnius, informing them that the army, whichhad ravaged Campania, had been defeated and dis­persed : whereon they decreed a public thanksgivingfor this success, in the name of the victors. The courtswere opened, after having been shut eighteen days, andthe thanksgiving was performed with much joy. Theythen turned their thoughts to devising measures for thefuture security of the country depopulated by the Sam-nites; and, with this view, resolved that two coloniesshould be settled on the frontiers of the Vescian andFalernian territories; one at the mouth of the riverLiris, which has received the name of Minturnae; theother in the Vescian forest, which borders on the Fa­lernian territory; where, it is said, stood Sinope, acity of Grecians, called thenceforth by the Roman colo­nists Sinuessa. The plebeian tribunes were chargedto procure an order of the commons, enjoining PubliusSempronius, the pretor, to create triumvirs for con­ducting the colonies to those places. But it was noteasy to find people to give in their names; because asettlement in those places was considered, nearly, as aperpetual advanced guard in a hostile country, not asa provision of land. From these employments the at­tention of the senate was drawn away by the Etrurianwar growing daily more formidable; and by frequentletters from AppiUs, warning them not to neglect thedisturbances in that quarter. Four nations, he told them,were uniting their arms; the Etrurians, the Samnites,the Umbrians, and the Gauls; and they had alreadyformed two separate camps, one spot being insufficientto contain so great a multitude. In consequence, thetime of the elections drawing nigh, the consul, LuciusVolumnitis, was recalled to Rome to hold them. Hav­

called after him, the Appian, and for having conveyedwater into the city. These works he performed alone ;for his colleague, overwhelmed with shame by reasonof the infamous and unworthy choice made of senators,had abdicated his office. Appius possessing that in­flexibility of temper which, from the earliest times,had been the characteristic of his family, held on thecensorship by himself. By direction of the same Ap­pius the Potitian family, in which the office of priestsattendant on the great altar of Hercules was hereditary,instructed some of the public servants in the rites ofthat solemnity, with the intention to delegate the sameto them. The consequence, as related, is wonderful tobe told, and sufficient to make people scrupulous ofdisturbing the established modes of religious solemni­ties : for though there were at that time twelve branchesof the Potitian family, all grown-up persons, and notfewer than thirty, yet they were every, one, togetherwith their offspring, cut off within the year ; so that thename of the Potitii became extinct, while the censorAppius also was pursued by the wrath of the gods;and, some years after, deprived of sight.
30. The consuls of the succeeding year [A.U.C. 443.B. C. 309] were Caius Junius Bubulcus a third time,and Quintus jEmilius Barbula a second. In the com­mencement of their office they complained before thepeople that, by the improper choice which had beenmade of members of the senate, that body had beendisgraced, several having been passed over who werepreferable to the persons chosen in ; and they declaredthat they would pay no regard to such election, made,without distinction of right or wrong, merely to gratifyinterest or humor: they then immediately called overthe list of the senate, in the same order which hadtaken place before the censorship of Appius Claudiusand Caius Plautius. Two public employments, bothrelating to military affairs, came this year into the dis­posal of the people; one being an order that sixteen ofthe tribunes, for four legions, should be appointed bythe people; whereas hitherto they had been generally

that expiation, the minds of men, which were distractedby discord, had been restored to their proper state, itwas resolved that a dictator should be nominated forthe purpose. Cneius Quintus being accordingly created,appointed Lucius Valerius master of the horse; and,as soon as the nail was driven, they abdicated theiroffices. [A. U. C. 424. B. C. 328.]
19. Lucius Papirius Crassus and Lucius PlautiusVenno were the consuls for the next year [A.U.C. 425.B. C. 327] ; in the beginning of which ambassadorscame to Rome from Fabrateria and Polusca, two Vol-scian stntes, praying to be admitted into alliance ; andpromising that, if they were protected against the armsof the Samnites, they would ever continue faithful andobedient subjects to the government of the Romanpeople. On this ambassadors were sent by the senate,to require of the Samnites that they should offer noviolence to the territories of those states ; and thisembassy produced the desired effect, rather becausethe Samnites were not yet prepared for war than thatthey were desirous of peace. This year war broke outwith the people of Privernum: these were supportedby the inhabitants of Fundi, of which country was alsothe commander-in-chief, Vitruvius Vaccus, a man ofconsiderable note, not only at home but at Rome also.He had a house on the Palatine hill, on the spot which,after the buildings were rased and the ground thrownopen, was called Vacciprata.1 He was committinggreat depredations in the districts of Setia, Norba, andCora; to oppose him therefore Lucius Papirius beganhis march, and took post at a small distance from hiscamp. Vitruvius neither took the prudent resolutionof remaining within his trenches, in the presence of anenemy, his superior in strength, nor had he the cou­rage to fight at any great distance from them. With­out either judgment in forming, or boldness in exe­cuting his plan, he entered on an engagement whilethe last of his troops had scarcely got out of the gate

of fifty sail for the pretor Marcus jEmilius; and, aftersettling the affairs of Sicily, sailed himself with tenships along the coast of Italy to Ariminum, from whencehe marched his army to the river Trebia, and formeda junction with his colleague. '
52. And now, both the consuls and the whole of theRoman strength being opposed to Hannibal, affordedsufficient reason to suppose either that the Roman em­pire would be effectually protected by that force, orthat there would be no room for any farther hopes.Nevertheless, Scipio, dispirited' by the event of thebattle between the cavalry, and by his own wound,wished to defer coming to action; while Sempronius,whose spirit had yet met no check, and who thereforepossessed the greater confidence, was impatient of anydelay. The lands between the Trebia and the Po wereat that time inhabited by Gauls, who during thisstruggle between two such potent nations, showed nopartiality to either party, evidently intending to courtthe favor of the conqueror. With this conduct theRomans were well satisfied, provided they kept them­selves intirely quiet; but the Carthaginian was highlydispleased, giving out that he had come thither on aninvitation from the Gauls, to set them at liberty. In'order to gratify his resentment on that account, andat the same time to maintain his troops with plunder,he ordered two thousand foot and one thousand horse,mostly Numidians, with some Gauls intermixed, toravage the whole country, from thence onward to thebanks of the Po. The Gauls, destitute of support,though they had hitherto kept their inclinations doubt­ful, being now compelled by necessity, declared againstthe authors of their sufferings in favor of those whowere to avenge them; and sent ambassadors to theconsul to implore the aid of the Romans for a countrywhich was suffering severely, in consequence of thistoo faithful attachment of its inhabitants to the peopleof Rome.

such a vast number of soldiers being brought by tbeships, and another army quite unexpected pressing ontheir rear. The Gauls finding that, instead of being theassailants, as they had intended, they were even drivenfrom their own ground, made off hastily through theclearest opening that they could find, and in the utmostconfusion dispersed to their several towns. Hannibalnow looked with contempt on the boisterous menacesof this people, and bringing over the rest of his forcesat leisure, encamped on the spot. Various plans Ishould suppose were projected for conveying the ele­phants across the river, at least the accounts trans­mitted of the manner in which it was performed arevarious. Some relate, that being brought all togetherto the river side, the fiercest among them was provokedto anger by his keeper, who pursued him by swimmingas he fled into the water; that this drew down the restof the herd ; and that each, as soon as he lost the bot­tom, was by the mere force of the stream hurried to theopposite bank. But it is more generally agreed thatthey were carried over on rafts; and as this must haveappeared the safer method, it is now more easy to be­lieve that the business was so effected. One raft, oftwo hundred feet in length, and fifty in breadth, wasextended from the bank into the river, the upper partof it being firmly fastened to the shore with severalstrong cables, to prevent its being carried down withthe stream, and this was covered with a layer of earth,like a bridge, in order that the beasts might withoutfear walk on it as on solid ground. Another raft ofequal breadth, and one hundred feet long, was fastenedto this, and when the elephants, being driven over thefixed raft as on a road, the females going foremost,passed over to the smaller one which was joined to it,then the ropes with which this latter had been slightlytied were instantly loosed, and it was towed away byseveral light vessels to the other bank. When the firstwere thus landed, it was brought back for the rest. Aslong as they were driven, as it were, on a bridge con­nected with the land, they showed no signs of fear:

Then collecting the spoils, he rodeback to his men, and, together with his troop, who ex­ulted with joy, proceeded to the camp, and so on tohis father, without ever reflecting on the nature or theconsequences of his conduct, or whether he had meritedpraise or punishment. ' Father,', said he, ' that allmen may justly attribute to me the honor of beingdescended of your blood, having been challenged tocombat, I bring these equestrian spoils taken from myantagonist, whom I slew.' Which, when the consulheard, turning away instantly from the youth in anangry manner, he ordered the assembly to be calledby sound of trumpet; and when the troops had cometogether in full numbers, he spoke in this manner:' Titus Manlius, for as much as you, in contempt ofthe consular authority, and of the respect due to afather, have, contrary to our edict, fought with theenemy out of your post; and, as far as in you lay,subverted the military discipline, by which the powerof Rome has to this day been supported ; and havebrought me under the hard necessity either of over­looking the interests of the public, or my own, andthose of my nearest connexions; it is fitter that weundergo the penalty of our own transgressions, thanthat the commonwealth should expiate our offences soinjurious to it.

Lately, within these last ten years,Caius Maenius, dictator, having enforced inquiries,with more strictness than consisted with the safety ofsome powerful men, a charge was thrown out by hisenemies, that he himself was infected with the verycrime against which his inquiries were directed ;—nowMaenius, I say, in order that he might in a private ca­pacity meet the imputation, abdicated the dictatorship.I expect not such moderation in you ; you will not de­generate from your family, of all others the most im­perious and assuming ; nor resign your office a day, oreven an hour before you are forced to it. Be it so:but then let no one exceed the time limited. It isenough to add a day, or a month to the censorship.But Appius says, I will hold the censorship, and holdit alone three years anS six months longer than is al­lowed by the jEmilian law. Surely this is like ab­solute power. Or will you fill up the vacancy withanother colleague, a proceeding not allowable, evenin the case of the death of a censor? You are notsatisfied with having, as if you were a religious censor,hindered the most ancient solemnity, and the only oneinstituted by the very deity, to whom it is performed,from being attended by priests of the highest rank, butdegraded it to the ministration of servants.

attacked by public authority or private, but whetherjustly or unjustly ? for with respect to a subject of ourgovernment, whether acting under direction of thepublic authority, or. not, the right of inquiry, and ofpunishing, is exclusively our own. The only point,then, that comes into discussion with you is, whetherthe act was allowable according to treaty ? Where­fore, since you chose that a distinction should bemade between what commanders do by public autho­rity, and what of their own will, there is a treaty sub­sisting between us, concluded by your consul Lutatius,in which provision is made for the interest of the alliesof both nations. But there is no clause in favor of theSaguntines ; for they were not at the time in alliancewith you. But then, in the treaty entered into withHasdrubal, the Saguntines are expressly exemptedfrom hostilities. In answer to which, I shall urgenothing but what I have learned from yourselves : foryou asserted that the treaty which your consul CaiusLutatius at first concluded with us, inasmuch as ithad been concluded without either the approbation ofthe senate, 'or an order of the people, was not bindingon you ; and that for that reason another treaty wasratified anew, under the sanction of public authority.Now if your treaties do not bind you, unless sanc­tioned by your approbation and order, surely thetreaty of Hasdrubal, under the same circumstances,cannot be binding on us. Cease therefore to talk, ofSaguntum, and the Iberus; and let your minds atlength give birth to the burden of which they are longin labor.' The Roman then, folding up a corner ofhis robe, said, ' Here we bring you peace, and war;take which you choose.' Which proposal they an­swered with an equal degree of peremtory heat, call­ing out, that ' he should give whichever he chose.'He then threw open the fold again, and said that' hegave war:' they with one voice replied, that ' they ac­cepted it; and with the same.spirit with which theyaccepted it, would prosecute it.'

slain or taken prisoners. The number of the prisonerswas seven thousand three hundred, who were all sentunder the yoke ; the killed amounted to four thousandeight hundred. The victory was not obtained withoutloss of blood on the side of the Romans: when theconsul took an account of the loss sustained in the twodays, the number returned of soldiers lost was seventhousand three hundred. During these transactionsin Apulia, the Samnites attempted to seize on Inte-ramna, a Roman colony situated on the Latine road,but being disappointed in their design on the town, em­ployed their troops in ravaging the country ; whence,as they were driving off spoil, consisting of men andcattle, together with the colonists who fell into theirhands, they met the consul returning victorious fromLuceria, and not only lost their booty, but marchingin disorder, in a long train, and heavily encumbered,were themselves cut to pieces. The consul by procla­mation summoned the owners to lnteramna, to claimand receive again their property, and leaving his armythere, went to Rome to hold the elections. On his ap­plying for a triumph, that honor was refused him, be­cause he had lost so many thousands of his soldiers ;and also, because he had sent the prisoners under theyoke without imposing any conditions.

The other consul, Postumius, finding no employ­ment for his arms in Samnium, led over his forces intoEtruria, where he first laid waste the lands of the Vol-sinians: and afterwards, on their marching out to pro­tect their country, gained a decisive victory over themat a small distance from their own walls. Two thou­sand two hundred of the Etrurians were slain ; the restowed their safety to the city being so near. The armywas then led into .the territory of Rusella, and there,not only were the lands wasted, but the town itselftaken.

The Romans happenedto have a consul, Titus Manlius, of a temper as vehe­ment as that of Annius, who, so far from restraininghis anger, openly declared that if the conscript fathersshould be so infatuated as to receive laws from a manof Setia, he would come into the senate, with his swordin hand, and put to death every Latine that he shouldfind in their house ; then turning to the statue of Jupi­ter, he exclaimed, 'Jupiter, hear these impious de­mands; hear justice and equity.

23. The senate received information from both theconsuls that there waj very little hope of peace withthe Samnites. Publilius informed them that two thou­sand soldiers from Nolae, and four thousand of the Sam­nites, had been received into Palrepolis, a measurerather forced on the Greeks by the Nolans, than agree­able to their inclination. Cornelius wrote that a levyof troops had been ordered, that all Samnium was inmotion, and that the neighboring states of Privernum,Fundi, and Formiae, were openly solicited to join them.It was thought proper that, before hostilities were com­menced, ambassadors should be sent to expostulate onthese subjects with the Samnites, who answered in ahaughty manner; they even went so far as to accusethe Romans of behaving injuriously towards them ; but,nevertheless, they took pains to acquit themselves ofthe charges made against them, asserting that ' theirstate had not given either counsel or aid to the Greeks,nor used any solicitations on their behalf to the Fun-dians, or Formians: for, if they were disposed to war,they had not the least reason to be diffident of theirown strength. However, they could not dissemble thatit gave great offence to the state of the Samnites,that Fregelhe, a town which they had taken from theVolscians, and demolished,- should have been rebuiltby the Romans; and that they should have establisheda colony within the territory of the Samnites, to whichtheir colonists gave the name of Fregellae. This injuryand affront, if not done away by the authors, they weredetermined themselves to remove by the most effectualmeans in their power.' One of the Roman ambassa­dors proposed to discuss the matter before their com­mon allies and friends ; on which their magistrate said,'Why do we disguise our sentiments? Romans, noconferences of ambassadors, nor arbitration of any per­son whatever, can terminate our differences; but theplains of Campania, in which we must fight: let ourarmies, therefore, meet between Capua and Suessula ;and there let us decide, whether the Samnite, or theRoman, shall hold the sovereignty <}f Italy.'

of the camp, and his men were in a disposition ratherto fly back thither than to face the enemy. After someslight efforts he was compelled to give up the contestintirely; but, by reason of the shortness of the dis­tance, and the ease with which he could regain hiscamp, he saved his army without much difficulty fromany great loss, few falling either in the action or in theretreat. As soon as it grew dark they removed inhaste and disorder to Privernum, choosing to intrusttheir safety to walls rather than to a rampart. Theother consul, Plautius, after wasting the country onevery side, and driving off the spoil, led his army fromPrivernum into the territory of Fundi. On enteringthe borders he was met by the senate of that state,who declared that ' they came not to intercede for Vi-truvius, and those who had followed his faction, butfor the peopl? of Fundi, who, in the judgment of Vi-truvius himself, were clear from all blame of the war,as he showed by repairing for safety after his defeat toPrivernum, and not to Fundi, his native city. AtPrivernum, therefore, the enemies of the Roman peo­ple were to be sought and punished; who, regardlessof their duty to both countries, had revolted at oncefrom Fundi and from Rome. The Fundians were in astate of peace, their minds were Roman, and impressedwith a grateful remembrance of the privilege of citizensimparted to them: they besought the consul that hewould not treat as enemies an unoffending people ; as­suring him that their lands, their city, and their per­sons, were, and ever should be, in the disposal of theRoman people.' The consul commended their con­duct ; and, despatching letters to Rome, that the Fun­dians had preserved their allegiance, turned his marchto Privernum. Claudius writes that he first inflictedpunishment on those who had been the principal abet­tors of the conspiracy; that three hundred and fiftywere sent in chains to Rome; but that the senate didnot accept their submission, because they thought thatthe people of Fundi meant, by consigning to punish­ment these men, who were mean and indigent, to se­cure impunity to themselves.

suffer themselves to be made Roman citizens. But howmuch that condition was to be wished for, they hadbeen taught by the Hernicians; who, when they hadthe option, preferred their own laws to the freedom ofthe Roman state. To people who wished for liberty tochoose what they judged preferable, the necessity ofbecoming Roman citizens would have the nature of apunishment.' In resentment of these declarations,uttered publicly in their assemblies, the Roman peopleordered war to be made on the jEquans ; and, in pro­secution of this new undertaking, both the consulsmarched from the city, and sat down at the distance offour miles from the camp of the enemy. The troops ofthe jEquans, like tumultuary recruits, in consequenceof their having passed such a number of years withoutwaging war on their own account, were all in disorderand confusion, without established officers and withoutcommand. Some advised to give battle, others to de­fend the camp ; the greater part were influenced byConcern for the devastation of their lands, likely to takeplace, and the consequent destruction of their cities,left with weak garrisons. Among a variety of proposi­tions, they however heard one which tended to transferevery man's attention from the public interests to thecare of his private concerns. It recommended that, atthe first watch, they should depart from the camp bydifferent roads, and carry all their effects into the cities,where they might be secured by the strength of thefortifications: this they all approved and warmly cele­brated. When the enemy were now dispersed throughthe country, the Romans, at the first dawn, marchedout to the field, and drew up in order of battle, but noone coming to oppose them, they advanced in a briskpace to the camp. Perceiving neither guards beforethe gates, nor soldiers on the ramparts, nor the usualbustle of a camp,—surprised at the extraordinary si­lence, they halted in apprehension of some stratagem.At length, passing over the rampart, and finding thewhole deserted, they proceeded to search out the tractsof the enemy.

Inthis state, the two parties, in neither of which the kingwas present, were suddenly attacked and overpoweredby the enemy, who, after putting them to the sword, em­ployed their whole force in blockading the post whereAlexander commanded in person. From this place theLucanian exiles sent emissaries to their countrymen,and, stipulating a safe return for themselves, promisedto deliver the king, either alive or dead, into theirpower. But he, bravely resolving to make an extra­ordinary effort, at the head of a chosen band, brokethrough the midst of their forces ; engaged singly, andslew the general of the Lucanians, and collecting to­gether his men who had been scattered in the retreat,arrived at a river where the ruins of a bridge whichhad been recently broken by the violence of the flood,pointed out his road. Here, while the soldiers were* fording the river on a very uneven bottom, one of them,almost spent with fatigue and apprehension, cried out,as a reflection on the odious name of it,—' You arejustly named Acheros (dismal):' which expression reach­ing the king's ears, and instantly recalling to his mindthe fate denounced on him, he halted, hesitating whe­ther he should cross over or not. Then Sotimus, oneof the royal band of youths which attended him, askedwhy he delayed in such a critical moment, and showedhim that the Lucanians were watching an opportunityto perpetrate some act of treachery : whereon the king,looking back, and seeing them coming towards him ina body, drew his sword and pushed on his horse throughthe middle of the river. He had now reached the shal­low, when a Lucanian exile, from a distance, transfixedhim with a javelin: after his fall, the current carrieddown his lifeless body, with the weapon sticking in it, tothe posts of the enemy : there it was mangled in a man­ner shocking to relate; for, dividing it in the middle,they sent one half to Consentia, and kept the other, asa subject of mockery, to themselves.

But, on the other hand, if our minds areat length penetrated by an ardent desire of liberty; ifthere be a confederacy subsisting; if alliance be equalityof rights; if the Romans have now reason to glory iaa circumstance, of which they were formerly ashamed,our being of the same blood with them; if they have,in our troops, such an army of allies that, by its junc­tion with their own, they double their strength ; sucha one, in short, as their consuls, either in commencingor concluding their own wars, would, very unwillingly,disunite from their party; why is there not a perfectand settled equalisation ? Why is it not permitted thatone of the consuls should be chosen from among theLatines ? and that they who supply an equal share ofstrength should be admitted to an equal share in thegovernment? This, indeed, considered in itself, wouldnot redound to our honor in any extraordinary degree ;as we should still acknowlege Rome to be the metropolisof Latium; but that it may possibly appear to do so, isowing to our tame resignation for such a length of time.But, if you ever wished to acquire a participation inthe government, the opportunity now presents itself,afforded to you by the bounty of the gods and yourown resolution. You have tried their patience by re­fusing the supply of troops: who can doubt that theywere incensed to the highest degree when we brokethrough a practice of more than two hundred years'continuance ?

That they wouldrather endure any consequence which might ensue,than show contempt to the recommendation of the Ta­rentines.' The consuls said that ' they embraced theomen, and prayed that the enemy might continue inthe resolution of not even defending their rampart.'Then, dividing the forces between them, they advancedto the works; and, making an assault on every side atonce, while some filled up the trenches, others toredown the rampart, and tumbled it into the trench. Allwere stimulated, not only by their native courage, butby the resentment which, since their disgrace, badbeen festering in their breasts. They made theirway into the camp; where, every one repeating thathere was not Caudium, nor the forks, nor the impass­able glens, where cunning haughtily triumphed overerror ; but Roman valor, which no rampart nor trenchcould ward off,—they slew without distinction those whoresisted, and those who fled, the armed and unarmed,freemen and slaves, young and old, men and cattle.Nor would any one have escaped had not the consulsgiven the signal for retreat; and, partly by commands,partly by threats, forced the soldiers out of the camp,where they were greedily indulging themselves inslaughter. As they were highly incensed at being thusinterrupted, a speech was immediately addressed tothem, assuring the soldiers that ' the consuls neitherdid, nor would fall short of any one of the soldiersin hatred towards the enemy ; on the contrary, as theyled the way in battle, so would they have done thesame in executing unbounded vengeance, had not theirinclinations been restrained by the consideration ofthe six hundred horsemen, who where confined ashostages in Luceria; for it was feared that the Sam-nites, through despair, might be hurried on blindly totake cruel revenge on them, before they perishedthemselves.'

Chap. 1. The year following [A.U.C. 433. B.C. 319]was distinguished by the convention of Caudium, somemorable on account of the misfortune of the Ro­mans. The consuls of the year were Titus VeturinsCalvinus and Spurius Postumius. The Samnites werethat year commanded by Caius Pontius, son to Heren-nius, born of a father most highly renowned for wis­dom, and himself a consummate warrior and com­mander. When the ambassadors, who had been sentto offer restitution, returned, without concluding apeace, he said in an assembly ' that you may not thinkthat no purpose has been effected by this embassy, beassured that whatever degree of anger the deities ofheaven had conceived against us, on account of the in­fraction of the treaty, has been hereby expiated. I amvery confident that whatever deities they were, whosewill it was that you should be reduced to the necessityof making restitution, it was not agreeable to them thatour atonement for the breach of treaty should be sohaughtily spurned by the Romans: for what morecould possibly be done towards appeasing the gods,and softening the anger of man, than we have done?The effects of the enemy, taken among the spoils, whichappeared to be our own by the right of war, we re­stored : the authors of the war, as we could not deliverthem up alive, we delivered to them dead : their goodswe carried to Rome, lest by retaining them any degreeof guilt should remain among us.

44. The joy of one Roman army was enhanced bythe success of the other. Each consul, with the ap­probation of his colleague, gave to his soldiers theplunder of the town which he had taken ; and, whenthe houses were cleared, set them on fire. Thus, onthe same day, Aquilonia and Cominium were both re­duced to ashes. The consuls then united their camps,where mutual congratulations took place between themand between their soldiers. Here, in the view of thetwo armies, Carvilius bestowed on his men commenda­tions and presents according to the desert of each ; andPapirius likewise, whose troops had been engaged in avariety of actions, in the field, in the assault of thecamp, and in that of the city, presented Spurius Nau-tius, Spurius Papirius, his nephew, four centurions,and a company of the spearmen, with bracelets andcrowns of gold:—to Nautius, on account of his beha­vior at the head of his detachment, when he had»terri­fied the enemy with the appearance as of a numerousarmy; to young Papirius, on account of his zealousexertions with the cavalry, both in the battle and inharassing the Samnites in their flight by night, whenthey withdrew privately from Aquilonia; and to thecenturions and company of soldiers, because they werethe first who gained possession of the gate and wall ofthat town. All the horsemen he presented with gor­gets and bracelets of silver, on account of their distin­guished conduct on many occasions. A council wasthen held to consider of the propriety either of re­moving both armies, or one at least, out of Samnium ;in which it was concluded that the lower the strengthof the Samnites was reduced, the greater perseveranceand vigor ought to be used in prosecuting the war untilthey should be effectually crushed, that Samnium mightbe given up to the succeeding consuls in a state of per­fect subjection.

than a rampart. From these they repelled the enemywith stones. Scipio considering that unless the busi­ness were effected during their first panic, and beforethey could recover their spirits, the attack of so stronga town would be very tedious, asked his soldiers ' ifthey could endure, without shame, that the other wingshould already have taken the camp, and that they,after all their success, should be repulsed from thegates of the city V Then, all of them loudly declaringtheir determination to the contrary, he himself ad­vanced the foremost to the gate, with his shield raisedover his head : the rest, following under the like coverof their shields conjoined, burst into the city, and dis­persing the Samnites, who were near the gate, tookpossession of the walls, but were deterred from push­ing forward by the smallness of their number.
42. Of these transactions the consul was for sometime ignorant, and was busily employed in callinghome his troops, for the sun was now hastening to set,and the approach of night rendered every place suspi­cious and dangerous, even to victorious troops. Hav­ing rode forward a considerable way, he saw on theright the camp taken, and heard on the left a shoutingin the city, with a confused noise of fighting and criesof terror. This happened while the fight was going onat the gate. When, on riding up nearer, he saw hisown men on the walls, and so much progress alreadymade in the business, pleased at having gained throughthe precipitate conduct of a few an opportunity ofstriking an important blow, he ordered the troopswhom he had sent back to the camp to be called out,and to march to the attack of the city: these, havingmade good their entrance on the nearest side, pro­ceeded no farther, because night approached. Beforemorning, however, the town was abandoned by theenemy.

through the Caudine forks. The nature of the place isthis: there are two deep glens, narrow, and coveredwith wood, connected together by mountains rangingon both sides from one to the other; between these liesa plain of considerable extent, abounding in grass andwater, and through the middle of which the passageruns: but before this is arrived at the first defile mustbe passed, while the only way back, is through the roadby which it was entered ; or if in case of resolving toproceed forward, it must be by the other glen, whichis still more narrow and difficult. Into this plain theRomans marched down their troops, by one of thosepasses through the cleft of a rock; and, when they ad­vanced to the other defile, found it blocked up by treesthrown across, with a mound of huge stones. Thestratagem of the enemy now became apparent; and atthe same time a body of troops was seen on the emi­nence over the glen. Hastening back, then, to theroad by which they had entered, they found that alsoshut up by such another fence, and men in arms. Then,without orders they halted ; amazement took possessionof their minds, and a strange kind of numbness of theirlimbs: they then remained a long time motionless andsilent, with their eyes fixed on each other, as if eachthought the other more capable of judging and advisingthan himself. After some time the consul's pavilionswere erected, and they got ready the implements forthrowing up works, although they were sensible that itmust appear ridiculous to attempt raising a fortificationin their present desperate condition, and when almostevery hope was lost. Yet not to add a fault to theirmisfortunes, they all without being advised or orderedby any one, set earnestly to work, and inclosed a campwith a rampart, close to the water, while themselves,besides enduring the haughty taunts of their enemies,seemed with melancholy to acknowlege the apparentfruitlessness of their labor.

Thus the embassy there proved equallyvain and fruitless, excepting that the ambassadors werereceived and admitted to audience. Hanno alone, inopposition to the sentiments of the senate, argued fortheir complying with the terms of the treaty, and washeard with great attention, rather out of the respectpaid to the dignity of his character, than from the ap­probation of the hearers. He said that ' he had for­merly charged and forewarned them, as they regardedthe gods, who were guarantees and witnesses of thetreaties, not to send the son of Hamilcar to the army.That man's shade,' said he, ' cannot be quiet, nor anyone descended from him; nor will treaties with Romesubsist as long as one person of the Barcine blood andname exists.

the disaster which had hefallen them. At first theyheard that the troops were shut up; afterwards thenews of the ignominious peace arrived ; and this causedgreater affliction than had been felt for their danger.On the report of their being surrounded a levy of menwas begun ; but when it was understood that the armyhad surrendered in so disgraceful a manner, the pre­parations were laid aside; and immediately, withoutany public directions, a general mourning took place,with all the various demonstrations of grief. The shopswere shut; and all business ceased in the forum bycommon consent, without any order for that purposebeing issued. Ornamented dresses1 were laid aside;and the public were in greater tribulation, if possible,than the vanquished themselves; they were not onlyenraged against the commanders, the advisers and sure­ties of the peace, but were filled with detestation evenof the unoffending soldiers, and asserted that theyought not to be admitted into the city. But thesetransports of passion were allayed by the arrival ofthe troops, in a state so deplorable, as was sufficient toconvert even anger into compassion; for they cameinto the city, not like men returning into their coun­try with unexpected safety, but in the habit, and withthe looks of captives, late in the evening; and theyhid themselves so closely in their houses that, for thenext and several following days, not one of them couldbear to come in sight of the forum or of the public.The consuls, shut up in private, transacted no officialbusiness, except that they were compelled, by a decreeof the senate, to nominate a dictator to preside at theelections.

Go, lictor: bind him to thestake.' Shocked to the last degree at such a cruel or­der, each looking on the axe as if drawn against him­self, all were quiet, through fear, rather than disci­pline. They stood therefore for some time motionlessand silent; but when the blood spouted from his se­vered neck, then their minds emerging, as it were,from the stupefaction in which they had been plunged,they all at once united their voices in free expressionsof compassion, refraining not either from lamentationsor execrations; and covering the body of the youthwith the spoils, they burned it on a pile, erected with­out the rampart, with every honor which the warmzeal of the soldiers could bestow on a funeral. Fromthence ' Manlian orders' were not only then consideredwith horror, but have been transmitted as a model ofausterity to future times. The harshness of this pu­nishment however rendered the soldiery more obedientto their commander; while the guards and watches,and the regulation of the several posts, were hence­forth attended to with greater diligence : this severitywas also found useful, when the troops, for the finaldecision, went into the field of battle.

The Romansformerly made use of targets; afterwards, when theycame to receive pay, they made shields for themselves,instead of the targets ; and their army, which before wascomposed of phalanxes, like those of the Macedonians,began to be formed in a line of distinct companies.

The Samnites, who stood in order of battle ata distance, close to the foot of the mountain, increasedthe fears of the Latines. But of all, whether citizensor allies, the principal share of honor was due to theconsuls ; one of whom drew down on his own singleperson all the dangers and threats denounced by thedeities either of heaven or hell ; while the other dis­played such a degree both of courage and conduct,that it is universally agreed among all who have trans­mitted to posterity an account of that battle, both La­tines and Romans, that, on whichever side Manliushad held the command victory must have attended.The Latines fled towards Minturnae. The body ofDecius was not found that day, night putting a stopto the search : on the following, it was discoveredpierced with a multitude of darts, amidst vast heaps ofslaughtered enemies, and his funeral was solemnised,under the direction of his colleague, in a manner suitedto his honorable death.

At this time Quintus Fa-bius Gurges, the consul's son, having prosecuted somematrons before the people on a charge of adultery,built with the money accruing from the fines whichthey were condemned to pay the temple of Venus,which stands near the circus. Still we have the warsof the Samnites on our hands, notwithstanding thatthe relation of them has already extended, in one con­tinued course, through four volumes of our history,and through a period of fortyrsix years, from the con­sulate of Marcus Valerius and Aulus Cornelius, whofirst carried the Roman arms into Samnium. And,not to recite the long train of disasters sustained byboth nations, and the toils which they underwent,which however were not sufficient to subdue theirstubborn fortitude ; even in the course of the last year,the Samnites, with their own forces separately, andalso in conjunction with those of other nations, hadbeen defeated by four several armies, and four gene­rals of the Romans, in the territory of Sentinum, inthat of the Pelignians, at Tifernum, and in the plainsof the Stellatians; had lost the general of the highestcharacter in their nation ; and now saw their allies inthe war, the Etrurians, the Umbrians, and the Gauls,

Therain, which was attended with a high wind, beingdriven directly into the men's faces, they at firsthalted, because they must either have cast away theirarms, or, if they persisted to struggle forward, wouldbe whirled round by the hurricane, and thrown on theground. Afterwards, scarcely able to respire, theyturned their backs to the wind, and for a while satdown. But now the whole atmosphere resoundedwith loud thunder, and lightnings flashed between thetremendous peals, by which all were stunned, and re­duced by terror nearly to a state of insensibility. Atlength, the violence of the rain abating, and the furyof the wind increasing, the more necessary it wasjudged to pitch their camp on the very spot wherethey had been surprised by the tempest. But this wasin a manner beginning their toils anew; for neithercould they well spread their canvass nor fix the poles;and such tents as they did get raised they could notkeep standing, the wind tearing and sweeping off everything in its way. And soon after, the water beingraised aloft by the force of the wind, and congealed bythe cold which prevailed above the summits of themountains, came down in such a torrent of snowy hail,that the men, giving over all their endeavors, threwthemselves flat on their faces, buried under, ratherthan protected by, their coverings. This was followedby cold so intense, that when they wished to rise fromamong the wretched crowd of prostrated men and cat­tle, they were for a long time unable to effect it, theirsinews being so stiffly frozen that they were scarcelyable to bend their joints. In some time, when, aftermany efforts, they at length regained the power of mo­tion, and recovered some degree of spirits, and whenfires began to be kindled in a few places, every onewho was unable to assist himself had recourse to theaid of others.

Raising the shout anew,they pressed forward, and as they advanced perceivedthe enemy more and more confused. The cavalry nowcould be seen by those in front, and Cornelius, turningabout to the several companies, made them understand,by raising his voice and hands, that he saw the standardsand bucklers of his own horsemen. On hearing which,and at the same time seeing them, they at once so farforgot the fatigue which they had endured, through al­most the whole day, and even their wounds, that theyrushed to the fray with as much vigor and alacrity asif they were coming fresh out of camp on receivingthe signal for battle. The Samnites could no longersustain the charge of horse and foot together: part ofthem, inclosed on both sides, were cut off; the restseparated and fled different ways. The infantry slewthose who were surrounded and made resistance ; andthe cavalry made great havoc of the fugitives, amongwhom fell their general. This battle crushed at lengththe power of the Samnites so effectually that, in alltheir meetings, they expressed so much discontent, andsaid, ' it was not at all to be wondered at, if in an im­pious war, commenced in violation of a treaty, whenthe gods were, with justice, more incensed against themthan men, none of their undertakings prospered. Theywere not to expect the crime, (for such an infraction oftreaties must be held,) to be expiated and atoned forwithout a heavy penalty. The only alternative theyhad, was whether the penalty should be the guiltyblood of a few, or the innocent blood of all.'

40. The rage of the soldiers was inflamed to a highdegree before; but, when the consul had recounted tothem all these circumstances, which he had learnedfrom deserters, they then, filled with confidence in bothdivine and human aid, with one universal shout, de­manded the battle ; were vexed at the action being de­ferred ; impatient under the intended delay of a dayand a night. Papirius, at the third watch, having re­ceived his colleague's letter, arose in silence, and sentthe keeper of the chickens to take the auspices. Therewas no one description of men in the camp who feltnot earnest wishes for the fight: the highest and thelowest were equally eager; the general watching theardor of the soldiers, and the soldiers that of the gene­ral. This universal zeal spread even to those employedin taking the auspices ; for the chickens having refusedto feed, the auspex ventured to misrepresent the omen,and reported to the consul that they had fed voraci­ously.1 The consul, highly pleased, and giving noticethat the auspices were excellent, and that they were to

20. While the two consular armies were employedin the siege of Privernum, one of the consuls was re­called to Rome, to preside at the elections. This yeargaols were first erected in the circus. While the at­tention of the public was still occupied by the Priver-nian war, it was forcibly attracted by an alarming re­port of the Gauls being in arms, a matter at no timeslighted by the senate. The new consuls, therefore,Lucius jEmilius Mamercinus and Caius Plautius, onthe calends of July, [A.U.C. 426. B.C. 326] the veryday on which they entered into office, received ordersto settle the provinces immediately between themselves.Mamercinus, to whom the Gallic war fell, was directedto levy troops, without admitting any plea of immu­nity : nay, it is said, that even the rabble of handi­crafts, and those of sedentary trades, of all the worstqualified for military service, were called out; bywhich means a vast army was collected at Veii, inreadiness to meet the Gauls. It was not thought pro­per to proceed to a greater distance, lest the Gaulsmight by some other route arrive at the city withoutbeing observed. In the course of a few days it wasfound, on a careful inquiry, that every thing on thatside was quiet at the time; and the whole force, whichwas to have opposed the Gauls, was then turned againstPrivernum. Of the issue of the business there aretwo different accounts : some say that the city wastaken by storm, and that Vitruvius fell alive into thehands of the conquerors; others, that the townsmen,to avoid the extremities of a storm, presented the rodof peace, and surrendered to the consul, and that Vi­truvius was delivered up by his troops. The senate,being consulted with respect to Vitruvius and the Pri-vernians, sent directions that the consul Plautius shoulddemolish the walls of Privernum, and, leaving a stronggarrison there, come home to enjoy the honor of atriumph ; at the same time ordering that Vitruviusshould be kept in prison until the return of the consul,and that he should then be beaten with rods, and put todeath.

battering-rams, demolished a considerable extent ofthe wall; and when Hannibal arrived he showed himthe whole ground covered with fresh ruins. The troopswere therefore led instantly against the citadel; andafter a furious engagement, in which great loss wassuffered on both sides, part of the citadel was taken.Small as were the hopes of in accommodation, attemptswere now made to bring it about by two persons ;Alcon, a Saguntine, and Alorcus, a Spaniard. Alcon,thinking that he might effect something by submissiveintreaties, went over to Hannibal by night, without theknowlege of the Saguntines ; but his piteous supplica­tions making no impression, and the terms offered byhis enemy being full of rigor, and such as might beexpected from an enraged and not unsuccessful assail­ant, instead of an advocate he became a deserter; af­firming, that if any man were to mention to the Sagun­tines an accommodation on such conditions, it wouldcost him his life ; for it was required that they shouldmake restitution to the Turdetans; should deliver upall their gold and silver ; and, departing from the citywith single garments, should fix their residence in what­ever place the Carthaginian should order. When Al­con declared that his countrymen would never acceptthese conditions of peace, Alorcus, insisting that whenmen's bodily powers are subdued, their spirits are sub­dued along with them, undertook the office of mediatorin the negotiation. Now he was at this time a soldierin the service of Hannibal, but connected with the stateof Saguntum in friendship and hospitality. Deliveringup his sword to the enemy's guards, he passed openlythrough the fortifications, and was conducted at hisown desire to the pretor. A concourse of people of'every kind having immediately assembled about theplace, the senate, ordering the rest of the multitude toretire, gave audience to Alorcus, who addressed themin this manner:

25. The consuls, leaving Sora, turned their opera­tions against the lands and cities of the Ausonians ; forall places had been set in commotion by the coming ofthe Samnites, when the battle was fought at Lautulae:conspiracies likewise had been formed in several partsof Campania; nor was Capua itself clear of the charge:nay, the business spread even to Rome, and occasionedinquiries to be instituted respecting some of the prin­cipal men there. However, the Ausonian nation fellinto the Roman power in the same manner as Sora, bytheir cities being betrayed : these were Ausona, Min-turn;e, and Vescia. Certain young men of the princi­pal families, twelve in number, having conspired tobetray their respective cities, came to the consuls, andinformed them that their countrymen, who had for along time before earnestly wished for the coming ofthe Samnites, on hearing of the battle at Lautulae, hadlooked on the Romans as defeated, and had assistedthe Samnites with supplies of men and arms ; but that,since the Samnites had been beaten out of the country,they were wavering between peace and war, not shut­ting their gates against the Romans, lest they shouldthereby invite an attack, yet determined to shut themif any troops should approach ; and that, while theirminds were in that fluctuating state, they might easilybe overpowered by surprise. By these men's advicethe camp was moved nearer; and soldiers were sent,at the same time, to each of the three towns; somearmed, who were to lie concealed in places near thewalls ; others, in the garb of peace, with swords hiddenunder their clothes, who, on the opening of the gatesat the approach of day, were to enter into the cities.These latter began with killing the guards; and, at thesame time, made the signal to the men in arms to hastenup from the ambuscades. Thus the gates were seized,and the three towns taken in the same hour and by the

and succeed to the power of his father. Hanno, theleader of the other faction, said, ' Although what Has-drubal demands seems reasonable, nevertheless, I donot think that his request ought to be granted;' and,when all turned their eyes on him with surprise at thisambiguous declaration, he proceeded: ' Hasdrubalthinks that he is justly intitled to demand from theson the bloom of youth which he himself dedicated tothe pleasures of Hannibal's father. It would howeverbe exceedingly improper in us, instead of a militaryeducation, to initiate our young men in the evil prac­tices of generals. Are we afraid lest too much timeshould pass before the son of Hamilcar acquires no­tions of the unlimited authority, and the parade of hisfather's sovereignty ; or that after he had, like a king,bequeathed our armies as hereditary property to hisson-in-law, we should not soon enough become slavesto his son ? I am of opinion that this youth should bekept at home, where he will be amenable to the lawsand to the magistrates ; and that he should be taughtto live on an equal footing with the rest of his coun­trymen ; otherwise this spark, small as it is, mayhereafter kindle a terrible conflagration.'
4. A few, particularly those of the best understand­ing, concurred in opinion with Hanno ; but, as it ge­nerally happens, the more numerous party prevailedover the more judicious. Hannibal was sent intoSpain, and on his first arrival attracted the notice ofthe whole army.' The veteran soldiers imagined thatHamilcar was restored to them from the dead, ob­serving in him the same animated look and penetratingeye; the same expression of countenance, and thesame features. Then, such was his behavior, and soconciliating, that in a short time the memory of bisfather was the least among their inducements to esteemhim. Never man possessed a genius so admirablyfitted to the discharge of offices so very opposite in theirnature as obeying and commanding: so that it was noteasy to discern whether he were more beloved by thegeneral or by the soldiers.

from me to act with spirit, than I from you to speakwith elegance: I now make you a final proposal,which will demonstrate, not which is the better orator,for that is not what the public wants, but which is thebetter commander. The provinces are Etruria andSamnium : make your choice ; I, with my own army,will undertake to manage the business of either.' Thesoldiers then, with loud clamors, requested that theywould in conjunction carry on the war in Etruria ;when Volumnius, perceiving that it was the generalwish, said, ' Since I have been mistaken in apprehend­ing my colleague's meaning, I will take care that thereshall be no room for mistake with respect to the pur­port of your wishes. Signify by a shout, whether youchoose that I should stay or depart.' On this', a shoutwas raised, so loud, that it brought the enemy out oftheir camp: they snatched up their arms, and marchedforward in order of battle. Volumnius likewise or­dered the signal to be sounded, and his troops to takethe field. It is said that Appius hesitated, perceivingthat, whether he fought or remained inactive, his col­league would enjoy the honor of the victory; andthat, afterwards, dreading lest his own legions shouldfollow Volumnius with the rest, he gave the signal atthe earnest desire of his men. On neither side werethe forces drawn up to advantage : for, on the one,Gellius Egnatius, the Samttite general, had gone outto forage with a few cohorts, and his men entered onthe fight, as the violence of their passions prompted,rather than under any directions or orders. On theother, the Roman armies neither marched out toge­ther, nor had time sufficient to form : Volumnius be­gan to engage before Appius came up, consequentlytheir front in the battle was uneven ; and by some ac­cidental interchange of their usual opponents, theEtrurians fought against Volumnius ; and the Sam-nites, after delaying some time on account of the ab­sence of their general, against Appius.

fortifications were demolished by the Sidicinians. Thesenate, highly displeased with the consuls, in conse­quence of whose dilatory proceedings their allies hadbeen disappointed of support, ordered a dictator to benominated. Caius Claudius Regillensis being accord­ingly appointed, chose Caius Claudius Hortator masterof the horse. A scruple afterwards arose concerningthe dictator, and the augurs having declared his crea­tion informal, both he and the master of the horse ab­dicated their offices. This year Minucia, a vestal,falling at first under suspicion of incontinence, becauseof her dressing in a style of elegance beyond whatbecame her situation, and being afterwards prosecutedbefore the pontiffs, on the testimony of a slave, was, bytheir decree, ordered to refrain from meddling in sa­cred rites, and to retain her slaves under her ownpower.1 Being afterwards brought to trial, she wasburied alive, at the Colline gate, on the right hand ofthe causeway in the Field of Wickedness, which wasso denominated, I suppose, from her crime. The sameyear Quintus Publilius Philo was the first plebeianelected pretor. He was opposed by the consul Sulpi-cius, who refused to admit him as a candidate ; but thesenate, having failed of carrying their point with re­spect to the highest offices, showed the less earnestnessabout the pretorship.
16. The following year, [A. U. C. 419.

have kept them shut up at Eryx until they perishedwith hunger, the severest suffering that man can un­dergo ; we might have carried over our victorious fleetto Africa; and in the space of a few days, without op­position, have demolished Carthage. At tbeir suppli­cations we granted pardon: we gave them liberty todepart from the place where we held them confined:after conquering them we made peace with them: af­terwards, when they were distressed by a war in Africa,we considered them as infilled to our protection. Inreturn for these favors they follow the lead of a hot-brained youth, and come to invade our country. Iwish that on our side this contest was merely forglory, and not for safety. We are not to fight aboutthe possession of Sicily and Sardinia, the subjects ofthe former dispute, but in defence of Italy ; neither isthere another army behind us, which, if we fail toconquer, might withstand the enemy ; nor are thereother Alps, during his passage over which new forcesmight be procured. Here, soldiers, we must make astand, as if we were fighting under the walls of Rome.Let every one persuade himself that he is protectingwith his arms, not only his own person, but his wife,and liis infant children. Nor let him consider solelyhis own domestic concerns, but frequently reflect thatthe senate and people of Rome look for safety at ourhands ; that our strength, and our courage, are now todetermine what will henceforth be the condition ofthat city and of the Roman empire.'

Hannibal, choosing to rouse the cou­rage of his soldiers by the exhibition of facts bef ore hemade use of words, formed his troops in a circle, andthen placed in the middle the prisoners taken on themountains, bound in fetters; when, such arms as areused by the Gauls being thrown at their feet, he or­dered an interpreter to ask whether any of them werewilling, on the condition of being released from bonds,—and, in case of proving victorious, of receiving each

pathless and circuitous ways, which habitual practicerendered easy to them : and now the Carthaginians hadto contend at once with the Gauls and the disadvan­tage of the ground ; and there was a greater struggleamong themselves than with the enemy, for every onestrove to get first out of danger. But the greatest dis­order was occasioned by the horses, which, affrightedat the dissonant clamors, multiplied by the echoes fromthe woods and valleys, became nearly unmanageable ;and when they happened to receive a stroke or awound, grew so unruly as to overthrow numbers ofmen, and heaps of baggage of all sorts ; and as therewere abrupt precipices on each side of the pass, theirviolence cast down many to an immense depth, so that' the fall of such great masses produced a dreadful ef­fect. Although these were shocking sights to Hanni­bal, yet he kept his place for a while, and restrainedthe troops that were with him, lest he should increasethe tumult and confusion. Afterwards, seeing the lineof the army broken, and that there was danger of theirbeing wholly deprived of their baggage, in which casethe effecting of their passage would answer no purpose,he hastened down from the higher ground ; and whileby the mere rapidity of his motion he dispersed theforces of the enemy, he at the same time increased theconfusion among his own. But this, when the roadswere cleared by the flight of the mountaineers, wasinstantly remedied, and the whole army was soonbrought through the pass not only without disturbance,but almost without noise. He then seized a fort,which was the capital of that district, and several vil­lages that lay round it, and fed his army for three dayswith cattle taken from the fugitives. During thesethree days, as he was not incommoded by the moun­taineers, nor much by the nature of the ground, hemade a considerable progress in his march.

The old man, weare told, complied without reluctance, and was carriedin a waggon to the camp, where, when he came tospeak, he made no alteration in the opinions which hehad given, only added the reasons on which he foundedthem. That ' by his first plan, which he esteemed thebest, he meant, by an act of extraordinary kindness, toestablish perpetual peace a,nd friendship with a mostpowerful nation: by the other, to put off the return ofwar to the distance of many ages, during which the Ro­man state, after the loss of those two armies, could noteasily recover its strength. A third plan there wasnot.' His son and the other chiefs then asking him if' a plan of a middle kind might not be adopted ; of dis­missing them unhurt; and, at the same time, by theright of war, imposing terms on them as vanquished?'—' That, indeed,' said he, ' is a plan of such a nature,as neither procures friends nor removes enemies. Onlyconsider who they are, whom you would irritate byignominious treatment. The Romans are a race whoknow not how to sit down quiet under defeat; anyscar, which the present necessity shall imprint in theirbreasts will rankle there for ever, and will not sufferthem to rest until they have wreaked manifold ven­geance on your heads.' Neither of these plans wasapproved, and Herennius was carried home.

In the other camp the Romans, having tried manyfruitless efforts to force a passage, and being now des­titute of every means of subsistence, were reduced bynecessity to send ambassadors, who were first to askpeace on equal terms; which, if they did not obtain,they were to challenge the enemy to battle.

embassy be sent, to make restitution to the Saguntines.'When Hanno had ended his discourse, there was nooccasion for any one to enter into a debate with him,so intirely were almost the whole body of the senate inthe interest of Hannibal, and they blamed him as hav­ing spoken with greater acrimony than even ValeriusFlaccus, the Roman ambassador. They then answeredthe Roman ambassadors that ' the war had been begunby the Saguntines, not by Hannibal; and that the Ro­man people acted unjustly and unwisely, if they pre­ferred the interest of the Saguntines to that of the Car­thaginians, their earliest allies.'
11. While the Romans wasted time in sending em­bassies, Hannibal finding his soldiers fatigued withfighting and labor, gave them a few days to rest, ap­pointing parties to guard the machines and works. Thisinterval he employed in reanimating his men, stimu­lating them at one time with resentment against theenemy, at another, with hope of rewards; but a decla-'ration which he made in open assembly that, on thecapture of the city, the spoil should be given to thesoldiers, inflamed them with such ardor that, to all ap­pearance, if the signal had been given immediately, noforce could have withstood them. The Saguntines, asthey had for some days enjoyed a respite from fighting,neither offering nor sustaining an attack, so they hadnever ceased, either by day or night, to labor hard inraising a new wall, in that part where the city had beenleft exposed by the fall of the old one. After this theoperations of the besiegers were carried on with muchgreater briskness than before ; nor could the besieged -well judgej whilst all places resounded with clamors ofvarious kinds, to what side they should first send suc­cor, or where it was most necessary. Hannibal at­tended in person, to encourage a party of his men whowere bringing forward a movable tower, which ex­ceeded in height all the fortifications of the city.

When thereforeintelligence arrived that reinforcements were to comefrom Tarentum and from the Samnites, all agreed thatthere were more of the latter already within the wallsthan they wished ; but the young men of Tarentum,who were Greeks as well as themselves, they earnestlylonged for, as they hoped to be enabled by their meansto oppose the Samnites and Nolans, which they deemedno less necessary than resisting their Roman enemies.At last a surrender to the Romans appeared to be thelightest evil. Charilaus and Nymphius, the two prin­cipal men in the state, consulting together on the sub­ject, settled the part which each was to act; it was,that one should desert to the Roman general, and theother stay behind to manage affairs in the city, so asto facilitate the execution of their plan. Charilauswas the person who came to Publilius Philo ; he toldhim that ' he had taken a resolution, which he hopedwould prove advantageous, fortunate, and happy to thePalajpolitans, and to the Roman people, of deliveringthe fortifications into his hands. Whether he shouldappear by that deed to have betrayed or preserved hiscountry, depended on the honor of the Romans. Thatfor himself in particular, he neither stipulated nor re­quested any thing; but in behalf of the state, he re­quested rather than stipulated, that in case the designshould succeed, the Roman people would considermore especially the zeal and hazard with which itsought a renewal of their friendship, than its folly andrashness in deviating from its duty.' He was com­mended by the general, and received a body of threethousand soldiers, with which he was to seize on that

The dictatorfound that there would be a necessity for lightingsooner than he had expected; and lest the situationshould be an obstruction to the bravery of the troops,he led away the legions in silence, leaving a great num­ber of fires, the better to deceive the enemy. Thecamps however lay so close together, that he could notescape their observation: their cavalry instantly pur­sued, and pressed closely on his troops, yet refrainedfrom attacking them until the day appeared. Theirinfantry did not even quit their camp before daylight.As soon as it was dawn the cavalry ventured to beginskirmishing; and by harassing the Roman rear, andpressing them in places of difficult passage, consider'ably delayed their march. Meanwhile their infantryovertook their cavalry ; and now the Samnites pursuedclose with their intire force. The dictator, then, find­ing that he could no longer go forward without greatinconvenience, ordered the spot where he stood to bemeasured out for a camp. But it was impossible,while the enemy's horse were spread about on everyside, that palisades could be brought, and the work bebegun: seeing it therefore impracticable, either tomarch forward or to settle himself there, he drew uphis troops for battle, removing the baggage out of theline. The enemy likewise formed their line oppositeto his; nowise inferior, either in spirit or in strength.Their courage was chiefly improved from not knowingthat the motive of the Romans' retreat was the ihcom-modiousness of the ground, so that they imaginedthemselves objects of terror, and supposed that theywere pursuing men who fled through fear. This keptthe balance of the fight equal for a considerable time ;though, of late, it had been unusual with the Samnitesto stand even the shout of a Roman army. Certain itis that the contest, on this day, continued so verydoubtful, from the third hour to the eighth, that nei­ther was the shout repeated, after being raised at the

30. The commanders entered Samnium withouthaving obtained any particularly favorable indicationsin the auspices; an ominous circumstance, whichpointed, not at the event of war, for that was prosper­ous, but at the furious passions and the quarrels whichbroke out between the leaders: for Papirius the dic­tator returning to Rome in order to take the auspicesanew, in consequence of a caution received from thearuspex, left strict orders with the master of the horseto remain in his post, and not to engage in battleduring his absence. After the departure of the dic­tator, Fabius having discovered by his scouts that theenemy were in as unguarded a state as if there wasn'ot a single Roman in their neighborhood, the high-spirited youth, (either conceiving indignation at the soleauthority in'every point appearing to be lodged in thehands of the dictator, or induced by the opportunity ofstriking an important blow,) having made the necessarypreparations and dispositions, marched to a place calledImbrinium, and there fought a battle with the Samnites.His success in the fight was such, that there was noone circumstance which could have been improved tomore advantage if the dictator had been present. Theleader was not wanting to the soldiers, nor the soldiersto their leader. The cavalry too, (finding after re­peated charges that they could not break the ranks,)by the advice of Lucius Cominius, a military tribune,pulled off the bridles from their horses and spurredthem on so furiously that no power could withstandthem : forcing their way through the thickest of theenemy, they bore down every thing before them ; andthe infantry, seconding the charge, -the whole bodywas thrown into confusion.

Seeing so great a multitude collectedround him, he said, 'My intention is to enlist only fourthousand foot, and six hundred horse: such of you asgive in your names to-day and to-morrow I will carrywith me. I am more solicitous to bring home all mysoldiers rich than to employ a great multitude.' Ac­cordingly, with a competent number of men, who pos­sessed greater hopes and confidence, because a nume­rous army had not been required, he marched to thetown of Aharna, from which the enemy were not fardistant, and proceeded to the camp of the pretor Ap-pius. When be came within a few miles of it, he wasmet by some soldiers sent to cut wood, attended by aguard. Observing the lictors preceding him, and learn­ing that he was Fabius the consul, they were filled withjoy; and expressed warm thanks to the gods, and tothe Roman people, for having sent them such a com­mander. Then, as they gathered round to pay theirrespects, Fabius inquired whither they were going ;and on their answering they were going to providewood; 'What do you tell me,' said he; 'have younot a rampart raised about your camp?'—' They had,'they replied, ' a double rampart and a trench ; and,notwithstanding, were in great apprehension.' ' Well,then,' said he, ' you have abundance of wood ; go backand level the rampart.' They accordingly returned tothe camp; and there levelling the rampart, threw thesoldiers who had remained in it, and Appius himself,into the greatest fright, until, with eager joy, eachcalled out to the rest that ' they acted by order of theconsul, Quintus Fabius.' Next day they decamped,and the pretor Appius was dismissed to Rome. Fromthat time the Romans had no fixed post; the consulaffirming that it was prejudicial to an army to lie inone spot; and that by frequent marches, and changingplaces, it was rendered more healthy, and more capa­ble of brisk exertions: and this he practised as long asthe season permitted, tlie winter being not yet ended.Then, in the beginning of spring, leaving the secondlegion near Clusium, which they formerly called the

B.C. 301.] The two Marci,Livius Denter and iEmilius, succeeding to the con­sulship, war broke out again with the iEquaus, who,being highly displeased at the colony established with­in their territory, as if it were a fortress to keep themin awe, made an attempt with their whole force toseize it, but were repulsed by the colonists themselves.They caused however such an alarm at Rome, that toquell this insurrection, Caius Junius Bubulcus wasnominated dictator: for it was scarcely credible thatthe jEquans, after being reduced to such a degree ofweakness, should by themselves alone have venturedto engage in a war. The dictator taking the field withMarcus Titinius, master of the horse, in the first en­gagement, reduced the oEquans to submission; andreturning into the city in triumph on the eighth day,dedicated in the character of dictator the temple ofHealth, which he had vowed when consul, and con­tracted for when censor.
2. During this year a fleet of Grecians, under thecommand of Cleonymus, a Lacedaemonian, arrived onthe coast of Italy, and took Thuriae, a city in the ter­ritory of the Sallentines. Against this enemy the consuljEmilius was sent, who in one battle completely defeatedthem, and without farther opposition drove them onboard their ships. Thuriae was then restored to itsold inhabitants, and peace re-established in the coun­try of the Sallentines. In some annals I find thatJunius Bubulcus was sent dictator into that country,and that Cleonymus, without hazarding an engagementwith the Romans, retired out of Italy. He then sailedround the promontory of Brundusium, and steeringdown the middle of the Adriatic gulf, because hedreaded on the left hand the coasts of Italy destituteof harbors, and on the right the Illyrians, Liburnians,and Istrians, nations of savages, and noted in generalfor piracy, he passed on to the coasts of the Venetians.Here, having landed a small party to explore the

This the cattle some­times penetrated as soon as their feet reached the lowerbed ; and sometimes, when they lost their footing, bystriking more strongly with their hoofs in striving tokeep themselves up, they broke it intirely through ; sothat the greatest part of them, as if caught in traps,stuck fast in the hard and deep ice.
37. At length, after men and beasts were heartilyfatigued to no purpose, they fixed a camp on the sum­mit ; having with very great difficulty cleared even theground which that required, so great was the quantityof snow to be dug and carried off. The soldiers werethen employed to make a way down the steep, throughwhich alone it was possible to effect a passage ; and asit was necessary to break the mass, they felled andlopped a number of huge trees which stood near, whichthey raised into a vast pile, and as soon as a smartwind arose, to forward the kindling of it, set it onfire; and then, when the stone was violently heated,made it crumble to pieces by pouring on vinegar.When the rock was thus disjointed by the power ofthe heat, they opened a way through it with iron in­struments, and inclined the descents in such a manner,that not only the beasts of burden, but even the ele­phants, could be brought down. Four days were spentabout this rock, during which the cattle were nearlydestroyed by hunger; for the summits are for the mostpart bare, and whatever little pasture there might havebeen was covered by the snow. In the lower parts arevalleys and some hills, which, enjoying the benefit of thesun, with rivulets at the side of the woods, are bettersuited to become the residence of human beings.

turning home, the Roman army was immediately with­drawn from thence, after receiving a year's pay for thesoldiers, and corn for three months; which were theconditions stipulated by the consul on his grantingthem a truce until the ambassadors should return.The Samnites marched against the Sidicinians withthe same troops which they had employed in the Ro­man war, sanguine in their expectation of getting im­mediate possession of the enemy's capital. On thisthe Sidicinians proposed, first to the Romans, to putthemselves under their dominion; but the senate re­jected the proposal as made too late, and forced fromthem merely by extreme necessity; then the sameoffer was made to, and accepted by, the Latines, whowere ready to commence hostilities on their own ac­count. Nor did 'even the Campanians refrain fromtaking a part in this quarrel, much stronger impres­sions being left on their minds by the ill treatment re­ceived from the Samnites than by the kindness of theRomans. Out of such a number of nations one vastarmy was composed, under the direction of the La-tines, which, entering the territories of the Samnites,did much greater damage by depredations than byfighting. But although the Latines had the better inthe field, yet they were well pleased to retire out ofthe enemy's country to avoid the necessity of too fre­quent engagements. This respite afforded time to theSamnites to send ambassadors to Rome, who, havingobtained an audience of the senate, made heavy com­plaints that, though now their confederates, they suf­fered the same calamities which they had felt whentheir enemies; and, with the humblest intreaties, re­quested that the Romans would ' think it enough tohave deprived the Samnites of conquest over their ene­mies, the Campanians and Sidicinians; and that theywould not, besides, suffer them to be conquered by sucha union of dastardly nations.

Now, that gods and men may perceivethat they, to avoid a scrutiny as to their own conduct,attempt even impossibilities, and that I willinglymeet the charge, and face the accusations of my ene­mies, I divest myself of the dictatorship. And, con­suls, I beseech you, that if this business is put intoyour hands by the senate, you will make me andMarcus Foslius the first objects of your examinations ;it shall be manifested that we owe our safety from suchimputations to our own innocence, not to the dignityof office.' He then abdicated the dictatorship, as didMarcus Foslius immediately after his office of masterof the horse ; and being the first brought to trial be­fore the consuls, for to them the senate had com­mitted the business, they were most honorably ac­quitted of all the charges brought by the nobles. EvenPublilius Philo, who had so often been invested withthe highest honors, and had performed so many emi­nent services, both at home and abroad, being disa­greeable to the nobility, was brought to trial, and ac­quitted. Nor did the inquiry continue respectable onaccount of the illustrious names of the accused, longerthan while it was new, which is usually the case : itthen began to descend to persons of inferior rank ; andat length was suppressed by means of those factionsand cabals against which it had been instituted.
27. The accounts received of these matters, butmore especially the hope of a revolt in Campania, forwhich a conspiracy had been formed, recalled theSamnites from their intended march towards Apuliaback to Caudium ; where, being near, they might, ifany commotion should open them an opportunity,snatch Capua out of the hands of the Romans. To thesame place the consuls repaired with a powerful army.They both held back for some time, on the different

more steady than theirs. As soon therefore as thesebeheld the Roman standards, a murmur spread fromfront to rear of the Samnites, that, as they had feared,* the Romans were coming out to oppose their march ;that there was no road open through which they couldeven fly thence: in that spot they must fall, or elsecut down the enemy's ranks, and make their way overtheir bodies.'
36. They then threw the baggage in a heap in thecentre, and, with their arms prepared for battle,formed their line, each falling into his post. Therewas now but a small interval between the two armies,and both stood waiting until the shout and onsetshould be begun by their adversary. Neither partyhad any inclination to fight, and they would have sepa­rated and taken different roads without coming to ac­tion, but that each had a dread of being harassed, inretreat by the other. Notwithstanding this reluc­tance, an engagement unavoidably began, but withoutany vigor, and with a shout which discovered neitherresolution nor steadiness ; nor did any move a footfrom his post. The Roman consul, then, in order toipfuse life into the action, ordered a few troops ofcavalry to advance out of the line and charge : most ofwhom being thrown from their horses and the rest putin disorder, several parties ran forward, both from theSamnite line to cut off those who had fallen, and fromthe Roman to protect their friends: this roused somelittle spirit in the combatants; but the Samnites hadcome forward with more briskness and also in greatnumbers, and the disordered cavalry, with their af­frighted horses, trod down their own party who cameto their relief. These were, consequently, the firstwho fled ; and their example was followed by thewhole Roman line. And now the Samnites had noemployment for their arms but against the rear of aflying enemy, when the consul galloping on before hismen to the gate of the camp, posted there a body ofcavalry, with orders to treat as an enemy any personwho should make towards the rampart, whether Roman

should see the troops advance into the water theyshould fall on them: his infantry he formed on thebank, with forty elephants in their front. The Carpe-tans, with the addition of the Olcadians and Vaccaeans,were one hundred thousand in number; an army notto be overcome, if a fight were to take place in an openplain. These being naturally of an impetuous temper,and confiding in their numbers, believing also that theenemy's retreat was owing to fear, and thinking thatthere was no obstruction to their gaining an immediatevictory but the river lying in their way, they raised theshout, and without orders rushed from all parts into it,every one by the shortest way. At the same time avast body of cavalry pushed from the opposite bankinto the river, and the conflict began in the middle ofthe channel, where they fought on very unequal terms:for in such a situation the infantry, not being secure offooting, and scarcely able to bear up against the stream,were liable to be borne down by any shock from thehorse, though the rider were unarmed, and took notrouble; whereas a horseman, having his limbs at li­berty, and his horse moving steadily, even through themidst of the eddies, could act either in close fight or ata distance. Great numbers were swallowed up in thecurrent; while several, whom the eddies of the rivercarried to the Carthaginians' side, were trodden todeath by the elephants. The hindmost, who couldmore safely retreat to their own bank, attempting tocollect themselves into one body from the various partsto which their terror and confusion had dispersed them,Hannibal, not to give them time to recover from theirconsternation, marched into the river with his infantryin close order, and obliged them to fly from the bank.Then, by ravaging their country, he reduced the Car-petans also, in a few days, to submission. And nowall parts of the country beyond the Iberus, except theterritory of Saguntum, was under subjection to theCarthaginians.

It was then winter,and the weather snowy, in Whose places which lie be­tween the Alps and the Apennines; and the cold wasrendered exceedingly intense by the proximity of ri­vers and marshes. Besides this,' both men and horsesbeing drawn out in a hurry, without having first takenfood, or used any precaution to guard against the in-temperature of the air, were quite chilled; and as theyapproached the river, the more piercing were the blastswhich assailed them. But having, in pursuit of theflying' Numidians, entered the river, which, by rain inthe night, was swelled so high as to reach their breasts,their bodies, on coming out, were all so perfectly be­numbed, that they were scarcely capable of holdingtheir arms; and, as the day advanced, they also grewfaint through hunger.
55. Meanwhile Hannibal's soldiers had fires madebefore their tents; oil was distributed to every com­pany to lubricate their joints, and they had at leisurerefreshed themselves with food. As soon therefore asintelligence was brought that the enemy had passedtbe river, they took arms with sprightly vigor both ofmind and body, and thus advanced to battle. Hanni­bal placed in the van the Balearians and light-armedtroops, amounting to about eight thousand; and, in asecond line, his heavier armed infantry, the main powerand strength of his army. The flanks he covered withten thousand cavalry ; and, dividing the elephants,placed half of them on the extremity of each wing.The consul seeing his cavalry, who pressed the pursuitwith disorderly haste, taken at a disadvantage by theNumidians suddenly turning on them, recalled themby the signal for retreat, and posted them on the flanksof the foot.

22. Judging also that Spain ought not to be neglected,in which opinion he was not the less confirmed by hav­ing been acquainted with the tour made through it bythe Roman ambassadors, for the purpose of engagingthe friendship of the chiefs, he allotted that provinceto Hasdrubal his brother, a man of talents and acti­vity ; and he formed his strength mostly of the troopsfrom Africa, giving him eleven thousand eight hundredand fifty African foot, with three hundred Ligurians,and five hundred Balearians. To these bodies of in­fantry were added four hundred and fifty horsemen ofthe Liby-Phoenicians, a race composed of a mixture ofPhoenicians with Africans ; of Numidians and Mauri-tanians, who inhabit the coast of the ocean, to thenumber of oue thousarid eight hundred ; a small bandof the Ilergetans, a Spanish nation, amounting to twohundred horsemen ; and, that he might not be desti­tute of any kind of force which might be useful inoperations on land, fourteen elephants. Also, for thedefence of the sea coast, because, as the Romans hadbeen formerly victorious at sea, it was probable thatthey would now likewise exert themselves in the sameline, a fleet was assigned him of fifty quinqueremes,two quadriremes, and five triremes; but of these onlythirty-two quinqueremes, and the five triremes, werefully equipped and manned with rowers.

To the Tusculans the rightsof citizens, of which they were already in possession,were continued ; and the guilt of the rebellion, insteadof being imputed to disaffection in the state, was thrownon a few incendiaries. On the Veliternians, who wereRoman citizens of an old standing, in resentment oftheir having so often arisen in rebellion, severe ven­geance was inflicted : their walls were rased, and theirsenate driven into banishment; they were also enjoinedto dwell on the farther side of the Tiber, with a denun­ciation that if any of them should be caught on thehither side of that river, the fine to be paid for his dis­charge should be no less than one thousand asses,1 andthat the person apprehending him should not releasehim from confinement until the money should be paid.Into the lands which had belonged to their senatorscolonists were sent, from the addition of whose num­bers Velitraa recovered the appearance of its formerpopulousness. To Antium, also, a new colony wassent, permission being granted at the same time to theAntians of having themselves inrolled therein if theychose it. The ships of war were taken from them, audthe people wholly interdicted from meddling with ma­ritime affairs; but the rights of citizens were granted
corporate towns, where the people retained their own lawsand magistrates, and even honored with the title, and someof them with all the rights and privileges of Roman citizens.The people of Caere were the first who were thus indulgedwith full rights; but afterwards, having joined some neigh­boring states in a war against Rome, all the privileges of ci­tizens were taken from them, and the title only left. In othercountries they planted colonies of their own citizens; bywhich means they disburdened the city of numbers of uselessand poor inhabitants, and at the same time formed barriersagainst the adjoining states.

Still I do not deny, conscript fathers,that compacts on sureties given are as sacred as trea­ties in the eyes of all who regard faith between menwith the same reverence which is paid to duties re­specting the gods : but I insist that without the orderof the people nothing can be ratified that is to bindthe people. Suppose that out of the same arrogancewith which the Samnites forced from us the conventionin question, they had compelled us to repeat the esta­blished form of words for the surrendering of cities,would you, tribunes, say that the Roman people hadsurrendered ? and that this city, these temples andconsecrated grounds, these lands and waters, were be­come the property of the Samnites? I say no more ofthe surrender, because our having become sureties isthe point insisted on. Now suppose we had becomesureties, that the Roman people should quit this city;that they should set it on fire ; that they should haveno magistrates, no senate, no laws ; that they shouldin future be ruled by kings : the gods forbid, you say.But the enormity of the articles lessens not the obliga­tion of a compact. If the people can be bound in anyone instance, it can in all. Nor is there any impor­tance in another circumstance, which weighs, perhaps,with some: whether a consul, a dictator, or a pretor,be the surety.

This ap­peared most evidently, in that wherever he was carriedby his horse, there they were seized with a panic, asif struck by some pestilent constellation: but wherehe fell, overwhelmed with darts, manifest consternationtook, possession of the cohorts of the Latines, so thatthey fled from the spot, leaving it void to a consider­able extent. At the same time the Romans, theirminds being delivered from the dread of the gods,exerted themselves with fresh ardor, as if they werethen rushing to the first onset, on receiving the signal.Then even the rorarii pushed forward among the an-tepilani, and added strength to the spearmen andprincipes ; and the veterans, resting on their right knee,waited for the consul's nod to rise up to the fight.

The consul Manlius, whohad heard the circumstances of his colleague's death,and, as was justly due to him, expressed his sentimentsof the glorious manner in which he died, both by tearsand by the praises to which it was intitled, hesitated awhile whether it were yet time for the veterans torise : then, judging it better to reserve them fresh forthe decisive blow, he ordered the accensi to advancefrom the rear, before the standards. On their movingforward, the Latines immediately called their veterans,thinking their adversaries had done the same; andwhen these by fighting furiously for a considerabletime had fatigued themselves, and either broken offthe points of their, spears, or blunted them, yet con­tinuing to drive, back..their opponents, thinking thatthe fate of the battle was nearly decided, and that theyhad come to the last line, then the consul called to theveterans, ' Now arise, fresh as you are, against menwho are fatigued, and think on your country, your

It is said that his only attendantwas a slave, who had been bred up with him, and whowas therefore not ignorant of the same language. Theyreceived no farther instructions at their departurethan a summary description of the country throughwhich they were to pass ; to this was added the namesof the principal men in the several states, to preventtheir being at a loss in conversation, and from beingdiscovered by making some mistake. They set out inthe dress of shepherds, armed with rustic weapons,bills, and two short javelins each. But though theirspeaking the language of the country, with the fashionof their dress and arms, be supposed to have concealedthem, it was more effectually done by the incrediblecircumstance of a stranger's passing the Cimiuianforest. They are said to have penetrated as far as theCamertian district of the Umbrians : there the Romansventured to own who they were, and being introducedto the senate, treated with them, in the name of theconsul, about an alliance and friendship ; and afterbeing entertained with courteous hospitality, were de­sired to acquaint the Romans, that if they came intothose countries, there should be provisions in readi­ness for the troops sufficient for thirty days, and thatthey should find the youth of the Camertian Umbriansprepared in arms to obey their commands. When thisinformation was brought to the consul, he sent forwardthe baggage at the first watch, ordering the legions tomarch in the rear of it.

by this stubborn answer the adversaries of the causeof the Privernians were the more exasperated againstthem, and wishing, by a question of favorable import,to draw from him a more conciliating reply, said tohim, ' What if we remit the punishment, in what man­ner may we expect that you will observe the peacewhich shall be established between us?' He replied,' If the peace which you grant us be a good one, invio­lably and eternally; if bad, for no long continuance.'On this several exclaimed that the Privernian menacedthem, and not in-ambiguous terms; and that such ex­pressions were calculated to excite rebellion. But themore reasonable part of the senate interpreted his an­swers more favorably, and said that ' the words whichthey had beard were those of a man, and of one whoknew what it was to be free. Could it be believed thatany people, or even any individual, would remainlonger than necessity constrained in a situation whichhe felt painful ? that the terms of a peace were faith­fully observed only when they were voluntarily ac­cepted ; but that it was absurd to expect fidelity whenattempts were made to establish slavery.' In this opi­nion they were led to concur, principally by the consulhimself, who frequently observed to the consulars, whohad proposed the different resolutions, in such a manneras to be heard by the rest, that ' surely those men whothought of nothing but liberty were worthy of beingmade Romans.' They consequently carried their causein the senate : and moreover, by direction of that body,a proposal was laid before the people that the freedomof the state should be granted to the Privernians.This year a colony of three hundred was sent to Anxur,and received two acres of land each.
22. The year following, [A.U. C. 427. B.C. 325] inwhich the consuls were Publius Plautius Proculus andPublius Cornelius Scapula, was remarkable for no onetransaction, civil or military, except the sending of acolony to Fregellae, a district which had belonged tothe Sidicinians, and afterwards to the Volscians; anda distribution of meat to the people, made by Marcus

fell into the hands of the soldiers. This they were ob­liged to sell in like manner as the former; and thoughno rest was allowed them, they proceeded, never­theless, with the utmost alacrity to Ferentinum. Buthere they met a greater share both of difficulty anddanger: the garrison made a vigorous defence, andthe place was strongly fortified both by nature and art.However, the soldiers, now inured to plunder, over­came every obstacle. Three thousand of the enemywere killed round the walls, and the spoil was given tothe troops. In some annals the principal share of thehonor of taking these cities is attributed to Maximus.They say that Murgantia was taken by Decius; Ro-mulea and Ferentinum by Fabius. Some ascribe thishonor to the new consuls: others not to both, but toone of these—Lucius Volumnius, whose province theysay Samnium was.
18. While things went on thus in Samnium, andwhoever it was that had the command and auspices,another powerful combination, composed of manystates, was formed in Etruria against the Romans, thechief promoter of which was Gellius Egnatius, a Sam-nite. Almost all the Etrurians had united in this hos­tile design. The neighboring states of Umbria weredrawn in, as it were, by contagion ; and auxiliarieswere procured from the Gauls for hire: all their seve­ral numbers assembled at the camp of the Samnites.When intelligence of this sudden commotion was re­ceived at Rome, the consul, Lucius Volumnius, hadalready set out for Samnium, with the second andthird legions, and fifteen thousand of the allies ; itwas therefore resolved that Appius Claudius should,without loss of time, go into Etruria. He took withhim two Roman legions, the first and fourth, andtwelve thousand allies, and encamped at a small dis­tance from the enemy. However, his early arrival,though productive of one good effect, the restraining,by dread of the Roman name, several states of Etru­ria who were inclined to war, yet was not followed byany very judicious or successful enterprise.

Hannibal being wounded, and retiring from the fight,his men became dispirited ; and the defence of thefortress was effectually maintained. After this, takingbut a few days to rest, and scarcely allowing time forhis wound to be thoroughly healed, he set out to laysiege to Victumviae. This had been fortified by theRomans for a magazine in the time of the Gallic war.Afterwards numbers of people, from all the neighbor­ing states, fixing their residence round it, made it apopulous place; and, at this juncture, fear of the ene­my's depredations had driven into it the greater partof the country people. The multitude thus composed,being excited to a warmth of courage by the report ofthe gallant defence made by the garrison near Placen-tia, snatched up arms, and marched out to meet Han­nibal. The parties engaged on the road, in the orderof march rather than of battle; and as there was onone side nothing more than a disorderly crowd, on theother a leader confident of his soldiers, and a soldieryconfident of their leader, a number not less than thirty-five thousand was routed by a small party. Next daythey capitulated, and received a garrison within theirwalls. They were then ordered to deliver up theirarms, with which they had no sooner complied than asignal was suddenly given to the conquerors to sackthe city, as if taken by storm. Nor have writers,in cases of the like nature, mentioned any one cala­mity which was not suffered on this occasion: everyoutrage which lust, cruelty, and inhuman insolencecould dictate, being practised on those wretched peo­ple. Such were Hannibal's enterprises during thewinter.
58. After this he gave rest to his troops, but not forany great length of time, only while the cold was into­lerable. On the first and even uncertain appearancesof spring, he left his winter quarters, and marchedtowards Etruria ; determined, either by force or per­suasion, to prevail on that nation to join him, as hehad already managed the Gauls and Ligurians.

made to punish them by force of arms, resentment anddread of immediate danger might produce the sameeffect. And the whole body of Vestinians, too, was atleast equal in strength to the Samnites, being com­posed of the Marsians, the Pelignians, and the Mar-rusinians ; against all of whom they would have tocontend if any steps were taken against that nation.However, that opinion prevailed, which might at thetime seem to have more spirit than prudence ; but theevent afforded a proof that fortune assists the brave.The people, in pursuance of the direction of the senate,ordered war against the Vestinians, which provincefell by lot to Junius ; Samnium to Camillus. Armieswere led to both places, which by carefully guardingthe frontiers, prevented a junction of the forces of theirenemies. But Lucius Furius, on whom the principalweight of the business rested, was deprived of hisshare in the management of it, being seized with asevere sickness. He was therefore ordered to nomi­nate a dictator to conduct the war, and he nominatedLucius Papirius Cursor, the most celebrated general,by far, of any in that age, who appointed Quintus Fa-bius Maximus Rullianus master of the horse. Thesecommanders were remarkable for their exploits in war ;but more so for a quarrel which arose between them­selves, and which proceeded almost to violence. Theother consul in the territory of the Vestinians carriedon operations of various kinds; and in all was uni­formly successful. He utterly laid waste their lands,and by spoiling and burning their houses and corn,compelled them to come to an engagement; when, inone battle, he reduced the strength of the Vestiniansto such a degree, though not without loss on his ownside, that they not only fled to their camp, but fear­ing even to trust to the rampart and trench, dis­persed from thence into the several towns, in hopes oftmding security in the situation and fortifications oftheir cities. At last he undertook to reduce theirtowns by force ; and so ardent were the soldiers, andsuch their resentment for the wounds which they hadMV. V0L- D

sides of the defiles, the roads being dangerous to eitherparty. Then the Samnites, making a short circuitthrough an open tract, marched down their troops intolevel ground in the Campanian plains, and there thehostile camps first came within view of each other.Both armies then made trial of their strength in slightskirmishes, more frequently between the horse thanthe foot; and the Romans were no way displeasedeither at the issue of these, or at the protraction ofthe war. The Samnite generals, on the contrary, wereuneasy that their battalions should be weakened dailyby small losses, and the general vigor abated by inac­tion. They therefore marched into the field, disposingtheir cavalry on both wings, with orders to give moreheedful attention to the camp behind than to the bat­tle ; for that the line of infantry would be able to pro­vide for their own safety. The consuls took post, Sul-picius on the right wing, Petilius in the left. Theright wing was stretched out wider than usual; theSamnites also on that side being formed in thin ranks,either with design of turning the flank of the enemy,or to avoid being themselves surrounded. On the left,besides that they were formed in more compact order,an addition was made to their strength by a suddenact of the consul Petilius: for the subsidiary cohorts,which were usually reserved for the exigences of atedious fight, he brought up immediately to the front,'and, in the first onset, pushed the enemy with thewhole of his force. The Samnite line of infantry givingway, their cavalry advanced to support them ; and, asthey were charging in an oblique direction betweenthe two lines, the Roman horse coming up at fullspeed, disordered their battalions and ranks of infantryand cavalry, so as to oblige the whole line on that sideto give ground. The left wing bad not only the pre­sence of Petilius to animate them, but that of Sulpi-cius likewise ; who, on the shout being first raised inthat quarter, rode thither from his own division, whichhad not yet engaged.

prudent, lest, while be procrastinated, some unforeseenevent might disconcert his design, as had been the caseof his father Hamilcar, and afterwards of Hasdrobal,he determined to make war on the Saguntines: and,as an attack, on them would certainly call forth theRoman arms, be first led his army into the territory ofthe Olcadians, a nation beyond the Iberus; which,though within the boundaries of the Carthaginians,was not under their dominion, in order that he mightnot seem to have aimed directly at the Saguntines, butto be drawn on into a war with them by a series ofevents, and by advancing progressively, after the con­quest of the adjoining nations, from one place to thenext contiguous. Here he took and plundered Althea,the capital of the nation, abounding in wealth; andthis struck such terror into the smaller cities that theysubmitted to bis authority, and to the imposition of atribute. He then led his army, flushed with a victoryand enriched with spoil, into winter-quarters at NewCarthage. Here, by a liberal distribution of the booty,and by discharging punctually the arrears of pay, hefirmly secured the attachment both of his own country­men and of the allies; and, at the opening of the spring,carried forward his arms against the Vaccaeans, fromwhom he took by storm the cities Hermandica andArbacala. Arbacala, by the bravery and number ofits inhabitants, was enabled to make a long defence.Those who escaped from Hermandica, joining the ex­iles of the Olcadians, the nation subdued in the prece­ding summer, roused up the Carpetans to arms, andattacking Hannibal as he was returning from the coun­try of the Vaccaeans, not far from the river Tagus,caused a good deal of disorder among his troops, in­cumbered as they were with spoil. Hannibal avoidedfighting, and encamped on the bank; then, as soon asthe enemy afforded him an opportunity, he crossed theriver by a ford, and carried his rampart to such a dis­tance from its edge as to leave room for the enemy topass over, resolving to attack them in their passage.He gave orders to his cavalry, that as soon as they

wards as a warning to others not to refuse it. Whenthose of the first rank in the Sammte nation had beenbound under these solemnities, the general nominatedten, whom he desired to choose each a man, and so toproceed until they should have filled up the number ofsixteen thousand. This body, from the covering of theinclosure wherein the nobility had been thus devoted,was called the linenlegion. They were furnished withsplendid armor, and plumed helmets, to distinguishthem above the rest. They had another body of forces,amounting to somewhat more than twenty thousand,not inferior to the linen legion, either in personal ap­pearance, or renown in war, or their equipment forservice. This number, composing the main strength ofthe nation, sat down at Aquilonia.
39. On the other side, the consuls set out from thecity. First, Spurius Carvilius, to whom had been de­creed the veteran legions, which Marcus Atilius, theconsul of the preceding year, had left in' the territoryof Interamna, marched at their head into Samnium ;and, while the enemy were busied in their superstitiousrites, and holding their secret meeting, he took bystorm the town of Amiternum. Here were slain abouttwo thousand eight hundred men ; and four thousandtwo hundred and seventy were made prisoners. Pa-pirius, with a new army, which he raised in pursuanceof a decree of the senate, made himself master of thecity of Duronia. He took fewer prisoners than hiscolleague; but slew much greater numbers. Richbooty was acquired in both places. The consuls then,overrunning Samnium, and wasting the province ofAtinum with particular severity, arrived, Carvilius atdominium, and Papirius at Aquilonia, where the mainforce of the Samnites was posted. Here, for some time,there was neither a cessation of action, nor any vigor­ous effort. The day was generally spent in provokingthe enemy when quiet, and retiring when they offeredresistance ; in menacing, rather than making an attack.By which practice of beginning, and then desisting,even those trifling skirmishes were continually left

for carrying over the men, horses, and other weighty-matters. As to the Spaniards, they took no troubleabout any means of conveyance, but thrusting theirclothes into leathern bags, and resting their bodies ontheir bucklers placed under them, swam over the river.The rest of the troops, having also passed over on therafts joined together, they encamped near the river,and being fatigued by the march during the night, andby the labor of the work, refreshed themselves withrest for one day, while their leader was earnestly stu­dying how to execute the design in proper season.Next day, having marched from thence, they made asignal, by raising a smoke, that they had effected theirpassage, and were not far distant; which being per­ceived by Hannibal, he gave the signal for his troopsto pass the river. The infantry had the boats equippedand in readiness, and a line of larger vessels, with thehorsemen, most of whom had their horses swimmingnear them, crossed higher up the river, in order tobreak the force of the current, and thereby render thewater smooth for the boats passing below. The horsesfor the most part were led after the sterns by collars,those only excepted which had been put on board theships bridled and accoutred, in order that the riders,on their landing, might have them ready for instantuse.
28. The Gauls ran down to the bank to meet them,with various kinds of cries and songs, according to theircustom, tossing their shields above their heads, and withtheir right hands brandishing their javelins, notwith­standing the terrible appearance of such a vast numberof ships, together with the loud roaring of the river,and the confused clamors of the mariners and soldiers,both of those who were struggling to force their waythrough the violent current, and of those who, from theopposite bank, encouraged their friends on their pas­sage. While they saw sufficient cause of terror on theirfront, a more terrifying shout assailed them from behind,where their camp was taken by Hanno.

if it be true, as I find in some annals, that Pontius, sonof Herennius, the Samnite general, was sent under theyoke along with the rest, to atone for the disgrace ofthe consuls. I think it indeed less strange to find un­certainty, with respect to the treatment of the Samnitegeneral, than that there should be a doubt whether itwas Lucius Cornelius, in quality of dictator, (LuciusPapirius Cursor being master of the horse, who actedat Caudium, and afterwards at Luceria, as the singleavenger of the disgrace of the Romans, enjoying thebest deserved triumph, perhaps next to that of FuriusCamillus, which had ever yet been obtained,) or whe­ther that honor belongs to the consuls, and particularlyto Papirius. This uncertainty is followed by another,whether at the next election [A.U.C. 435. B.C. 317]Papirius Cursor was chosen consul a third time, withQuintus Aulus Cerretanus a second time, being re­elected in requital pf his services at Luceria; or whe­ther it was Lucius Papirius Mugillanus, the surnamebeing mistaken.
16. From henceforth the accounts are clear that theother wars were conducted to a conclusion by the con­suls. Aulius, by one successful battle, intirely con­quered the Ferentans. The city, to which their armyhad retreated after its defeat, surrendered on terms,and was ordered to give hostages. Similar fortune at­tended the other consul in his operations against theSatricans ; who, though Roman citizens, had, after themisfortune at Caudium, revolted to the Samnites, andreceived a garrison into their city. The Satricans,however, when the Roman army approached theirwalls, sent deputies to sue for peace, with humble in -treaties, to whom the consul answered harshly, that 'theymust not come again to him, unless they either putto death, or delivered up the Samnite garrison :' whichwords struck greater terror into the colonists than thearms with which they were threatened. The deputies,on this, several times asking the consul how he thoughtthat they, who were few and weak, could attempt touse force against a garrison so strong and well armed,

the senate should, previous to the taking of the suf­frages, declare their approbation of all laws whichshould be passed in the assemblies of the centuries ;the third, that one of the censors should, necessarily,be elected out of the commons, as it had been alreadyestablished that both the consuls might be plebeians.In the judgment of the patricians, the detriment sus­tained that year, at home, from the behavior of theconsuls and dictator, was more than a counterbalanceto the increase of empire through their conduct andsuccesses in war.
13. At the commencement of the nextyear, [A.U.C.417. B.C. 335] in which Lucius Furius Camillus andCaius Maenius were consuls, the senate, in order torender more conspicuous the conduct of jEmilius, inrelinquishing the business of the campaign, warmlyurged that men, arms, and every kind of force, shouldbe employed to take Pedum, and demolish it. Thenew consuls were of course obliged to postpone everyother business, and to set out thither. In Latium thestate of affairs was such that the people could ill en­dure either war or peace ; their strength was notequal to the support of a war, and peace they dis­dained on the humiliating terms of losing their lands.They resolved therefore to steer a middle course ; tokeep within the walls of their towns, so that no pro­vocation should be offered to the Romans which mightserve them as a pretext for hostilities ; and in casethey should hear of siege being laid to any of theirpossessions, then, that every one of the estates shouldbe obliged to bring succor .to the besieged. Pedumhowever received aid from few ; the Tiburtians andPraenestians, whose territories lay nearest, arrivedthere: but the Aricians, Lavinians, and Veliternians,while forming a junction with the Volscians of Anti-um at the river Astura, were unexpectedly attackedby Maenius, and routed. The Tiburtians, who weremuch the strongest body, Camillus fought at Pedum ;and, though he had greater difficulties to surmount,yet the issue was equally successful. Some confusion

that all the rest would be plain and smooth; and afterone, or at most a second battle, they would have thebulwark and capital of Italy in their power and dispo­sal.' The army then began to advance, the enemynow desisting from any farther attempts on them, ex­cept by trifling parties for pillaging, as opportunityoffered. But the way was much more difficult than ithad been in the ascent; the declivity on the Italianside of the Alps being in most places shorter, and con­sequently more perpendicular; while the whole waywas narrow and slippery, so that the soldiers could notprevent their feet from sliding, nor, if they made theleast false step, could they, on falling, stop themselvesin the place: and thus men and beasts tumbled pro­miscuously over one another.
36. They then came to a ridge much narrower thanthe others, and composed of rock so upright, that alight-armed soldier, making the trial, could with muchdifficulty, by laying hold of bushes and roots, whichappeared here and there, accomplish the descent. Inthis place the precipice, originally great, had by alate falling away of the earth been increased to thedepth of at least one thousand feet. Here the cavalrystopped, as if at the end of their journey, and Hanni­bal, wondering what could be the cause of the troopshalting, was told that the cliff was impassable. Thengoing up himself to view the place, it seemed clear tohim that he must lead his army in a circuit, thoughever so great, and through tracts never trodden before.That way, however, was found to be impracticable.The old snow indeed had become hard, and being co­vered with the new of a moderate depth, the menfound good footing as they walked through it; butwhen that was dissolved by the treading of so manymen and beasts, they then trod on the naked ice be­low. Here they were much impeded, because the footcould take no hold on the smooth ice, and was besidesthe more apt to slip, on account of the declivity of theground; and whenever they attempted to rise, either

his colleague, and keeping himself disengaged, hethrew every difficulty in the way of the enemy's con­voys. There heing therefore little hope for the be­sieged, or that they would be able much longer to en­dure want, the Samnites, encamped at Luceria, wereobliged to collect their forces from every side, andcome to an engagement with Papirius.
14. At this juncture, while both parties were pre­paring for an action, ambassadors from the Tarentinesinterposed, requiring both Samnites and Romans todesist from war; with menaces, that ' if either refused toagree to a cessation of hostilities, they would join theirarms with the other party, against them.' Papirius,on hearing the purport of their embassy, as if theirwords had made some impression on him, answered,that he would consult his colleague: he then sent forhim, employing the intermediate time in the neces­sary preparations; and when he had conferred withhim on a matter, on which they were at no loss how todetermine, he made the signal for battle. While theconsuls were employed in performing the religiousrites, and the other usual business preparatory to anengagement, the Tarentine ambassadors put them­selves in their way, expecting an answer: to whomPapirius said, ' Tarentines, the priest reports that theauspices are favorable, and that our sacrifices havebeen attended with excellent omens : under the direc­tion of the gods we are proceeding, as you see, to ac­tion.' He then ordered the standards to move, and ledout the troops ; thus rebuking the exorbitant arroganceof that nation, which at a time when, through intestinediscord and sedition, it was unequal to the manage­ment of its own affairs, yet presumed to prescribe thebounds of peace and war to others. On the other side,the Samnites, who had neglected every preparationfor fighting, either because they were really desirousof peace, or found it their interest to pretend to he so,in order to conciliate the favor of the Tarentines, whenthey saw, on a sudden, the Romans drawn up for battle,cried out that ' they would continue to be directed by

Let himhave a right to devote his arms to Vulcan, or to anyother god, he shall do it, either by a victim, or in anyother mode. The enemy should, if possible, be hin­dered from getting possession of the weapon on whichthe consul stood when he uttered his imprecation : butif they chance to attain it, an atonement must be madeto Mars by the sacrifices called Suovetaurilia.' Al­though the memory of every divine and human ritehas been obliterated through the preference given towhat is new and foreign, above that which is ancientand the growth of our own country, yet I thought itnot amiss to recite these particulars as they have beentransmitted to us, and even in the very words in whichthey were expressed.
11. Several authors relate that the Samnites, havingwaited to see the issue of the fight, came up, at length,with support to the Romans, after the battle wasended. In like manner a reinforcement from Lavi-nium, after wasting time in deliberation, set out to theaid of the Latines, after they had been vanquished ;and when the first standards and part of the army hadpassed the gates, receiving information of the over­throw of the Latines, they faced about and returned tothe city ; on which their pretor, named Millionius, isreported to have said, that ' a high price must be paidto the Romans for so short a journey.' Such of theLatines as survived the fight, after being scatteredthrough different roads, collected themselves in abody and took refuge in the city of Vescia. Theretheir general Numisius insisted,.in their meetings,that ' the variable chances of war had ruined botharmies, by equal losses, and that the name only of vic­tory was on the side of the Romans; and that theywere, in fact, no better than defeated.

tervals between them. A company had twenty light-armed soldiers, the rest bearing shields ; those werecalled light, who carried only a spear and short ironjavelins. This body, which formed the van in the fieldof battle, contained the youth in early bloom, whowere advancing to the age of service ; next to themfollowed the men of more robust age, in the samenumber of companies, whom they called principes, allbearing shields, and distinguished by the completestarmor. This band of twenty companies they calledantepilani, because there were, at the same time, tenothers placed behind them with the standards. Ofthese companies, each was distinguished into threedivisions, and the first division of each they called apilus. Each company had three ensigns, and con­tained one hundred and eighty-six men. The firstensign was at the head of the triarii, veteran soldiersof approved courage ; the second, at the head of therorarii, men whose age and course of service affordedless ability ; the third, at that of the accensi, the bodyin whom they placed the least confidence of all, forwhich reason also they were thrown back to the lastline. An army being marshalled according to thisdisposition, the spearmen first began the fight: if thesewere unable to repulse the enemy, they retreated lei­surely, and the principes received them into the in­tervals of their ranks. The fight then rested on theprincipes, the spearmen following in their rear. Theveterans continued kneeling behind the ensigns withtheir left leg extended forward, holding their shieldsresting on their shoulders, and their spears fixed inthe ground, with the points erect; so that their linepresented an appearance of strength, like that of arampart. If the principes also failed in making animpression on the enemy, they fell back slowly fromthe front to the veterans.

It shall be seen whe­ther you will submit to an appeal, to which TullusHostilius, a Roman king, submitted.' They proceededdirectly from the senate-house to the assembly; where,having arrived, the dictator attended by few, the mas­ter of the horse by all the people of the first rank in abody, Papirius commanded him to be taken from therostrum to the lower ground; on which his father,following him, said, ' You do well in ordering as tobe brought down to a place where even as private per­sons we have liberty of speech.' At first, instead ofregular speeches, nothing but altercation was beard: 'at length, the indignation of old Fabius, and thestrength of his voice, got the better of noise, while hereproached Papirius with arrogance and cruelty. 'Hehimself,' he said, ' had been dictator at Rome ; and noman, not even the lowest plebeian, or centurion, orsoldier, had suffered in any way through his means. ButPapirius sought for victory and triumph over a Ro­man commander with as much zeal as over the gene­rals of the enemy.

Quintius Cincinnatus, when dic­tator, showed no farther mark of resentment to LuciusMinucius the consul, (although from his ill conduct hehad fallen into the power of the enemy, and fromwhich he rescued him,) than leaving him at the headof the army, in the quality of lieutenant-general, in­stead of consul.

Neverdid either the foot soldier or horseman feel militaryservice more laborious, under any general, because hewas of a constitution not to be overcome by fatigue.The cavalry, on some occasion, venturing to requestthat, in consideration of their good behavior, he wouldexcuse them some part of their business, he told them,' you should not say that no indulgence has beengranted you :—I excuse you from rubbing your horses'backs when you dismount.' He supported also the au­thority of command, in all its vigor, both among theallies and his countrymen. The pretor of Praeneste,through fear, had been tardy in bringing forward hismen from the reserve to the front: the general walkingbefore his tent, ordered him to be called, and then badethe lictor to make ready his axe ; on which the Prae-nestine, standing frightened almost to death, he said,' here, lictor, cut away this stump, it is troublesome topeople as they walk;' and, after thus alarming himwith the dread of the severest punishment, fined anddismissed him. It is beyond doubt, that during thatage, than which none was ever more productive ofvirtuous characters, there was no m^u in whom theRoman affairs found a more effectual support: nay,people even marked him out in their minds as a matchfor Alexander the Great, in case that having completedthe conquest of Asia, he should have turned his armson Europe.

hundred men, but found affairs on that side in a verydifferent posture; the Romans driven from theirground, and the victorious enemy pressing on theirdisordered battalions. However, the arrival of theconsul effected a speedy change in every particular ;for, on the sight of their leader, the spirit of the sol­diers was revived, and the bravery of the men whocame with him rendered them a more powerful rein­forcement than even their number; while the news ofsuccess in the other wing, of which they soon had visi­ble proof, restored the vigor of the fight. From thistime the Romans became victorious through the wholeextent of the line, and the Samnites, giving up thecontest, were slain or taken prisoners, except such asmade their escape to Maleventum, the town which isnow called Beneventum. Thirty thousand of theSamnites were slain or taken, according to accountsof historians.

The consuls, after this important victory, ledforward the legions to lay siege to Bovianum; andthere they continued during part of the winter, untilCains Petilius being nominated dictator, with MarcusFoslius master of the horse, received the command ofthe army from the new consuls, Lucius Papirius Cursora fifth, and Caius Junius Bubulcus a second time.[A.U.C. 441.

Within thewalls of this place the whole multitude of the Sam­nites, and the inhabitants of the country about Nola,shut themselves up on the approach of the dictator.Having taken a view of the situation of the city, inorder to open the approach to the fortifications, he setfire to all the buildings which stood round the walls,which were very numerous; and, in a short time after,Nola was taken, either by the dictator Petilius, or the

Lilybaeum and all the maritime states were exposed toimminent danger, he informed him that there weremany to whom a revolution would be highly agreeable:for these reasons the consul judged that he ought with­out making any delay, to sail on directly to Lilybaeum,whither he was accompanied by the king and his fleet.On their passage they received the news of the fight ofLilybaeum, of the discomfiture of the enemy, and thecapture of their ships.
. 51. From Lilybaeum the consul, after dismissingking Hiero with his fleet, and leaving the pretor todefend the coast of Sicily, sailed over to the island ofMelita, which was in the possession of the Carthagi­nians. Immediately on his arrival, Hamilcar, son ofGisgo, commander of the garrison, and somewhat lessthan two thousand soldiers, together with the townand the island, were surrendered into his hands. Fromthence he returned in a few days to Lilybaeum, whereall the prisoners taken by the consul, and by the pre­tor, except those who were of distinguished birth,were sold by public auction. When the consul thoughtthat side of Sicily sufficiently secured, he sailed overto the islands of Vulcan, because there was a reportthat the Carthaginian fleet lay there ; but he met withnone at those islands, for it happened that they hadalready passed over to ravage the coast of Italy, and,after laying waste the territory of Vibo, were nowthreatening that city. When he was on his return toSicily, he was informed of the descent made by theenemy on the territory of Vibo. Letters were at thesame time delivered to him from the senate, containingan account of Hannibal's having entered Italy, andalso orders to come to the support of his colleaguewith all possible expedition. So many objects de­manding his attention at once, he instantly embarkedhis troops, and sent them by the upper sea to Arimi-num ; appointed Sextus Pomponius, lieutenant-gene­ral, with twenty ships of war, to defend the territoryof Vibo and the sea-coast of Italy; made up a fleet

in the war in Samnium, under the proconsul LuciusVolumnius. The first encounter was supported, withstrength so equal on both sides, that had the Etruriansand Umbrians been present at the action, either in thefield or at the camp, in whichever place they mighthave employed their force, the Romans must have beendefeated.
28. However, although the victory was still unde­cided, Fortune not having declared in favor of eitherparty, yet the course of the fight was by no meanssimilar on both right and left wings. The Romans,under Fabius, rather repelled than offered assault; andthe contest was protracted until very late in the day;for their general knew very well that both Samnitesand Gauls were furious in the first onset; so that, toprevent their progress, was as much as could well beeffected. It was known, too, that in a longer disputethe spirits of the Samnites gradually flagged, and eventhe bodies of the Gauls, remarkably ill able to bearlabor and heat, became quite relaxed; and although intheir first efforts they were more than men, yet in their-last they were less than women. He therefore re­served the strength of his men, for the aforesaid rea­sons, until the time when the enemy were the morelikely to be worsted. Decius, more impetuous, asbeing in the prime of life and full flow of spirits, ex­erted his whole force to the utmost in the first encoun-«ter; and thinking the infantry not sufficiently power­ful, brought up the cavalry to their aid. Putting him­self at the head of a troop of young horsemen of distin­guished bravery, he besought those youths, the flowerof the army, to follow him, and charge the enemy :telling them ' they would reap a double share of gloryif the victory should commence on the left wing, andthrough their means.' Twice they compelled the Gal­lic cavalry to give way. At the second charge theyadvanced nearer, and were briskly engaged in themidst of the enemy's squadrons, when, by a method offighting to which they were utter strangers, they werethrowp into dismay.

soldiers, crowding to the general's quarters, demandedfrom their leaders that succor, which it was hardly inthe power of the immortal gods themselves to affordthem.
3. Night came on while they were employed in la­menting their situation, all urging with warmth what­ever their several tempers prompted. Some cryingout, ' Let us go over those fences which ohstruct theroads;' others, ' over the steeps; through the woods;any way where arms can be carried. Let us be butpermitted to come to the enemy, whom we have beenused to conquer now near thirty years. All places willbe level and plain to a Roman fighting against the per­fidious Samnite.' Another would say, ' Whither, or bywhat way can we go? Do we expect to remove themountains from their foundations? While these cliffshang over us, how can we proceed? Whether armedor unarmed, brave or dastardly, we are all, without dis­tinction, captured and vanquished. The enemy will noteven show us a weapon by which we might die withhonor. He will finish the war without moving fromhis seat.' In such discourse, thinking of neither foodnor rest, they passed the whole night. Nor could theSamnites, though in circumstances so accordant to theirwishes, instantly determine how to act: it was thereforeuniversally agreed that Herennius Pontius, father of thegeneral, should be consulted by letter. He was nowgrown feeble through age, and had withdrawn himself,not only from all military, but also from all civil occu­pations ; yet, notwithstanding the decline of his bodilystrength, his mind retained its full vigor. When hewas informed that the Roman armies were shut up atthe Caudine forks, between the two glens, and wasasked for advice by his son's messenger, he gave hisopinion that they should all be immediately dismissedfrom thence unhurt. On this counsel being rejected,and the same messenger returning to advise with him-a second time, he recommended that they should all,to a man, be put to death.

of the camp, for that also was stormed, and the generalhimself, and many principal officers made prisoners.The town of Scissis too, which stood not far from thecamp, fell into the hands of the conquerors. The spoilof this town consisted of articles of trifling value ; thefurniture was mean, suiting harbarians, and the slavesof little price. But the camp amply enriched the sol­diers with the effects, not only of the army just nowconquerors, but likewise with those of the army serv­ing under Hannibal, who, to avoid being incumberedon their march with heavy baggage, had left almostall their valuable substance on that side of the Pyre­nees.
61. Hasdrubal, before any certain account of thisdisaster reached him, had crossed the Iberus with eightthousand foot and one thousand horse, intending tomeet the Romans at their first arrival: as soon as hewas informed of the ruin of affairs at Scissis, and theloss of the camp, he turned his route towards the sea.Not far from Tarraco, meeting the soldiers belonging' to the fleet, and the mariners scattered and stragglingthrough the country, among whom success, as is usual,had begotten negligence, he detached his cavalry inseveral parties against them, and with great slaughterand greater affright drove them to their ships. But notdaring to continue longer in that quarter, lest he mightbe surprised by Scipio, he withdrew to the other sideof the Iberus. On the other band Scipio, on hearingof this new enemy, hastened to the spot with all expe­dition, and after punishing a few of the commanders ofships, and leaving a small garrison at Tarraco, returnedwith the fleet to Emporiae. Scarcely had he departedwhen Hasdrubal arrived, and having prevailed on thestate of the Illergetans, which ,had given hostages toScipio to change sides, he, with the young men of thatstate, ravaged the lands of those who adhered withfidelity to their alliance with the Romans.

would wish the Samnites in possession of victory ra­ther than the Romans. He talked much of contemptof orders; as if his prohibition of fighting were notdictated by the same motive whrch caused his vexa­tion at the fight having taken place. He wished toshackle the valor of others, and meant to take awaythe soldiers' arms when they were most eager for ac­tion, and that no use might be made of them in hisabsence : he was farther enraged too, because Quin-tus Fabius considered himself as master of the horse,not as a beadle to the dictator. How would he havebehaved had the issue of the fight been unfortunate ;which, through the chances of war and the uncertaintyof military operations, might have been the case; sincenow, when the enemy has been vanquished, (as com­pletely indeed as if that leader's own singular talentshad been employed in the matter,) he yet threatensthe master of the horse with punishment ? Nor is hisrancor greater towards the master of the horse thantowards the military tribunes, towards the centurions,towards the soldiers. On all he would vent his rage ;and because that is not in his power, he vents it onone. Envy, like flame, soars upwards ; aims at thesummit, and makes its attack on the head of the busi­ness, on the leader. If he could put him out of theway, together with the glory of the service performed,he would then triumph like a conqueror over van­quished troops; and without scruple practise againstthe soldiers what he had been allowed to act againsttheir commander. It behoved them therefore in hiscause to support the general liberty of all. If thedictator perceived among the troops the same una­nimity in justifying their victory, that they had dis­played in gaining it, and that all interested themselvesin the safety of one, it would bend his temper tomilder counsels.

honor, the merits of Fabius were so great towards thecommonwealth, and towards himself in particular, thathe would gladly contribute to the advancement of hisreputation, in every instance where its splendor couldbe increased without reflecting dishonor on himself.But who did not see that, when a war of difficulty anddanger, and out of the ordinary course, was committedto only that one consul, the other would be consideredas useless and insignificant? Fabius gloried in his ex­ploits performed in Etruria: Publius Decius wishedfor a like subject of glory, and perhaps would utterlyextinguish that fire, which the other left smothered, insuch a manner that it often broke out anew in suddenconflagrations. In fine, honors and rewards he wouldconcede to his colleague, out of respect to his age anddignified character: but when danger, when a vigorousstruggle with an enemy was before them, he never did,nor ever would, willingly give place. With respect tothe present dispute, this much he would gain at allevents, that a business appertaining to the jurisdictionof the people should be determined by an order of thatpeople, and not complimented away by the senate. Heprayed Jupiter, supremely good and great, and all theimmortal gods, not to grant him an equal chance withhis colleague, unless they intended to grant him equalability and success in the management of the war. Itwas certainly in its nature reasonable, in the examplesalutary, and concerned the reputation of the Romanpeople, that the consuls should be men of such abili­ties, that either of them was fully equal to the com­mand iu a war with Etruria.' Fabius, after just re­questing of the people that before the tribes were calledin to give their votes they would hear the letters ofthe pretor Appius Claudius, written from Etruria,withdrew from the Comitium, and the people, not lessunanimously than the senate, decreed to him the pro­vince of Etruria, without having recourse to lots.

great many who were unhurt yet fell as if thunder­struck. Such were the changes of fortune on the leftwing of the Romans : on the right, Fahius had at firstprotracted the time, as we mentioned above, in slowoperations; then as soon as he perceived that neitherthe shout, nor the efforts of the enemy, nor the wea­pons which they threw, retained their former force,ordered the commanders of the cavalry to lead roundtheir squadrons to the wing of the Samnites, and, onreceiving the signal, to charge them in flank, with allpossible violence, he commanding at the same timehis infantry to advance leisurely and drive the enemyfrom their ground. When he saw that they were un­able to maintain their posts, and manifestly spent withfatigue, drawing together all his reserves, whom hebad kept fresh for that occasion, he made a brisk pushwith the legions, giving the cavalry the signal tocharge. The Samnites could not support the shock,but fled precipitately to their camp, passing by theline of the Gauls, and leaving their allies to fight bythemselves. These stood in close order under coverof their shields : Fabius, therefore, having heard ofthe death of his colleague, ordered the squadron ofCampanian cavalry, in number about five hundred, tofall back from the ranks, ride round, and attack therear of the Gallic line, sending the chief strength ofthe third legion after these, with directions that wher­ever they should see the enemy's troops disordered bythe charge, to follow the blow, and cut them to piecesbefore they recovered from their consternation. Aftervowing a temple and the spoils which might fall intohis hands to Jupiter the Victorious, he proceeded tothe camp of the Samnites, whither all their forceswere hurrying in confusion. The gates not affordingentrance to such very great numbers, those who werenecessarily excluded attempted resistance just at thefoot of the rampart, and here fell Gellius Egnatius theSamnite general. These however were soon drivenwithin the rampart; the camp was taken after a slightdispute ; and at the same time the Gauls were attacked

he asserted that his life should sooner be forced fromhim, than the glory of his past services ; clearing him­self, and accusing the other by turns, so that the dic­tator's anger blazed out with fresh fury; and he or­dered the master of the horse to be stripped, and therods and axes to be got ready. Fabius, imploring theprotection of the soldiers, while the lictors were tear­ing his garments, retired to the quarters of the ve­terans, who were already raising a commotion in theassembly : from them the uproar spread through thewhole body ; in one place the voice of supplicationwas heard; in another, menaces. Those who hap­pened to stand nearest to the tribunal, because, beingunder the eyes of the general, they could easily beknown, applied to bim with intreaties to spare themaster of the horse, and not in him to condemn thewhole army. The remoter parts of the assembly, andthe crowd collected round Fabius, railed at the unre­lenting spirit of the dictator, and were not far frommutiny : nor was even the tribunal perfectly quiet.The lieutenants-general, standing round the general's'seat, besought him to adjourn the business to the nextday, and to allow time to his anger, and room for con­sideration ; representing that ' the indiscretion of Fa­bius had been sufficiently rebuked ; his victory suffi­ciently disgraced; and they begged him not to pro­ceed to the extreme of severity; not to brand withignominy a youth of extraordinary merit, or his fa­ther, a man of most illustrious character, together with .the whole family of the Fabii.' When neither theirprayers nor arguments made any impression, they de­sired him to observe the violent ferment of the assem­bly, and told him that ' while the soldiers' temperswere heated to such a degree, it became not either hisage or his wisdom to kindle them into a flame, and af­ford matter for a mutiny: that no one would lay theblame of such an event on Quintus Fabius, whoonly deprecated punishment; but on the dictator, if,blinded by resentment, he should by an ill-judgedcontest draw on himself the fury of the multitude: and

every man of character in the city. After frequentlyappealing to the jEmilian law, and bestowing commen-' dations on Mamercus jEmilius, who, in his dictator­ship, had been the author of it, for having contracted'within the space of a year and six months the censor-*ship, which had formerly lasted five years, and was apower which, in consequence of its long continuance,often became tyrannical, he proceeded thus : ' Tell me,Appius Claudius, in what manner you would haveacted had you been censor at the time when Caius Fu-rius and Marcus Geganius were in that office V Appiusinsisted that ' the tribune's question was irrelevant tohis case: for although the jEmilian law might biudthose censors, during whose magistracy it was passedbecause the people made that law after they had be­come censors ; and whatever order is the last passedby the people, that is held to be the law, and valid :—yet neither he nor any of those who had been createdcensors subsequent to the passing of that law could bebound by it.'

While Appius urged such frivolous argumentsas these, which carried no conviction whatever, theother said, ' Behold, Romans, the offspring of thatAppius, who, being created decemvir for one year,created himself for a second ; and who, during a third,without being created even by himself or by any other,held on the fasces and the government; nor ceased tocontinue in office until the government itself, ill ac­quired, ill administered, and ill retained, overwhelmedhim in ruin.

The consuls at Rome, at that time,were Publius Cornelius Scipio and Tiberius Sempro-nius Longus; who, after having introduced the ambas­sadors to the senate, proposed that the state of the publicaffairs should be taken into consideration. It was re­solved that ambassadors should be sent into Spain, toinspect the affairs of the allies ; instructed, if they sawsufficient reason, to warn Hannibal not to molest theSaguntines, the confederates of the Roman people ; andalso to pass over into Africa, to represent at Carthagethe complaints of these to the Romans. After this em­bassy had been decreed, and before it was despatched,news arrived, which no one had expected so soon, thatSaguntum was besieged. The business was then laidin tire before the senate, as if no resolution had yetpassed. Some were of opinion that the affair shouldbe prosecuted with vigorous exertions, both by sea andland, and proposed that Spain and Africa should bedecreed as the provinces of the consuls : others wishedto direct the whole force of their arms against Spainand Hannibal; while many thought that it would beimprudent to engage hastily in a matter of so greatimportance, and that they ought to wait for the returnof the ambassadors from Spain. This opinion beingdeemed the safest, was adopted ; and the ambassadors,Publius Valerius Flaccus and Quintus Baebius Tam-philus, were on that account despatched, with thegreater speed, to Saguntum, to Hannibal; and, in caseof his refusing to desist from hostilities, from thenceto Carthage, to insist on that, general being deliveredup to atone for the infraction of the treaty.

You must not pass the Iberus ; you must not meddlewith the Saguntines ; Saguntum is on our side of theIberus; you must not stir a foot.

They may be timid and dastardly, who canlook for refuge behind them, who can fly through safeand quiet roads, and be received into their own terri­tories and their own lands. For your part, necessityobliges you to be brave ; and, since every mean be->tween victory and death is sunk out of reach, youmust resolve to conquer, or should fortune be unfa­vorable, to meet death in battle rather than in flight.If this determination be firmly fixed in'every one ofyour breasts, I affirm again, you are conquerors.

While they were employedin this work the Carthaginians sent Maharbal, with asquadron of five hundred Numidian horse, to ravagethe lands of the allies of the Roman people. He or­dered him to spare the Gauls as much as possible, andto endeavor, by persuasion, to bring over their chiefsto his side. When the bridge was finished, the Ro­man army marched over into the country of the Insu-brians, and sat down at the distance of five miles fromVictumviae.

in the Campanian territory. Both the consuls weretherefore sent into Samnium, and proceeded to differentregions, Postumius to Tifernum, Minucius to Bovia-num. The first engagement happened at Tifernum,where Postumius commanded. Some say that theSamnites were completely defeated, and twenty thou­sand of them made prisoners. Others, that the armyseparated without victory on either side; and thatPostumius, counterfeiting fear, withdrew his forcesprivately by night, and marched away to the mountains;whither the enemy also followed, and took possessionof a stronghold two miles distant. The consul, havingcreated a belief that he had come thither for the sakeof a safe post, and a fruitful spot, (and such it reallywas,) secured his camp with strong works. Furnishingit with magazines of every thing useful, he left a strongguard to defend it; and at the third watch led awaythe legions lightly accoutred, by the shortest road whichhe could take, to join his colleague, who lay oppositeto his foe. There, by advice of Postumius, Minuciuscame to an engagement; and when the fight had con­tinued doubtful through a great part of the day, Post­umius, with his fresh legions, made an unexpectedattack on the enemy's line, spent by this time withfatigue : thus, weariness and wounds having renderedthem incapable even of flying, they were cut off to aman, and twenty-one standards taken. The Romansthen proceeded to Postumius' station, where the twovictorious armies falling on the enemy, already dis­mayed by the news of what had passed, routed and dis­persed them : twenty-six military standards were takenhere, and the Samnite general, Statius Gellius, with agreat number of other prisoners, and both the camps,fell into the hands of the conquerors. Next day Bovia-nuui was besieged, and soon after taken. Both theconsuls were honored with a triumph, and with highapplause of their excellent conduct.

first onset, nor the standards moved either forward orbackward, nor any ground lost on either side. Theyfought without taking breath, every man in his post,and pushing agaiust their, opponents with their shields.The Doise continuing equal, and the terror of the fightthe same, seemed to denote that the decision would beeffected either by fatigue or by the night. The menhad now exhausted their strength, the sword its power,and the leaders their skill; when, on a sudden, theSamnite cavalry, having learned from a single troopwhich had advanced beyond the rest that the baggageof the Romans lay at a distance from their army, with­out any guard or defence, eager for booty, they has­tened to attack it: of which the dictator being informedby a hasty messenger, said, ' Let them alone ; let themincumber themselves with spoils.' Afterwards cameseveral, one after another, crying out that they wereplundering and carrying off all the effects of the sol­diers : he then called to him the master of the horse,and said, ' Do you see, Marcus Fabius, that the ene­my's cavalry have forsaken the fight ? They are en­tangled and incumbered with our baggage. Attackthem : you will find them, as is the case of every mul­titude employed in plundering, scattered about; fewmounted on horseback, few with swords in their hands;and, while they are loading their horses with spoil,and unarmed, put them to the sword, and make itbloody spoil for them. I will take care of the legionsand the fight of the infantry; yours be the honor whichthe horse shall acquire.'

The body of cavalry, in the most exact orderpossible, charging the enemy, who were straggling andembarrassed, filled every place with slaughter; for thepackages which they hastily threw down, and whichlay in the way of their feet, and of the affrighted horses,as they endeavored to escape, made them unable eitherto fight or fly. Then Fabius, after he had almost in-tirely cut off the enemy's horse, led round his squadronsin a small circuit, and attacked the infantry in the rear.The new shout raised in that quarter terrified the Sam-

off to the cavalry, posted on the extremities of the line,and, exhorting them to join in putting in for a share ofthe honor, charged the enemy on the flanks. The Ro­man legions, on observing the confusion of the Sam­nites, by being thus assailed on both sides, renewedthe shout, and rushing forcibly on them, they began tofly. And now the plains were quickly filled with heapsof bodies and splendid armor. At first their camp re­ceived the dismayed Samnites; but they did not longretain even the possession of that: before night it wastaken, plundered, and burnt. The dictator triumphed,in pursuance of a decree of the senate ; and the mostsplendid spectacle by far, of any in his procession, wasthe captured arms : so magnificent were they deemed,that the shields, adorned with gold, were distributedamong the owners of the silver shops, to serve as em­bellishments to the forum. Hence, it is said, arose thecustom of the forum being decorated by the ediles,when the grand processions are made, on occasion ofthe great games. The Romans, indeed, converted theseextraordinary arms to the honor of the gods : but theCampanians, out of pride, and in hatred of the foe,gave them as ornaments to their gladiators, who usedto be exhibited as a show at their feasts, and whomthey distinguished by the name of Samnites. Duringthis year the consul Fabius fought with the remnantsof the Etrurians at Perusia, which city also had vio­lated the truce, and gained an easy and decisive vic­tory. After this he marched up to the walls of thetown, and would have taken it, had not deputies comeout and capitulated. Having placed a garrison at Pe­rusia, and sent on before him to the Roman senate theembassies of Etruria, who solicited friendship, the con­sul rode into the city in triumph, for successes moreimportant than those of the dictator. Besides, a greatshare of the honor of reducing the Samnites was attri­buted to the lieutenant-generals, Publius Decius andMarcus Valerius: whom, at the next election, thepeople, with universal consent declared the one con­sul, the other pretor.

No degree of labor could either fatigue hisbody or break bis spirit: heat and cold he enduredwith equal firmness: the quantity of his food anddrink was limited by natural appetite, not by the plea­sure of the palate. His seasons for sleeping andwaking were not distinguished by the day, or by thenight; whatever time he had to spare, after businesswas finished, that he gave to repose, which howeverhe never courted, either by a soft bed or quiet retire­ment : he was often seen, covered with a cloak, lyingon the ground in the midst of the soldiers on guard,and on the advanced posts. His dress had nothingparticular in it beyond that of others of the samerank; his horses and his armor he was always re­markably attentive to: and whether he acted amongthe horsemen, or the infantry, he was eminently thefirst of either, the foremost in advancing to the fight,the last who quitted the field of battle. These greatvirtues were counterbalanced in him by vices of equalmagnitude; inhuman cruelty ; perfidy beyond that ofa Carthaginian ; a total disregard of truth, and ofevery obligation deemed sacred : utterly devoid of allreverence for the gods, he paid no regard to an oath,no respect to religion. Endowed with such a disposi­tion, a compound of virtues and vices, he served underthe command of Hasdrubal for three years, duringwhich he omitted no opportunity of improving himselfin every particular, both of theory and practice, thatcould contribute to the forming of an accomplishedgeneral.

Then silence beingmade, a crier cited Quintus Fabius, master of thehorse, and as soon as, on the lower ground, he hadapproached the tribunal, the dictator said, ' QuintusFabius, I demand of you, when the authority of dic­tator is acknowleged to be supreme, and is submittedto by the consuls, officers endowed with regal power ;and likewise by the pretors, created under the sameauspices with consuls ; whether or no you think itreasonable that it should not meet obedience from amaster of the horse ? I also ask you whether, when Iknew that I set out from home under uncertain aus­pices, it was for me, under that consideration, to ha­zard the safety of the commonwealth, or whether myduty did not require me to have the auspices newlytaken, so that nothing might be done while the will ofthe gods remained doubtful? And farther, when a re­ligious scruple was of such a nature as to hinder thedictator from acting, whether the master of the horsecould be exempt from it, and at liberty ? But why doI ask these questions, when, supposing that I had gonewithout leaving any orders, your own judgment oughtto have been regulated according to what you coulddiscover of my intention? Why do you not answer?Did I not forbid you to act, in any respect, during myabsence ? Did I not forbid you to engage the enemy ?Yet, in contempt of these my orders, while the aus­pices were uncertain, while the omens were confused,contrary to the practice of war, contrary to the disci­pline of our ancestors, and contrary to the authority ofthe gods, you dared to enter on the fight. Answer tothese questions proposed to you. On any other mat­ter utter not a word. Lictor, draw near him.' Toeach of these particulars Fabius, finding it no easymatter to answer, at one time remonstrated againstthe same person acting as accuser and judge, in acause which affected his very existence; at another,

happened, occasioned principally by a sudden erilp»tion of the townsmen during the fight: but Camillus,making part of his troops face about, not only drovethem within the walls, but, after utterly discomfitingboth themselves and their allies, took the city thesame day by scalade. It was then resolved, theirtroops being flushed with victory, that they shouldproceed until they had made an intire conquest of allLatium. This plan they prosecuted without intermis­sion, making themselves masters of some of the townsby force, and of others by capitulation, reducing theintire country to subjection. Then leaving garrisonsin the conquered places, they returned to Rome to en­joy the triumph to which all men allowed they werejustly intitled. To a triumph was added the honor ofhaving equestrian statues erected to them in the fo­rum, a compliment very rare in that age. Before theassembly for electing consuls was called for the en­suing year, Camillus moved the senate to take intoconsideration the conduct to be observed towards thestates of Latium, and proceeded in this manner: ' Con­script fathers, whatever was to be eflected in Latiumby means of arms and military operations has now,through the favor of the gods, and the valor of yoursoldiers, been fully accomplished. The armies of ourenemies have been cut to pieces at Pedum and theAstura ; all the towns of Latium and Antium in theVolscian territory, either taken by storm or surren­dered, are held by your garrisons. It remains thento be considered, since the frequent rebellious of thesepeople are the cause of so much trouble, by whatmeans we may secure their quiet submission andpeaceable behavior. The attainment of this end theimmortal gods have placed within your reach, inso­much that they have given you the power of deter­mining whether Latium shall longer exist or not. Youcan therefore insure to yourselves perpetual peace, asfar as regards the Latines, by the means either of se­verity or of mercy. Do you choose to adopt cruelmeasures against people vanquished, and submitting to

of consular dignity should not be ashamed to exhibitsuch mockery of religion in the face of day! andshould have recourse to such shallow artifices to pal­liate their breach of faith, as not even children wouldallow themselves ! Go, lictor, take off the bonds fromthose Romans. Let no one hinder them to departwhen they think proper.' Accordingly they returnedunhurt from Caudium to the Roman camp, having ac­quitted certainly their own faith, and perhaps that ofthe public. "
12. The Samnites finding that instead of peace whichflattered their pride, the war was revived, and withthe utmost inveteracy, not only felt in their minds aforeboding of all the consequences which ensued, butsaw them in a manner before their eyes. They now,too late, and in vain, applauded the plans of old Pon­tius, by blundering between which they had exchangeda certainty of victory for an uncertain peace ; andwere now to fight against men, whom they might haveeither put out of the way for ever as enemies, or en­gaged for ever as friends. And such was the changewhich had taken place in men's minds, since the Cau-dine peace, even before any trial of strength had shownan advantage on either side, that Postumius, by sur­rendering himself, had acquired greater renown amongthe Romans than Pontius among the Samnites by hisbloodless victory. The Romans considered their beingat liberty to make war as certain victory; while theSamnites supposed the Romans victorious the momentthey resumed their arms. Meanwhile, the Satricansrevolted to the Samnites, who attacked the colony ofFregellae, by a sudden surprise in the night, accom­panied, as it appears, by the Satricans. From thattime until day their mutual fears kept both partiesquiet: the daylight was the signal for battle, whichthe Fregellans contrived to maintain for a considerabletime without loss of ground ; for they fought for theirreligion and liberty ; and the multitude who were unfitto bear arms assisted them from the tops of thehouses.

I am also of opinion that the consuls, in themean time, enlist, arm, and lead out an army; but thatthey should not enter the enemy's territories beforeevery particular respecting the surrender of us be re­gularly executed. And, O immortal gods! I pray andbeseech you that, although it has not been your willthat Spurius Postumins and Titus Veturius, in the of­fice of consuls, should wage war with success againstthe Samnites, you may yet deem it sufficient to haveseen us sent under the yoke; to have seen us boundunder an infamous convention; to have seen us shackled,and delivered into the hands of our foes, taking on ourown heads the whole weight of the enemy's resentment.And grant that the consuls and legions of Rome maymeet the same fortune in war against the Samniteswhich has attended them in every war before we be­came consuls.' On his concluding this speech, men'sminds were so impressed with admiration and compas­sion, that they could scarce believe him to be the sameSpurius Postumius who had been the author of soshameful a peace ; lamenting, at the same time, thatsuch a man was likely to undergo, among the enemy,a punishment even beyond that of others, through thedesire of annulling the peace. All the members, show­ing tenderness towards him, expressed their approba­tion of his sentiments, when Lucius Livius and QuintusMajlius, being tribunes of the commons, attempted fora time to stop the proceeding by a protest; insistingthat ' the people could not be acquitted of the religiousobligation, from the consuls being given up, unless allthings were restored to the same state in which theyhad been at Caudium; nor had they themselves de­served any punishment for having, by becoming sure­ties to the peace, preserved the army of the Romanpeople; nor, finally, could they, being sacred and in­violable, be surrendered to the enemy, or treated withviolence.'

However, whetherin consequence of their having drawn together, fromevery state, the whole of the force which it possessed,or that the consideration of their all being at stakeheightened their courage, they maintained, even inopen fight, a formidable struggle. Fabius, when hesaw that the enemy in no place gave way, ordered hisson Maximus and Marcus Valerius, military tribunes,with whom he hastened to the front, to seek the cavalry,and to exhort them, that ' if they remembered any in­stance wherein the public had received advantage fromthe service of the horsemen they would on that dayexert themselves to preserve inviolate the renown ofthat body ; telling them that the enemy stood immova­ble against the efforts of the infantry, and the onlyhope remaining was in the charge of horse.' He ad­dressed particularly both these youths, and with thesame cordiality, loading them with praises and pro­mises. At the same time, considering that in case thateffort should a1so fail, it would be necessary to accom­plish by stratagem what his strength could not effect,he ordered Scipio, one of his lieutenants-general, todraw off the spearmen of the first legion out of theline; to lead them round as secretly as possible to thenearest mountains ; and, in such direction as he couldascend without being seen, to gain the heights, andshow himself suddenly on the rear of the enemy, whiletheir attention should be employed on the front. Thecavalry, led on by the tribunes, rushing forward unex­pectedly before the van, caused scarcely more confusionamong the enemy than among their friends. The lineof the Samnites stood firm against the furious onset ofthe squadrons ; it neither could be driven from itsground, nor broken in any part. The cavalry, findingtheir attempts fruitless, withdrew from the fight, andretired behind the line of infantry. On this the enemyassumed new spirits, with increasing confidence in their
