with a bow like those in Scythia, and with the skin of aleopard thrown about her shoulders.
Above Penthefilea there are certain persons carryingwater in earthen urns full of holes. One of these re­sembles a virgin in the flower of her youth, but the otherappears to be more advanced in age. There is no inscrip­tion on each of these women; but a common inscriptionon them shews that they are of the number of the unini­tiated. The women that are above these are, Callistothe daughter of Lycaon, Nomia, and Pero the daughterof Neleus, For this last, Ncleus demands an ox of Iphi-clus as a sponfal gist. Callisto has the hide of a bear forher bed-covering; and her feet are placed on the knees ofNomia. I have before shewn that, according to the Ar­cadians, Nomia was one of the nymphs belonging totheir country. According to poets, indeed, nymphs livea great number of years, but yet are not entirely exemptfrom death. After Callisto and the women that are withher, there is a representation of a precipice, to ^he sum­mit of which Sisyphus the son of, Æolus endeavours toroll a stone. In the fame part of the picture there are a'large vessel, an old man, a boy, and women sitting on astone. One of these, of the same age with the old man,stands by him; but the others are carrying water. Youmay conjecture that the old woman is pouring out theremains of the water from the perforated vessel, into thelarge vessel again. It appears to me, that these person*despised the Eleufinian mysteries. For the more ancientGreeks considered these mysteries as much superior indignity to all other institutions, which lead to piety, asgods are to heroes. Below this large vessel, Tantalus isrepresented suffering those punishments wluch are men­

CHAP. XXXII.that dwell in Creusis, which is a liayen of tho


Thespians, have no public building or statue which de­serves to be mentioned : but in the house of a private per­son-in Creusis there is a statue of Bacchus, which is madeof plaster, and adorned with pictures. But the passage bjrsea to Creufis from Peloponnesus is winding and stormy.The promontories which run in(o the sea, give such acurvature to the shores, that ships cannot fail in a directline, and the winds blow violently from the neighbouringmountains. On sailing from Creusis, not upwards butnear Boeotia, you will fee the city Thisbe on the righthand. And in the first place there is a mountain nearthe sea. When you have passed beyond this you willsee a plain, and after this another mountain, in the bottompart of which there is a city. In this city there is a templeof Hercules, and in it a stone statue in an upright po­sition. They celebrate .here a festival, which they callHeracleia. Nothing would hinder the plain which lies herebetween the mountains from becoming a lake, throughthe great quantity of water in this part, if they did notraise a strong bank through the middle of the plain, turnthe water every year to places beyond the bank, and cul­tivate the other parts cf the plain. They fay that thenymph Thisbe, from whom the city is denominated, wasa native of this place. On sailing from hence you willsee a small city near the sea, which is called Tipha. Therejs a temple of Hercules here, in which they celebrate a

j8o THE DESCRIPTION


know of any poet that has mentioned Eresus and Lao-medon in his verses. Here too the house of Antenor isrepresented; and over the vestibule of it the skin of aleopard is suspended. This was hung up as a signal to theGreeks, that they should not injure the house of Antenor.Theano likewise is painted with her sons. One of these,Glaucus, sits on a coat of mail joined together with hol­low parts t and Eurymachus sits on a stone. Near himstands Antenor, and after him follows Crino the daughterof Antenor. She holds in her arms an infant boy. AHthese are painted with sorrowful countenances. Servantsare placing a chest and other furniture on an ass : and alittle boy sits on the ass. In this part of the picture thereis the following elegy of Simonides:

ThE other part of the picture, which is on the lefthand, represents Ulysses descending to Hades, that he mayconsult the soul of Tiresias about his safe return to his na­tive country. The particulars of the painting are as fol­low:—A river presents itself to the view, which is evidentlyAcheson. Reeds are seen in this river, and fishes whoseforms are so obscure that you might conjecture they wererather shadows than fishes. There is a ship too in thisriver, and a ferryman standing by its oars. Polygnotus, asit appears to me, in this part of the picture had an eye to

lay aside their fear, and promised them that he would de­fend his own. The Grecian cities that fought on this oc­casion in order to take vengeance on the enemies of thegod were these*: The Phocenses from all their cities;four hundred henvy-armed soldiers from Amphissa. Fromthe Ætolians, a few only assembled at first, when theywere told of the march of the Barbarians, but afterwardsPhilomelus led one thousand two hundred. Of the Æto­lians, such as were the most vigorous turned themselvesto the army of Acichorius. They did not however cometo any engagement with the Gauls, but molested the rearof their army as they were marching, plundered theirbaggage, and flew those that defended it. And by thismeans the march of the Barbarians was impeded. ButAcichoiius left a part of his forces at Heraclea, for thepurpose of defending the riches in his camp The armyof Brennus, therefore, was opposed by the Greeks thatassembled together at Dclphos. And the god at this timeshewed that he was adverse to the Barbarians, by prodigiesthe most conspicuous of any that we are acquainted with.For all that part of the earth which was occupied by thearmy of the Gauls, was violently shaken for the greaterpart of the day, and this was accompanied with continuedthunder and lightning. The Gauls in consequence os thiswere greatly terrified, and rendered incapable of hearingthe orders of their commanders. The lightning too thatdestroyed any individual, burnt at the fame time thosethat were near him, together with their arms. Besides allthis, the spectres of heroes were then seen—Hyperochus,Laodocus, and Pyrrhus •, and the fourth of these, accord­ing to the Delphi, was Fhylacus, who was a native oftheir city.

mvengers of actions. They swear on the altars os these god­desses, and never violate the oath which they have thu#taken. This temple is near the mountain Tilphussius. Butin Haliartus there are temples in which there are nostatues, because the temples are without roofs. To whatdivinities these were dedicated I have not been able tolearn. The river Lophis flows through the Haliartianland. It is said, that this country at first was very dry,owing to its being totally destitute of water, and that oneof the principal inhabitants went to Delphos to inquireby what means water might be found: that the Pythiandeity answered him, that he must flay the first person hemet on his return to Haliartus; and that he happeningto meet first of all with Lophis the son of Parthenomenes,immediately struck the youth with his sword. That Lo­phis yet breathing ran round the place in which he waswounded •, that wherever his blood fell on the groundthere water ascended; and that from this circumstancethe river was called Lophis.
Alalcomenæ is a village by no means large, and issituated at the extremities of a mountain not very lofty.They fay, that this place was denominated from a nativeAlalcomenes, who was the nurse of Minerva. But, ac­cording to others, it was called after Alalcomenia, whowas the daughter of Ogygus. At some distance from thisvillage a temple of Minerva stands in a plain; and in itthere is an ancient statue of ivory. Sylla, indeed, wasguilty of many cruelties towards the Athenians, and hisconduct, was very different from the manners of the Ro­mans. His behaviour too towards the Thebans and Or-chomenians resembled his conduct towards the Athe­nians: and from the Alakomenians he took away this

But Hermias the philosopher, in his MS. Commentary on thePhxdrus of Plato, gives us the following satisfactory informationrespecting the oracle in Dodona. The reader who is desirousof seeing the original of this passage, may find it in page 11 ofthe Collection of Oracles by Opsopoeus. "Different accountsare given of the Dodonean oracle; for it is the most ancient ofthe Grecian oracles. According to some, an oak prophesied inDodona; but according to others, doves. The truth howeveris, that priestesses whose heads were crowned with oak prophe­sied ; and these women were called by some peleiades, or doves.Perhaps therefore certain persons being deceived by the name,suspected that doves prophesied in Dodona; and as the headsof these women were crowned with oak, perhaps from this cir­cumstance they said that an oak prophesied. But this oraclebelongs to Jupiter, and that in Delphos to Apollo. With greatpropriety therefore are these oracles considered as allied to eachother. For Apollo is said to be the assistant of Jupiter in theadministration of things: and often when the Dodonean oracleappeared to be obscure, the oracle in Delphos has been consulted,in order to know the meaning of that of Jupiter. Often tooApollo has interpreted many of the Dodonean oracles.

Th E Phocenses border on the Orchomenians in thatpart which is near the mountains: but Lebadea borderson them in that part in which the plains arc situated.This city was formerly built in the more elevated part ofthe country, and was called Midea from the mother ofAspledon. But when Lebadus came from Athens, andsettled here, the inhabitants descended into the plains, andfrom him the city was called Lebadea. They neitherhowever know who his father was, nor on what accounthe came hither. They only know that his wife was Nice.This city is adorned in every respect similar to the mostflourishing cities of Greece. The grove of Trophonius isseparated from it: and they say that Hercyna, playing inthis place with the daughters of Ceres, unwillingly let agoose fall out of her hands, which afterwards fled into aCavern, and concealed itself under a stone: that Proser­pine came into the cavern, and took the bird from underthe stone: and that in the place where she had moved thestone water burst forth, which became a river, denomi­nated from this circumstance Hercyna. Near the banksof this river there is a temple of Hercyna; and in it thereis a statue of a virgin holding a goose in her hands. Thefountains of the river are in the cavern, torether withstatues in an upright position: and dragons are rolledround the sceptres of these statues. Any one would beinclined to conjecture, that these are the statues of Æscu­lapius and Hygia; but they may be the statues of Tro­phonius

which they say was denominated from the daughter ofOgygus. There is a temple here of Diana, which con­tains two flone statues: one of these holds a torch, andthe other is in the attitude of one shooting an arrow.They fay, that when the Greeks, in consequence of theprophesy os Chalcas, were about to sacrifice Iphigenia onthe altar in this temple, the goddess caused a stag to be thevictim instead of her. Even at present, too, they pre­serve in this temple the remains of the trunk of that plane-tree, which is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad. It islikewise said, that when the Greeks were detained atAulis by adverse winds, the wind on a sudden blew fromthe desired quarter; and then each person sacrificed toDiana whatever victims came to hand, both male andfemale: in consequence of this it became an establishedcustom in Aulis, to approve victims of every kind. Theyfliew a fountain here, near which a plane-tree grows;and on a hill near the tent of Agamemnon, there is abrazen threshold. But palm-trees grow before the temple,the fruit of which is not perfectly sweet to the taste, likethat of the palm-trees in Palæstine; but yet these datesare milder than those which are gathered in Ionia. Thereare not many inhabitants in Aulis; and these are all ofthem potters. The Tanagræi, too, and those that dwellabout Mycalessus and Harma, cultivate this land.

♦he Delphic prophetess predicted future events, but the mannerin which this was accomplished by the prophetesses in Colophonand Branchidæ j and satisfactorily shews us how the gods com­municate prophecy to mankind.
"It is acknowledged by all men, that the oracle in Colophongives its answers through the medium of water: for there is afountain in a subterranean dwelling, from which the prophetessdrinks; and on certain established nights, after many sacred ntelhave been previously perfoimed, and she has drunk of- the foun­tain, she delivers oracles, but is not visible to those that are pre­sent. That this water therefore is prophetic, is from hence ma­nifest. But how it becomes so, this (according to the proverb)is not for every man to know. For it appears as if a certain pro­phetic spirit pervaded through the water. This is not howeverin reality the cafe. For a divine nature does not pervade throughits participants in this manner, according to interval and division,but comprehends as it were externally, and illuminates the foun­tain, and fills it from itself with a prophetic power. For the in­spiration which the water affords is not the whole of that whichproceeds from a divine power, but the water itself only preparesus^tand purifies our luciform spirit, so that we may be able to re­ceive the divinity; while in the mean time there is a presence ofdivinity prior to this, and illuminating from on high. And thisindeed is not absent from any one, who through aptitude is ca­pable of being conjoined with it. But this divine illumination isimmediately present, and uses the prophetess as an instrument;she neither being any longer mistress of herself, nor capable ofattending to what she says, nor perceiving where (he is. Henceafter prediction she is scarcely able to recover herself. And be­fore she drinks the water, flic abstains from food for a whole dayand night; and retiring to certain sacred places, inaccessible tothe multitude, begins to receive in them the enthusiastic energyiThrough her departure, therefore, and separation from humanconcerns, she renders herself pure, and by this means adapted toVol. III.

that in this place he would be concealed with security. Awolf, however, rushed on the boy in his place of conceal­ment-, but a strong dragon winding himself round the ves­sel, defended him from the assaults of the wolf. The fathersome time after this came to fee his son, and supposingthat the dragon had destroyed him, hurled his dart at theanimal, and, together with the dragon, flew his son. Butwhen he understood from certain shepherds that the boywas slain by his own hands, and that the dragon had beenthe benevolent guardian of his son, he raised a funeralpile for the dragon and the boy in common: and they saythat the place retains vestiges of this funeral pile even atpresent, and that the city was denominated Ophitea fromthe dragon. In this city, that which principally deserve*to be inspected is an adytum, in which they perform theorgies of Bacchus. The entrance to this adytum is visible,but no statue belonging to it is apparent. It is said by theAmphiclcenses,that this god predicts to them future events,and affords them remedies against diseases. And the dis­eases, indeed, of the Amphicleenses and neighbouringcities are healed through the information imparted tothem in dreams. But the priest of the adytum possesses adivining power, and uses a divine afflatus. Tithroniumis about fifteen stadia distant from Amphiclea. Thistown is situated in a plain, and does not contain anythingwhich deserves to be mentioned. From Tithronium toDrymæa there is a distance of twenty stadia. But wherethe road which leads from Amphiclea to Drymxa jointwith that which leads from Tithronium, there are a groveand altar of Apollo, which belong to the Tithronenses.There is likewise a temple here, but it does not containany statue.

by what means a city may be taken. Attend therefore tomy words : Observe, how much those that guard the wallsdrink every day; for by this means you shall take the tur-reted city Phana." As they were unable to comprehend themeaning of this oracle, they determined to give over thesiege, and return home. Those too within the walls madeno account of the enemy; and hence, a certain womanleft the walls in order to draw water from a neighbouringfountain. A band of soldiers however took her prisoner,and brought her to their camps. From her the Achaianslearnt, that the inhabitants of the town used to distributeevery night the water of that fountain to each other, andthat this was the only water they had to drink. In con­sequence of this information the Achaians closed up thefountain with earth piled over it, and by this meanstook the city. The Rhodians too in Lindum dedicateda statue of Apollo, which stands near this statue ofMinerva. The Ambraciotx likewise dedicated a brazenass, in consequence of having vanquished the Molofli ina nocturnal engagement. For the Moloffi having laid anambush for the Ambraciotx in the night, an ass whohappened at that time to be driven from the fields to thetown attacked a female of his own species with a consi­derable degree of wantonness. This occasioned him tobray very Ipud; and the driver of the ass at the fame timecalling to him with an indistinct and rough voice, pro­duced such a dread in the Moloffi, that they immediatelyabandoned their enterprise. But the Ambraciotæ havingdetected their stratagem, attacked aad vanquished themin the night.

was Curnamed Hercules by the Ægyptians and Libyans.Nothing more remarkable is related of the father of Sar-dus, Maceris, than that he once came to Delphos. Sardusbrought a colony of Libyans to Ichnussa; and hence theisland came lo be called after the name of Sardus. Thiscolony of Libyans did not exterminate the natives. Thenatives however associated with the new inhabitants morethrough necessity than regard. The Libyans too, at thattime, were as ignorant in the art of building cities, asthe native inhabitants of this island : and hence, they dweltin straggling cottages, and in caverns. Some years afterthe Libyans had settled here, those Grecians that followedAristæus came into this island. They fay that Aristæuswas the son os Apollo and the nymph Cyrene, and thathaving bitterly lamented the misfortune of Actæon, andbeing hated by Bceotia and all Greece, he migrated toSardinia. Some too are of opinion, that Dædalus fledat the fame time through fear of the Cretan arms, andthat he assisted Aristæus in bringing a colony into Sar­dinia.' There is however no probability, that Dædaluscould be the companion of Aristæus, either in establishinga colony, or in any other undertaking, as Aristæus wasmarried to Autonoe the daughter of Cadmus, and Dædaluswas contemporary with Oedipus king of Thebes.
Aristæus, however, and the Grecians that followed him,did not build any city, because, as it appears to me, theywere neither numerous nor strong enough for this pur­pose. After Aristæus the Ibcri passed over into Sardiniaunder the command of Norax, and built a city whichthey called Nora. They fay that this city was the firstthat was built in this island; and that Norax was the son•f Mercury by Erythca the daughter of Geryon. A fourth

Polygriotusseems to have collected the enemies of Ulysses into oneplace. But the reason why Ajax the son of Oileus hatedUlysses, was because Ulysses advised the Greeks to stoneAjax to death, for the daring wickedness of his conducttowards Cassandra. I know too from the Cyprian verses,that Palamedes, when he once went a-fifhing,was drownedby Ulysses and Diomed. A little above Oilean Ajax, Me- .leager the son of Oeneus is painted, and appears to belooking at Ajax. All these except Palamedes have beards.With respect to the death os Meleager, Homer informsus, that he was destroyed by one of the Furies, throughthe imprecations of Althæa. But the poem called the greatEoea, and likewise the verses which are denominatedMinyaSy fay, that the Curetes were assisted by Apolloagainst the Ætolians, and that Meleager was flain byApollo. With respect to the firebrand, too, as that it wasgiven by the Fates to Althæa, that Meleager would ne­cessarily die when it was consumed by fire, and that Al­thæa in a sit of anger burnt it—these particulars werefirst of all described by Phrynichus the son of Polyphrad-mon, in the drama Pleuron:
"Dcstin'd to a horrid fateThrough his vengeful mother's hate;Through her machinations dire,lie wa", picre'd to death by fire,By a brand's devouring flame,Kindled by the fraudful dame."

ad ignorant opinion, which asserts all the godi of the ancientsto be nothing more than deified men.
Page 104. And that I might conjecture his lull, l$c.~\ That,in the heroic age, men abounded of a prodigious stature cannotbe denied, without supposing the whole of the Iliad to be afable:- though, on the other hand, to imagine with the ScotchGrammarian, that there has been a gradual declension of thestature of mankind from the most early periods, and that thehuman species will at last come to nothing, is an opinion tooextravagant and unphilosophical to deserve the labour of confu-tation. The fact is, that the superior strength and size of thecelebrated heroes of antiquity can only be accounted for satis­factorily, by having recourse to that recondite wisdom of theancients, which was first discoveicd in the colleges of the ./Egyp­tian priests, and was afterwards delivered Enigmatically by Py­thagoras, scientifically by Plato, and cnthcaJlicaUy, or according toa diific energy (iiSiaj-'xwf), by his latter disciples. From this mostarcane and sublime wisdom -we learn, that all the parts of theuniverse cannot participate the providence of the gods in a simi­lar manner, but that some of its parts must enjoy this eternally,and others temporally; some in a primary, and others in a secon­dary degree. For the universe being a perfect whole, must havea first, a middle, and a last part. But its first parts, as havingthe most excellent subsistence, must always exist according tonature; and its last parts must sometimes subsist according to,and sometimes contrary to nature. Hence the celestial bodies,which are the first parts of the universe, perpetually subsist ac­cording to nature, both the whole spheres, and the multitudeco-ordinate to these -wholes*; and the only alteration whichthey experience is a mutation of figure, and variation of lightat different periods: but in the sublunary region, while

As A polio, there­fore, from his analogy to the good, or the first cause, may very pro­perly be called the lejl (for Apollo emits from his esfenct intellec­tual, and the good superessential light), Diana likewise may be thusdenominated from her intimate alliance with Apollo.

On her knees she supports a cista,or chest, resembling such as are used in the solemn fes­tivals of Ceres. With respect toTellis, I have only heardthus much, that the poet Archilochus was his greatgrandson. They say that Cleoboea was the first thatbrought the mysteries of Ceres from the ifland Paros toThasus. On the banks of Acheron, an affair is repre*sented, which deserves to be particularly noticed. A littlebelow Charon, a son who had behaved unjustly to hisfather, is strangled by his father. For the ancients verymuch reverenced their parents, as may be inferred fromother examples, and from the actions of those in Catana,who are called the pious. For when this city was set onsire by mount Ætna, these paid no attention to the pre­servation of their silver and gold, but one of them took uphis father in his arms, and the other his mother, an/1 fledwith-them out of the city. Through the rapid fury how­ever of the fire, they found great difficulty in makingtheir escape; yet notwithstanding this, they did not leavetheir parents, but palled through the stream of fire, which,as they fay, separated itself into two parts, and neither in­jured them nor their parents.

In the Persian war, onepart of the army of Xerxes laid waste with fire andsword the land and city of the Haliartians, on account oftheir attachment to the interest of the Greeks. But inHaliartus there is a sepulchre of Lysandra the Lacedæ­monian. For when he drew near to Haliartus in orderto attack its walls, as the city was defended within by anarmy of Athenians and Thebans, these forces leaving thecity, a battle ensued, in which Lysander was slain. Indeed,Lysander appears to me to have merited, by his conduct,both the greatest praise and blame. For he gave a speci­men of consummate sagacity in warlike affairs when hecommanded thePeloponnesian fleet. For having attentivelywatched the motions of Antiochus the pilot of Alcibiades,at that time when the commander was absent, he inducedhim to hope,' that he would be able to engage in a navalbattle with the Lacedæmonians, and afterwards vanquishedhim trusting to his arrogance and temerity, not far fromthe walls of the Colophonians.

The same must be understood of every other divinity, consideredaccording to his highest subsistence j viz. that various other divi­nities of the fame characteristic proceed from him into the part*of the world: and if the reader carefully attends to this theory,when he reads Homer, or the fables of any other ancient theolo­gical poet, and is able to apply it properly, he will find that thetheology of the ancients is founded in a theory no less beautifullyconnected than astonishingly profound ; no less enchanting thanscientific; no less true than marvellous and mystic. See moreconcerning this most important subject, in my Note* on the Cra-tylus, and Introduction to the Parmenides of Plato; in myTranslation of Sallust on the Gods and the World; and of theEmperor Julian's Oration to the Sun, and to the Mother of theCods.
Page 4. Thegoddejses calledGcnetyllides.] The Scholiast uponAristophanes informs us that Genetyllis is an epithet of yeans,and that she is so called because she presides over the generationof animals. Perhaps therefore, as there are two Venuses, as weshall fee hereafter, the Genetyllides are these two.

the spheres of each of the elements remain on account of theirsubsistence as wholes, always according to nature, the parts ofthese wholes have sometimes a natural and sometimes an unna­tural subsistence: for tints alone can \he circle of generationunfold all the variety which it contains.
But the different periods in which these mutations happen,are called by Plato, with great propriety, periods of fertility andfierility: for in these periods a fertility or sterility of men, ani­mals and plants takes place; so that in fertile periods mankindwill be both more numerous, and upon the whole superior inmental and bodily endowments to the men of a barren period.And a similar reasoning must be extended to animals and plants.This is signified by Plato, though obscurely, in the followingpassage from the eighth book of his Republic: yahiwi pi,

"It is difficultfor a city so constituted to be moved from its establishment. Butsince every thing which is generated is obnoxious to corruption,neither can a constitution of this kind remain perpetually,but mustbe dissolved. And its dissolution is this: ji fertility and'sterilityof foul and bodies not only takes place in terrene plants, but also in ter­rene animals, when the revolutions of each of these conjoin the ambitsof their circles; -which are shorter to the shorter-lived, and con­trary-wife to the contrary."
The so much celebrated heroic age, therefore, was the result ofone of these fertile periods, in which men, transcending theherd of mankind both in practical and intellectual virtue,abounded on the earth. But in consequence of that beautiful pro­gression of things which takes place throughout the universe,viz. in consequence of multitude every where being suspendedfrom a monad,or uniting cause; and multitude exquisitely allied

That is, " Typhon is the cause of the violent motion of all-varioussubterranean vapours and waters, and the other elements. ButÆchidna is an avenging cause, and the punisher of rational andirrational souls; on which account her upper parts are those of avirgin, and her lower parts resemble those of a serpent. AndPython is the guardian of the whole of prophetic exhalation; or,we may fay with greater propriety, that he is the cause of the dis­order and obstruction about exhalations of this kind." As theprophetic power therefore proceeds originally from Apollo, theopposition of energy between Apollo and Python, and the domi-nion of that of the former over that of the latter, gave rife to thefable mentioned in this place by Paufanias. Diana too may besaid to have assisted Apollo in slaying Python, in consequence ofthe wonderful union between these two divinities.

On enteringinto the grove, you will fee a brazen bull, which wasmade by Theopropus Æginetes, and was the gift of theCorcyrxans. It is said that a bull once in Corcyra, havingleft the oxen his companions, and the pastures in whichhe fed, came near the sea and lowed; that in consequenceof his doing the fame every day, the herdsman went tothe sea-side, and beheld an almost infinite number oftunny fishes; and that when he had informed the Corey*rseans of this circumstance, they, on endeavouring tocatch these fishes, but without success, sent speculators(Theoroi) to Delphos. In compliance therefore with themai>.late of the oracle, they sacrificed a bull to Neptune,and immediately after the sacrifice caught the fishes.Hence they sent both to Olympia and Delphos a tenthpart of the value of what they caught, as a sacred of­fering.

Even atpresent therefore there are certain places in Sardiniawhich are called Iolaii; and Iolaus is honoured by theinhabitants. After the destruction of Troy, others of theTrojans saved themselves by flight, as well as the fol­lowers of Æneas. Of these one part was driven by tem­pests to Sardinia, and became mingled with the Greeksthat resided there prior to this circumstance. But the Bar­barians were prevented from warring on the Greeks andTrojans, because there was an equality on both sides in allwarlike preparations, and the river Thorsus, which flowsthrough the middle of the island, was a barrier to thejunction of the two parties. Many years after this,the Libyans came with a greater fleet to Sardinia, andattacking the Greeks that dwelt there, either flew themall, or at least left but a very few alive. But the Trojanson this occasion fled to the elevated parts of the island,and entrenching themselves iii mountains difficult of ac­cess through their ruggedness, and the hanging rocks withwhich they were surrounded, are even at present calledIlicnses. They are however in their form, the apparatusof their arms, and their manner of living, like the Afri­cans.

not believe that tins account of the animal is true, butthat the Indians have been induced to fabricate it, throughvehement dread of this wild beast. For they are deceivedwith respect to its colour, because the tiger, when it isbeheld in the fun, appears to be red, and of a colour similarto that of the sun. Or this deception may have arisen,from the swiftness of the beast, ot from its agility in turn­ing its body when it is not running, which is so great,that its colour, particularly -if beheld at a distance, cannotbe ascertained. Indeed, I am of opinion, that whoevertravels to the extremities of Africa, India, or Arabia, andis desirous of finding such animals as are produced inGreece, will, in the first place, discover that some of themare wanting; and, in the next place, will find otherswhich vary in certain particulars from those in Greece.'For man is not the only animal which varies in his form ina different air, and a different land, but other animals arcsubject to the same variety. Thus the Libyan asps arc ofthe fame colour with those in Egypt; but in Æthiopiathey are black as well as the men. Hence we ought nei­ther to believe in every report indiscriminately, nor yetrefuse our assent to the existence of other things, merelybecause they are rare. I have never indeed seen wingedserpents; but I am persuaded there Sre such animals, be­cause a Phrygian once brought into Icnia a scorpion,which had wings similar to those cf a locust.

And whenthe Athenians had one hundred vessels stationed in Ægos-potamos, Lysander made them his prize, through takingadvantage of the time when the sailors went on shore inorder to lay in water and fresh provisions.
He likewise exhibited the following specimen of justice:A dispute about money happened to take place, betweenAutelycus the pancratiast, whose image I have seen in thePrytaneum at Athens, and Eteonicus a Spartan. Herethe Spartan, whose abilities in defending his cause wereinferior to those of Autolycus, behaved notwithstandingso insplently, because the city of the Athenians was at thattime in the power of the thirty tyrants, and Lysander waspresent, that he struck his adversary, and because Autoly­cus defended himself, brought him to Lysander, expectingthat he would decide the affair in his favour. Lysander,however, accused Eteonicus of having acted unjustly, anddismissed him with reproaches and disgrace. These actionstherefore raised the reputation of Lysander: but the fol­lowing disgraced his character: At Ægospotamos he slewPhilocles the Athenian, who was one of the commandersof the Athenian fleet, and four thousand Athenian cay-tives besides, and would not suffer them to be buried,though the Athenians permitted the Persians that fell atMarathon, and Xerxes those Lacedæmonians that died 2tThermopylæ, to be buried.

ThIS war, indeed, which the Argives waged, deserves,in my opinion, to be celebrated beyond all the wars ofthe Greeks, during the heroic ages, as they are called.For the war of the Eleufinians against the other Athenians,and in like manner of the Thebans against the Minyæ,almost after one engagement, terminated in concord, andtreaties of peace. But the army of the Argives cameinto the middle of Bceotia, from the middle of Peleponne-sus; and Adrastus collected together his allied forces fromArcadia, and from the Messenians.

In conformity therefore to the admonition of the ora­cle, Erginus married a young woman, by whom he hadTrophonius and Agamedes; though it is said that Tropho-nius was the son of Apollo, and not of Erginus; which,indeed, I can easily be persuaded to believe, and this multbe the opinion of any one who goes to the oracle of Tro­phonius. They fay, that these sons of Erginus, as sconas they arrived at manhood, became very skilful jn build­ing temples for the gods, and palaces for kings. For theybuilt the temple of Apollo in Dclphos, and the treasuryof Hyrieus. In the wall of this treasury they placed onestone in such a manner, that they could take it out when­ever they pleased; and in consequence of this, they wereperpetually carrying away some part of the deposited trea-fsure. This silled Hyrieus with astonishment, as he foundthat the locks and seals had not been moved, and yet theamount of his wealth was perpetually diminished. Onthe vessels, therefore, in which his money was deposited,he fixed traps, or something of this kind, by which any­one that attempted to touch the money might be imme­diately caught. Hence Agamedes, when he entered thetreasury, was held fast in the snare : and Trophonius fear­ing lest, when it was day, his brother would be forced bytorments to confess that he was his associate in the theft,cut off the head of Agamedes. After this Trophonius was*swallowed up in an opening of the earth, in the groveof Lebadea, where there is a ditch, which is called after^Agamedes^ with a pillar raised ov$r it. Ascalaphus and

This curious passage throws light on the following from thefirst book of the Metamorphoses of Apuleius i "Magico su-surramine, amnes agiles reverti, mare pigrum colligari, vent»sinanimes expirare, solem inhiberi, lunam despumari, ilellas evelli,diem tolli, noctem teneri."

For it maybeinferred from Psellus, that witches formerly were able to causethe appearance of all this to take place. I only add, that thisMS. of Psellus On Demons forms no part of his treatise Onthe Energy of Damons, published by Gaulminus; for it never wagpublished.

is about seven stadia in circumference. While I was sur­veying it, those verses of Homer respecting Tityus cameinto my mind, in which he calls the city of the Pano-peans Callichoros, or delighting in the dance. I likewise re­collected, that in the contest for the dead body of Pa-troclus, he fays, that Schedius the son of Iphitus, and kingof the Phocenses, who was slain by Hector, dwelt inPanopeus. It appears to me, that the cause of his dwellinghere was his fear of the Bœotians (for Phocis in this partis very much exposed to the attacks of the Bœotians),and that he used Panopeus as a place of defence. I was*iot however able to conjecture why Homer called Pano­peus Callichoros, till I learnt the reason from those Athe­nians who are called Thyades. These Thyades are Atticwomen, who every year come to Parnassus, and, togetherwith Delphic women, celebrate the orgies of Bacchus.It is an established custom with the Thyades, to formchoirs in the road from Athens, in other places, and amongthe Panopcans. Homer, therefore, by the appellationPanopeus, appears to signify the choir of the Thyades.
In the public road of the Panopeans there is a buildingof crude tiles, and in it a statue of Pentelican stone, whichsome say is the statue of Æsculapius, and others of Pro­metheus. These last think their opinion is confirmedfrom hence : Near the chasm formed by the torrent, thereare stones of such a magnitude that each is sufficient toload a cart. These stones are of the colour of clay, yetnot of such clay as is dug out of the earth, but of suchas is found among the gravel of rivers and torrents. Thesestones too smell very much like a human body \ and theysay that these are the remains of that clay, from whichthe whole race of mankind was fashioned by Prometheus.

verses of Homer alluded to by Pausanias are these, which maybe found in the 23d book of the Iliad:
Sperchius! whose waves In mazy errours lostDelightful roll along my native coast!To whom my father vow'd at my return,These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn.
I only add, that the obscure and intricate mode of expression em*ployed by Pausanias in the present passage, and which he so fre­quently adopts, led me into an error in the translation of it, fromnot recollecting at the time the verses of Homer alluded to. I begthe reader, therefore, to correct the passage as follows: "that Pe-leus vowed the hair of Achilles to the river Sperchius, for his safereturn from Troy."
Page 109. Mild Jupiter.'] It appears that Jupiter Misubiut,ot mild Jupiter, is the fame with that power called the Damontin the Orphic hymns: for in the hymn to him he is expresslycalled y.u\\yun A.a, mild Jupiter. It appears too, that this deityis the fame with the Janus of the Romans. For in the hymnjust cited there is the following line:
i. e.
<*In thee, the keys of joy and sorrow are carried."
And Janus, it is well known, wasi represented as a porter.Scaliger indeed, in the translation of this line, expressly as­signs two epithets'to this divinity, which belong only to Janus,L e. Patulcius and Clufius, the power that opens and shuts.

drew up in order of battle with silence and great regu­larity. And when the two armies came to a close engage­ment, the Grecian foot ran so far beyond their station,that they caused contusion in their own phalanx ; but thelight-armed troops remaining in their proper ranks, dis­charged at the enemy their darts, arrows, and slings.
The horse in each army was perfectly useless, and thisnot only through the narrow passages of the mountain,which they call gates, but through the smoothness andf.ipperiness of the ground, from its rocky nature, andfrom frequent and abundant inundations of rivers. Thearmour of the Gauls too was inferior in strength to thatof the Greeks; for they had no other defence for theirbodies than those shields which they call ihureoi: and whatwas of still greater consequence, the Gauls were far in­ferior in military experience to their enemies. However,in battle they rushed on the Greeks with a degree oflinger and fury resembling the attacks of wild beasts; sothat their rage, while life remained, suffered no abate­ment, though they were maimed by the battle-ax, cutdown with the sword, or pierced with arrows and darts.Some of them, too, when wounded, sent back the dartswhich they tore from their wounds on the Greeks, orpierced with these darts the Greeks that stood near them.In the mean time the three-oared galleys of the Athenianscould scarcely, and not without danger, discharge theirrnissive weapons of every kind at the enemy, owing totheir sailing through mud, because the river was at a greatdistance from the sea, and being obliged to bring theirVessels very near the Barbarians.

were dedicated by Cadmus. Hence their opinion, whoassert that the Cadmus who came to Thebes was auEgyptian, and not a Phœnician, may be confuted by thevery name given to this statue of Minerva: for this god­dess is called Siga in the Phœnician, and not Sais, as in.the Egyptian tongue.
The Thebans too farther report, that where the forumof the tower now stands, the house of Cadmus formerlystood. Hence, they shew the ruins of the bed-chambersof Harmonia and Semele, into which last, even at present,men are not permitted to enter. According to the Greeks,the Muses celebrated the nuptials of Harmonia with songs:and there is a place in the forum here, where they fay thegoddesses fang. It is also said, that together with thethunder which descended into the chamber of Semele, apiece of wood fell from heaven, which Polydorus adornedwith brass, and called Cadmean Bacchus. Near this thereis a statue of Bacchus, which Onassimedes made entirelyof brass; for the statue of Cadmus was made by the sonsof Praxiteles. Here too there is a statue of Pronomus thepiper, who allured many by his harmony. Before histime there were different pipes, for the Dorian, Lydian,and Phrygian measures; but he sirjl invented pipes adapted toevery kind of harmony, and was the first that played all thedifferent measures at once on one pipe. It is alto said, that hewonderfully delighted the spectators in the theatres, bythe gesticulations of his face, and the motion of his wholebody. His songs are yet extant which he composed forthe Chalcidenses by the Euripus, in honour of Delos. TheThebans therefore have here placed a statue of this Pro-pomus, and of Epaminondas the son of Polymnis.

Page 5. That Adaon might It torn to pieces by hit dogs."] Wehave before (hewn, that a dog was considered by the ancients asthe image of the discriminating and at the same time reprovingpower of the soul. And as Diana, or the moon, is the imageof Nature, she signifies in this fable the natural life, wliich isdivided about the bodies of all animals, and which is the cause toall bodits of augmentation, nutrition, and generation. As astag too is a most lascivious animal, it mull be considered as theimage of a lascivious life. The meaning of the fable, therefore,appears to be this. Actason beholds Diana naked; i. e. hisrational foul converts itself to the natural life which is suspendedfrom its essence, and which subsists in Actseon according to alascivious halit. Hence, by a conversion of this kind, the foulbecomes wholly changed into a lascivious life: and this is themeaning of Action being changed into a stag. But when thisis the cafe, tke rational foul becomes distributed by its discrimi­nating power, considered according to its divisible subsistence inthe senses; for the foul of such a one is wholly engrossed in sen­sible discrimination: and this is the meaning of Actæon beingtorn in pieces by his dogs.

As to the verses which the Greeks call Naupactia, theyare commonly attributed to a Milesian; but Charon theson of Pytheus fays that they were composed by theNaupactian Carcinus: and this is our opinion on the sub­ject. For how can it be reasonable to suppose, that versesupon women, composed by a Milesian, should be calledNaupactian? But in Naupactus there is near the sea atemple of Neptune; and in the temple there is an erectstatue of brass.

But as every gad beginning from on high produces his pro­per series as far as to the last of things, and this series compre­hends many essences different from each other, such as Angelical,Dæmoniacal, Heroical, Nymphical, and the like, the lowest pow­ers of these orders have a great communion and physical sym­pathy with the human race, end contribute to the perfection ofall their natural operations, and particularly to their procreations.As these heroic souls too have a two-fold form of life, viz. epi-nionative and cogitative, the former of which is called by Plato inthe Timæus the circle of difference, and the latter, the circle ofsameness, and which are characterised by the properties of male andfemale ;-*-hence these souls at one time exhibit a deiform power,by energizing according to the masculine prerogative of their na­ture, or the circle of sameness, and at another time according totheir feminine prerogative, or the circle of difference; ytt so,as that according to both these energies they act with rectitude,and without merging themselves in the darkness of body. Theylikewise know the natures prior to their own, and exercise a pro­vidential care over inferior concerns, without at the fame timehaving that propensity to such concerns which is found in thebulk of mankind. But the fouls which act erroneously accordingto the energies of both these circles, or which, in other words,neither exhibit accurate specimens of practical or intellectualvirtue—these differ in no respect from gregarious souls, or theherd of mankind, with whom the circle of sameness is fettered,and the circle of difference sustains all-various fractures anddistortions.
As it is impossible, therefore, that these heroic souls can actwith equal vigour and perfection, according to both these circlesat once, at this is the province of natures more divine than the(human, it is necessary that they must sometimes descend andenergize principally according to their opinionative part, andsometimes according to their more intellectual part. Hence, oneof these circles must energize naturally, and the other be hinder­ed

In the first, place, then, Baptista Porta in his treatise of Natu­ral Magic, relates, that about the year 1550, in the island Nefuin Naples, a marble sepulchre of a certain Roman was discover­ed, upon the opening of which, a phial was found containinga burning lamp. This lamp became extinct on breaking thephial, and exposing the light to the open air. It appeared thatthis lamp had been concealed before the advent of Christ. Thosewho saw the lamp reported, that it emitted a most splendid flame.But the most celebrated is the lamp of Pallas the son of Evander,who was killed by Turnus, as Virgil relates in the tenth book ofhis Æneid.
This was discovered not far from the city of Rome, in theyear 1401, by a countryman, who digging deeper than usual, ob­served a stone sepulchre, containing the body of a man of ex­traordinary size, which was as entire as if recently interred, andwhich had a large wound in the breast. Above the head of thedeceased there was found a lamp burning with perpetual fire,which neither wind nor water, nor any other superinduced liquorcould extinguish: but the lamp being bored in the bottom, andbroke by the importunate enemies of this wonderful light, theflame immediately vanished. That this was the body of Pallas,is evident from the inscription on the tomb, which was atfollows:
Pallas, Evander's son, whom Turnus' spearIn battle slew, of mighty bulk, lies here.
In the Appian Road too, at Rome, in the time of Pope Paulthe Third, a lamp was discovered burning in the sepulchre of Tul-lia the daughter of Cicero, which became extinct on the admis-

designed by this to honour the builder of their city, orwhether they raised this pillar as a mark of honour over asepulchre. They have likewise a temple of Æsculapius,in which there is a statue with a beard. The names .ofthose who made this statue are Timocles and Timarchides;and both of them derived their origin from the Atticland. In the extremity of the city, on the right hand,there are a theatre, and an ancient brazen statue ofMinerva. They fay that this goddess defended themagainst the Barbarians that fought under the commandof Taxilus. The temple too of Minerva Cranæa isabout twenty stadia distant from Elatea. The road tothis temple is rather steep, but its elevation cannot beperceived by those that ascend it. At the end of thisroad there is a hill, which is for the most part steep,but which is neither very bulky nor very lofty. On thetop of this hill is the temple of Minerva; and in it thereare porches, and places of habitation in the porches.Those that minister to the goddess dwell here; and theperson that presides over the sacred concerns in particulartakes up his residence in one of these habitations. Theychoose this person out of the number of beardless youths,and take care that he resigns his office before he has abeard. He performs the office of priest to the goddess forfive continued years; and during all this time he liveswith the goddess, and bathes himself in basons after theancient manner. But the statue of the goddess was madeby the sons of Polycles, and has the appearance of oneprepared for a battle. Her shield too is fashioned in imi­tation of that among the Athenians which is called theshield of the virgin.

But on the fliieldof Menelaus there is a dragon, viz. the one that appearedas an omen during the sacrifice at Aulis. These administerthe oath to Ajax. Opposite to trie horse, NeoptoJemus isbeheld near Nestor, flaying Elassus. This Elassus, whoeverhe was, resembles a man nearly expiring. Neoptolemustoo strikes with his sword Astynous, who has fallen on hisknees, and who is mentioned by Leseheus. Tolygnotus,indeed, is the only one of the Greeks that has representedNeoptolemus still continuing to flay the Trojans; and hisdesign in this was, that the whole picture might cor-*respond to the tomb of Neoptolemus. Homer, indeed,every where calls Neoptolemus the Ion of Achilles; butthe Cyprian verses testify that he was called Pyrrhus byLycomedes, and that the name of Neoptolemus was givento him by Phœnix, because Achilles was very young whenhe first engaged in war.
An altar too is painted here, and a little boy embracingthe altar through fear. On the altar there is a brazencoat of mail. At present the shape of such coats of mailas this is very rare; but they were used in former times.In thi3 coat of mail there are two pieces of brass, one ofwhich serves to fasten it to the breast, and the parts aboutthe belly, and the other defends the back: the anteriorpart of this coat of mail they call gualcti, and the hinderpart prosegon. It appears too to be a sufficient defence forthe body without a shield.

n6 THE DESCRIPTION


ncrva among the Lacedæmonians, which, from its beingbuilt of brass, is called Chalkioicos. Among the Romanstoo there is a forum, which is admirable both for its mag­nitude and ornaments, and which has a brazen roof. Sothat it is not improbable, that there may have been abrazen temple of Apollo. As to the rest, the relations aredoubtless sabulous, either that this temple was built byVulcan, or that golden virgins fang in it, which is assertedby Pindar as follows:
"Suspended from the roof, there golden virgins fang.''
It appears to me, that Pindar invented this fable, in imita­tion of what Homer fays respecting the Sirens. But nei­ther do I find that the fame accounts are given of the de­struction of this temple. Some fay it fell into an openingof the earth; but, according to others, it was destroyed byfire. The fourth temple of Apollo is said to have beenbuilt of stone, by Trophonius and Agamedes: and thiswas burnt when Erxiclides was the Athenian archon, andin the first year of the fifty-eighth Olympiad, in whichDiognetus Crotoniatcs was victor. But the temple whichexists at present was raised by the Aniphictyons out oftheir sacred money ; and its architect was the CorinthianSpintharus.

in it there is an ancient temple of Adonis and Venus.They fay, that in this temple there is a necklace whichwas given by Harmonia at first; but that it came to becalled the necklace of Eriphyle, because she receivedit'as a cist from her husband. Afterwards the sons ofPhegeus dedicated it at Delphi. But how it came to these,we have shewn in our account of the Arcadian affairs.And last of all it was taken away by the Phocæan ty­rants. However, it does not appear to me, that the neck­lace, which the Amathufians possess in the temple ofAdonis, belonged to Eriphyle, as this necklace in Ama-thus is composed of green stones set in gold 5 and Homer,.in the Odyssey, says that the necklace which was given to■Eriphyle was made of gold:
■ "There Eriphyle weeps, who lonselv sold-Hor lorJ, her honour, for the lust of gold."
And yet Homer was not ignorant that there are variouskinds of necklaces. For in the speeches of Eumæus toUlysses, before the arrival of Telemachus from Pylus, thereare the following lines:
"An artist to my father's palace came,"With gold and a:nber chains, elab'rate frame.''
And among the gifts which Penelope received from thesuitors, he fays that Eurymachus gave her a necklace:
A necklace rich with gold, with amber gav,That sliot effulgence like the solar rav,Eurymachus presents.-

Theseforces being assembled at Thermopylæ, as soon as it wasknown that the army of the Gauls had fixed their campsin the borders of Magnesia and Phthiotis, they sent a thou-*sand light-armed soldiers, and a chosen body of horse to theriver Sperchius, that the Barbarians might not pass overthe river without fighting their way, and being exposedto the danger of a defeat. These forces, therefore, whenthey came to the Sperchius, destroyed the bridges whichthe Gauls had raised on it, and fixed their camps on thebanks of the river. Brennus, indeed, was not unskilled inwarlike affairs, but for a Barbarian sufficiently acute, andexperienced in the stratagems of war. On the followingnight, therefore, leaving that part of the river on whichhe had raised the bridges, he sent ten thousand soldiers,who were skilled in swimming, and remarkably tall (forthe Gauls in general surpass other men in stature) to thelower parts of the river, that the Greeks might not per­ceive them as they were passing over-, and besides this,he knew that the river in this part spread itself widelyover the plains, and produced a marsh and lake insteadof a strong and narrow stream.. In the night, therefore,his forces swam over the marshy part of the river, someof them using their shields, which they call thureoi, forrafts, while others, who were taller than the rest, wadedthrough with their feet. The Greeks on the banks of theSperchius, as soon as they understood that the Barbarianshad passed over the marshy part of trie river, immediatelymarched back to their army.

respect to the Tyrrheni is most absurd. For they say,that the Pythian deity having ordered them to engage theTyrrheni with a very small fleet of ships, they on thecontrary drew out against them five three-oared galleys.That the Tyrrheni considering themselves as not inferiorin naval strength and skill to the Leparieans, attackedthem with an equal number of ships. But when theLiparæans took the five galleys of the Tyrrheni, the Tyr­rheni attacked them a second, third, and fourth time withthe like number of vessels. All these however were takenby the Liparæans, who in consequence of this victorysent as many statues of Apollo to Delphos, as the numberof the ships which they had captured amounted to. Eche-cratides, too, a Larissæan, dedicated a small Apollo: andthe Delphi say, that this was dedicated the first of all theofferings.

to its monad preceding dissimilar multitude, it is necessary thateach of these heroic souls should be the leader of other fouls of aninferior rank, but yet resembling their leader in a high degree.Thus Achilles in the Iliad, who, as we have observed in a formercote, is an heroic foul energizing according to practical virtue,stands at the head of a kindred multitude of souls, who, from theirproximity to. such characters as himself, are dignified with theappellation of heroes. Ajax belonged to this kindred multitude,together with Tidydes, Ulysses, and many others; this multi­tude at the fame time possessing gradations of excellence, in orderthat its extremity may coalesce with less elevated fouls. It istherefore by no means wonderful, that Ajax possessed such re­markable strength and magnitude of body, as he belonged tothat class of souls who approximate very near to real heroesamong men.
But a very natural doubt may here arise in the mind of thethinking reader, why Æneas, who is said to have been born of agoddess, as well as Achilles, and of a goddess of a much higherrank than the mother of Achilles, is represented by Homer asengaged in a bad cause, which he evidently is, by fightingfor the Trojans. I answer, that the doubt may be solved, byreading Homer with that profound attention which his poemsso justly demand. For we mail find, that though he calls Æneasa hero, as well as Achilles, from his resembling true heroes inmany respects, yet he plainly evinces that his claim to this cha­racter was not incontrovertible, when he represents Apollo thusspeaking to Æneas: (Iliad. :o. v. 105.)

These sta­tues are Minerva and Apollo; and of the commanders,Miltiades. But of those that are called heroes, Ercchtheus,Cecrops, and Pandion: Celeus likewise, and Antiochusthe son of Hercules, by Midea the daughter of Phylas, ro-. gether with Ægeus •, and of the sons of Theseus, Acamas.These, in consequence of a Delphic oracle/ gave namesto the Athenian tribes. Here too there arc statues ofCodrus the son of Melanthus, Theseus and Phyleus, whowere not ranked among the surnames.

Afterwards they sent Antigonusand his son Demetrius, and the Egyptian Ptolemy, toDelphos; the latter on account of their .benevolencetowards him; and the two former, through fear. Othergifts of the Argives may be seen not far from thishorse, viz. those lenders who together with Polyniceswarred on Thebes; Adrastus the son of Talaus, and Ty-deus the son of Oencus: the grandsons likewise of Proe-tus, together with Capancus the son of Hipponous, andEteocles the son of Iphis: and besides these, Polynices,and Ilippomcdcn who was the son of the sister of Adras­tus.

This they began to put in execution in avery disordered and tumultuous manner, many of themrushing against each other; and many falling into themarsh, and disappearing, absorbed by the mud; so thatthey suffered no less a loss in retreating, than in thevigour of the engagement.
On that day the valour of the Athenians transcendedthat of the other Greeks: and of the Athenians, Cydias,who was quite a youth, and who had never been in an"engagement before, gave specimens of superior courage.This youth being slain by the Gauls, his kindred dedi­cated his shield to Jupiter the Liberator with this in­scription:
"This shield to Jove now sacred, yet desires
The hlooming youth of Cydias fam'd:On his left arm this shield he bravely six'd,
When Mars impetuous tam'd the Gauls."
This inscription remained till the soldiers of Sylla tookthe flueld from the porch of Jupiter the Liberator, toge­ther with other offerings of the Athenians. And suchwas the battle at the Thermopylæ. But on the next daythe Greeks buried their dead, and took away the armourof the Barbarians that fell in the engagement. The Gauls,however, did not demand any truce that they might burytheir dead } and plainly evinced, that they considered it asa matter of no consequence, whether the bodies of theflain were buried in the ground, or torn in. pieces by suchwild beasts and birds, as fight with each other for thebodies of the dead.

having gained this victory, the Phocenses sent gifts to theDolphic Apollo, viz. a statue of the god, and of Tellias whowas at that time the prophet, together with statues of thecommanders and heroes of their own country. And allthese were made by the Argive Aristomedon. The Phocen­ses too after this were not wanting in subtility of invention.For the camps of the enemy once happening to be fixednear the entrance to Phocis, five hundred chosen menof the Phocenses, as soon as the moon had completed herorb, attacked the Thessalians in the night, having rubbedtheir bodies over with plaster, and likewise their armour,which by this means became white. They fay, that atthis time a great slaughter was made of the Thessalians,who thought that what they saw in the night was some­thing divine, and not the result of the enemy's craft. Butit was the Elean Tellias who invented this stratagem,against the Thessalians. When the army too of the Per­sians passed over into Europe, it is said that the Phocenseswere forced to join themselves to Xerxes ; but that after­wards they deserted the party of the Medes, and foughton the side of the Greeks in the battle at Platæa.

The ErithrSfei (for these people contend about Herophilethe most eagerly of all the Greeks) shew a mountain called'Corycus, and in it a cavern, in which they- fay Herophilewas born. They farther add, that her parents were a shep­herd, Theodorus, a native of their country, and a nymphwho was' called Ida: and that the nymph was thus deno­minated, for no other reason than because men at thattime called places thick-planted with trees, Mai. But theErythræi do not rank among the oracles of Herophile, theverse respecting Marpeflus, and the river Aidoneus. OneHyperochus a Cumæan writes, that after Herophile awoman of Cuma belonging to the Opici, used to deliveroracles in the fame manner as Herophile, and that thiswoman was called Demo. >
The Cumæans, however, cannot produce any oraclesof Demo; but they shew a stone water-pot in the templeof Apollo, in which they say the bones of this Sibyl aredeposited. After Demo, the Hebrews beyond Palsestinerank among the number of prophetic women, Sabbe,whose father they say was Berofus, and whose motherwas Erymanthe. Some, however, call this Sibyl a Baby­lonian, and others an Ægyptian. But Phaennis, who wasthe daughter of a man that reigned over the Chaones,and the Peleæ among the Dodonæans, prophesied indeedfrom a divine power, but were not denominated Sibyls.As to the age and oracles of Phaennis, the former maybe known by inquiry, and there is no difficulty in obtain­ing the latter: for she lived in those times in which An-tiochus, having taken Demetrius prisoner, seized on hiskingdom.

placed three Graces in the hands of the god, just alAngelion and Tectæus have done to the Delphic Apollo.And at Athens, in the vestibule of the tower there arethree Graces, whose mysteries, which are kept secret fromthe multitude, are there celebrated. But Pamphus is thefirst we are acquainted with, that celebrated the Gracesin verse : but he neither mentions their number, nor theirnames. Homer too makes mention of the Graces, andfays that one of these is the wife of Vulcan, and that hername is Charis. He also fays, that Sleep is the lover ofthe Grace Pasithea: and in the speech of Sleep, he hasthe following verse:
"That flic my lov'd-one (hall be ever mine,The youngest Grace, Pasithea the divine."
Hence some have suspected that Homer knew os othersnore ancient Graces.
But Hesiod in the Theogony (if that work be the com­position of Hesiod) fays that the Graces are the daughtersof Jupiter and Eurynome, and that their names are Eu-phrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia. Onomacritus, too, in hisverses gives them the fame names. But Antimachus neithermentions the number, nor the names of the Graces, butonly fays, that they are the daughters of Aigle and theSun. Hermesianax the writer os elegies fays, what noone before him ever asserted, that Pitho, or persuasion, isone of the Graces. But I have not been able to find, whothe first person was, that either by a statue or picture re­presented the Graces naked. For the more ancient statuesand pictures of the Graces have garments. Thus amongthe Smyrnxans in the temple of the Nemefcs, among theother statues, there are Graces fashioned of gold, which

made a vow to Apollo, that if by repelling the enemythey were able to free their country from danger, theywould send every day a solemn procession to Delphos,and immolate a certain number of victims. However,after they had conquered the Sicyonians, and in conse­quence of this sent every day a solemn procession to thegod according to their vow, they sound the expence tobe prodigious, and the fatigue attending it greater thanthe cost. Hence, they devised a subtle mode os accom­plishing their vow, and this was by dedicating a brazensacrifice and procession to Apollo. Here too there is arepresentation of the achievement os Hercules respectingthe hydra, which was both dedicated and made by Tisa-goras. As well Hercules as the hydra is of iron. To makestatues indeed of iron, is a thing of the most difficultand laborious nature: but this work of Tifigoras, who­ever he was, is really admirable. In Pergamus likewisethere arc iron heads of a lion and a boar dedicated toBacchus, which demand no small degree of admiration.ThcPhocians that inhabit Elatea, being freed from theliege of their city by Cassander (Olympiodorus, who wassent by the Athenians for this purpose, giving them assist­ance), dedicated to the Delphic Apollo a brazen lion. Butthe statue of Apollo which stands very near this lion, wasmade out of the tenth of the spoils which the Massiliensestook from the Carthaginians, when they vanquished themin a naval engagement. The Ætolians dedicated here atrophy, and a statue of an armed woman (viz. Ætolia);and this out of the money which they took from theGauls, for their cruelty to the Callienses. The goldenjjnage in this temple was dedicated by Gorgias the Leon-tine, and is an image of Gorgias himself.

In this fame public road too there is a place calledTeumeflus, where they fay Europa was concealed by Juspiter. It is likewise said of the Teumeflian fox, that it wasnourished by Bacchus for the purpose of destroying theThebans; and that when it was on the point of being takenby that dog which Diana gave to Procris the daughter ofErechtheus, both the dog and the fox were changed intostones. There is also a temple of Minerva Telchinia inTeumeflus; but it has not a statue of the goddess. Itmay be conjectured, that the goddess was thus denomi­nated from the Telchinians, who formerly dwelt in Cy­prus; for it is probable that a part of them, when theycame among the Bœotians, dedicated this temple of Mi­nerva Telchinia. On proceeding from Teumeflus, on theleft hand, and to the distance of about seven stadia, you willarrive at the ruins of Glifas. Opposite to these there is asepulchre of earth not very large, which can hardly beseen by reason of the trees which surround it, some ofwhich are wild, and others have been raised by art.

Page 7. They report indeed, that the father of Erichthoniut, £^f.]The fables of the ancients are, in their secret meaning, utilityand construction, the most beautiful and admirable pieces of com­position which the mind of man is capable of framing, thoughnothing has been so little understood, or so shamefully abused.Of the truth of this observation, the reader whose mind hasbeen enlightened by true science will be fully convinced by thefollowing explanation drawn from ancient sources of the fablealluded to by Paufanias in this part. Previous to which it willbe proper to observe, that the first cause, according to the Pytha­gorean and Platonic philosophers, on account of his transcendentsimplicity, was called the one, this name being adapted the best ofall others to a nature truly ineffable and unknown. But it isimpossible that such a nature could produce this visible worldwithout mediums, since, if this had been the cafe, all things musthave been like himself, natures ineffable and unknown. It is^neecstary, therefore, that there should be certain mighty powersbetween the first cause and us : for we in reality are nothing morethan the dregs of the universe. These mighty powers, from theirsurpassing similitude to the first god, were very properly calledby the ancients gods; and- were considered by them as perpe­tually subsisting in the most admirable and profound union with .each other, and the first cause; yet so, as amidst this union topreserve their own essence distinct from that of the highest god.Hence, as Froclus beautifully observes, they may be compared totrees rooted in the earth : for as these, by their roots, are unitedwith the earth, and become earthly in an eminent degree Avith*.out being eatth itself; so the gods by their summits are pro­foundly united to the first cause, and by this means are transcen­dency similar to without being the first cause.
But these mighty powers are called by the poets a golden chain,on account of their connection with each other, and incorrup­tible

Page 51. That Ccicjlid! Venus ts the eldest of those divinities whoare called the Parca.~\ We have already observed, that there arctwo Venuses, one supermundane, the other mundane. The first ofthese is the Celestial Venus mentioned in this place by Paufanias,as the eldest of the Parcæ, though according to the Orphic hymnto this goddess, and which I have no doubt is the truth, she isthe ruler of the Fates: for the Hymn fays «u tfastut tjktuwv f*oi£iur,"thou governs/I the three Fates."

Hence Diana is veryproperly represented as a huntress: for through certain unappa-rent powers resident in the rays of the Moon, of which arrowsare an image, she takes away, or, in other words, receives backagain, the natural life which (he gave.

Juno is the inspec-tive guardian of all motion and progression. Hence she is said tohave hurled Vulcan from heaven, because the is the cause of Vul­can's prolific progression to the extremity of things, and of hisbeing every where present with his productions in the most un­restrained manner—-in a manner, by which this progression, con­tinually

supplied them with frefli ones. When any master too fell,one of these servants fought in his stead; and if he like­wise fell, there was a third ready to succeed him. If themaster happened to be wounded, one of his servants im­mediately led him out of the field of battle, and the otherfilled up the place of his wounded master. It appears tome, that the Gauls adopted this plan in imitation of thePersians, who always have in their armies a select band often thousand men whom they call the immortals. Thereis this difference however between the two, that thechosen band among the Persians attacks the enemy in theplace of those that have been slain, aster tlie engagement:but the Gauls order their select company to supply theplace of the dead or wounded during the engagement.This mode of fighting they call in their native tongue,Trimarcisias: for the name of a horse with the Gauls isMarcas. With such preparations, therefore, and with suchconceptions, Brennus marched into Greece.

I will relate all that I have heard. When Orestheus th.9son of Deucalion reigned in this country, a bitch was de­livered of a piece of wood, instead of a whelp. Thispiece of wood Orestheus buried in the ground ; and theyfay, that in the following spring a vine was produced,from it, and that from the wood of its branches (ozci) thepeople were called Ozo/a. Others again fay, that Nessus,who carried the wife of Hercules over the river Evenus,did not immediately die of the wound which he receivedfrom Hercules, but fled to this country j that he diedhere; and that the air became noxious from the filthyodour of his dead body. There is likewise a third report,that a foetid vapour was exhaled from the water of a cer­tain river; and a fourth, that this country abounds withasphodel, and that the smell of it was very predominant.It is also said, that the first inhabitants of this place wereautochthones, or earth-born; and that, in consequence of theirnot having yet learnt to weave garments, they used tocover their bodies, as a defence from the cold, with therecent skins of wild beasts; at the fame time turning thehairy part of the hide outwards for the fake of ornament.And hence the smell of their bodies necessarily resembledthat of the skins. But Aniphifla is about one hundred andtwenty stadia distant from Delphos, and is the largest andmost celebrated city of the Delphi. The inhabitants pfthis city have joined themselves to the Ætolians, in con­sequence of being ashamed of the name of the Ozolæ.Indeed, it is probable that Augustus Cæsar subverted thecountry of the Ætolians, in order to people Nicopolis, andthat he caused a great part of them to migrate to Am-phissa. However, these people originated from the Lo-prians j and their city (as they fay) was denominated from

Bacchus was transmitted to the Libethrians from Thrace,informing them that their city would be destroyed bySus whenever the fun should behold the bones of Or­pheus. The Libethrians, however, did not pay muchattention to the oracle, because they did not believe'that there could be any wild beast sufficiently large andstrong to destroy their city ; and as to the'boar, th?y werepersuaded that its boldness was superior to its strength.However, when it seemed fit to divinity the followingcircumstances took, place: A shepherd about' mid-day,being weary laid himself down by the tonib of Orpheus,and in his sleep began to sing the verses of that poet witha loud and sweet voice. The neighbouring shepherds there­fore and husbandmen, allured by this harmony, left theiremployments, and gathered themselves round the sleep­ing shepherd. But it so happened, from their pushingagainst, and striving to outstrip each other in getting neatthe shepherd, that they overturned the pillar, broke theurn which contained the bones of Orpheus, and by this-means caused them to be seen by the sun. Afterwards,on the following night, divinity caused it to rain in abun­dance; and the river Sus, which is one of the torrents'about Olympus, rushed with such impetuosity against thewalls of the Libethrians, that it threw them down, toge­ther with all the temples and houses, and drowned allthe men and animals that were in the city. The Libe­thrians therefore becoming extinct, the Macedonians thatdwelt in Dios (as a Larissæan, who was my guest, informedme) conveyed the bones of Orpheus to their own country.But those who are conversant with the writings of thepoets, know with respect to the hymns of Orpheus, thateach of them is very short, and that the whole pf them

Depriving Homer of sight.~\ Those who have hap­pily penetrated the profound wisdom of the ancients, will beeasily convinced that the report concerning the blindness ofHomer is merely fabulous, containing some recondite informa­tion, like other divine fables of antiquity. For he is said tohave lost his sig"t through his accusation of Helen. But itwould be ridiculous in the extreme, if we take all that is relatedof Helen in the literal stuse, to suppose that Homer should havebeen deprived of his light for reviling such an infamous woman.Indeed, not only the blindness of Homer il fabulous, but boththe Iliad and Odyssey are to be considered as divine fables. I donot mean to assert by this, that there never was such a war asthe Trojan, or such a person as Ulysses: but it is my opinion,that Humcr, by combining fiction with certain historical facts,has delivered to us some very concealed and valuable informationin these two admirable poems.
That the rape of Helen indeed is fabulous, was the opinion oF120 less a person than Plato, as is evident from the following pas­sage from his Phxdrus: "There is an ancient purification forthose who offend in matters respecting mythology, which Ho­mer

is nearly equal to that brazen statue of Minerva whichthe Athenians dedicated in their tower from the Mara-ithonian spoils. Phidias too made this statue of Minervafor the Platæenfes. In the temple there are picturespainted by Polygnotus, viz. Ulysses destroying the suirtors; and the expedition, prior to this, of Onatas to theArgive Thebes. These pictures are in the vestibule ofthe walls. At the foot of the goddess there is a statue ofArimnestus, who was the general of the Platæenfes inthe engagement against Mardonius; and, prior to this,in the battle at Marathon. Among the Platæenfes toothere is a temple of Ceres Eleufinia, and a sepulchre ofLeitus. This Leitus was the only one of all the Bœotiancommanders, that returned home from the Trojan war.But Mardonius, and the horse which he commanded,corrupted the fountain Gargaphia, because the army of theGreeks which stood opposite to them drank the water ofthis fountain. Afterwards, however, the water was pu­rified by the Platæenfes. As you proceed from Platæa toThebes, you will fee the river Peroe. They fay thatPeroe was the daughter of Asopus. But before you passover the Asopus, on turning by the side of the river tothe lower parts of the country, and travelling to the dis­tance of about forty stadia, you will arrive at the ruins ofScolus. Among these ruins there is an imperfect templeof Ceres and Proserpine, with half statues of the god­desses. Even now the Asopus separates the land of theFlataeenscs from that of the Thebans.

and Panthalis, the latter of whom stands by Helen, andthe former is represented fastening the shoes of her mis-tr.ss. These names too are different from .those which arcadopted by Homer in the Iliad, where he describes Helenand her maids on the walls of Troy. A man clothed inpurple, and extremely sorrowful, sits above Helen: andbefore you read the inscription, you may easily conjecturethat this is Helenus. Near Helenus Meges stands. Hisarm is wounded, agreeably to the account given of himby Lescheus Pyrrhæus, the son of Æschylenus, in his poemon the destruction of Troy. This Lescheus informs us,that he was wounded by the Argive Admetus in thatbattle which the Trojans fought in the night. Lycomedesthe son of Creon stands near Meges. He is representedwounded in the wrist : and, according to Lescheus, he re­ceived this wound from Agenor. It is evident, therefore,thatPolygnotus would not have painted him in this manner,unless he had read the poetical compositions of Lescheus.Lycomedes likewise received two wounds besides this, onein the foot, and the other in the head: and these Poly-gnotus has represented in the picture. Euryalus, too, theson of Mecisteus, appears with two wounds, one in thehead, and the other in the wrist. All these are aboveHelen in the picture. After Helen, Æthra the mother ofTheseus is painted, with her hair (haven off to her skin;together with Demophon the son os Theseus, who is re­presented considering whether it is possible for him tosave Æthra.

To these divini­ties they perform nocturnal sacrifices: and they consumethe flesh os the victims in the place where they^ sacrificebefore the fun rises. Above the city too there is a groveof Neptune; and this they call Poseidonion. In it there isa temple of Neptune ; but it has not at present any statue.These people therefore dwell above Amphissa.
But Oeanthea borders on the sea, and in the neighbour­hood of this city is Naupactus. All the other Locriancities too, except Amphissa, are in subjection to the Pa-trenses, who were invested with this authority by the em­peror Augustus. In this city Oeanthea there is a templeof Venus j and a little above the city there is a grove ofcypress and pine-trees. In this grove there are a templeand statue of Diana. But the paintings on the walls areobliterated by time, so that not one of them remains forinspection. I conjecture, that the city was denominatedfrom a woman or a nymph. For as to what pertains toNaupactus, I know it is reported, that the Dorienses, to­gether with the sons of Aristomachus, built a sleet in thisplace for the purpose of sailing to Peloponnesus; and thatfrom this circumstance the city was denominated. Withrespect to the Naupactians, how the Athenians gave the.Meslenians, who took up their residence inlthome, whenSparta was shaken by an earthquake, Naupactus to in­habit, which they had taken from the Locrians ; and how,after the slaughter of the Athenians at Ægospotamos, theJjaccdxmonians expelled the Messenians from Naupactus

262 NOTES ON THE


as he only considered the sensible Ocean; and Mr. Wood discoverssome sagacity in conjecturing, that Ocean formerly had a differ­ent meaning from what it has at present. For, when Homer callsOcean a river, he alludes to the deity of this name, who belongsto that order of gods which is called intellectual, and of whichSaturn is the summit; who is a fontal deity myeu*; 9to;, andis therefore very properly denominated a river, as giving birthto theprocej/swn of the gods into the sensible universe, and being,according to his last, subsistence, the source of the sea and theall-various streams that flow upon the earth. For every cause isthat primarily, which its effect is secondarily: and hence causeswere assigned by ancient theologists the. fame names with theireffects. Concerning this deity, Proclus in his MSS. Scholia onthe Cratylus observes as follows: "Ocean is the cause to all thegods of acute and vigorous energy, and bounds the distinctionsof the first, middle, and last orders; converting himself to him­self, and to his proper principles, through swiftness of intellect,but moving all things from himself to energies accommodated totheir natures; perfecting their powers, and causing them to pos­sess a never-failing subsistence.'' And in his Commentaries onthe, Timæus, p. 296, he observes of this deity, considered ac­cording to his sublunary subsistence, "that he is the cause ofmotion, progression and power, conferring vigour and prolificabundance on intellectual lives, but swiftness of energy andpurity in generations to fouls, and facility of motion to bodies.That considered as subsisting in tbe gods (i. e. in sublunarygods) he comprehends a motive and providential cause: but inangels he comprehends an unfolding and intellectual swiftness:in dæmons, efficacious power: and in heroes he is the supplieros a magnificent and efficacious life. Besides this, he imparts toevery element the characteristic of his nature. Thus, with re­spect to air, he produces all the mutation of aerial natures, and3s, as Aristotle observes, the cause of the circle of the meteors.

This fame island is likewise freefrom all kinds of poisonous and deadly herbs, exceptingone herb, which resembles parsley, and which, they lay,.causes those who eat it to die laughing. From this circum­stance, Homer first, and others after him, call laughter,which conceals some noxious design, Sardonian. Thisherb is mostly produced about fountains; but yet it doesnot communicate it:; poisonous quality to the water. Andthus much concerning Sardinia, which we havs insertedinto our account os the Phocenfian affairs, because theGreeks have a very inconsiderable knowledge of thisisland.

But they fay, that Ephialtes and Otus consecrated thismountain to the Muses, and were the first that sacrificedto these divinities in Helicon. They likewise report thatAscra was built by these. And Hegesinous, in his poemon the Attic land, thus speaks concerning Ascra:
With Ascra mingling once, th' earth-fliaking power,When rolling years their rounds had run, begatA son nam'd Oeclus, who Ascra built,Assisted by Alotus' offspring, nearThe streams of Helicon's irriguous feet.
I never read the poetical compositions of Hegesinous; forthey were not extant when I was born. But Calippus theCorinthian, in his history of the Orchomenians, cites theverses of Hegesinous in proof of what he asserts: andhence, I have taken these verses from Calippus. At pre­sent a tower remains in Ascra; but of every thing elseeven the remembrance has perished. The sons of Aloeuswere of opinion, that there were only three Muses; andthese they called Melete, Mneme, and Aoide, which signifymeditations memory, and Jinging.

The Ietæ too shew the sepukhreof Homer in the island, and in a separate place the tombof Clymene, who, they say, was the mother of Homer.The Cyprians, however, for they contend that Homer wasborn among them, fay that his mother was Themisto, anative of their country: but Euclus thus prophesies con­cerning his origin: "Then in the sea-girt Cyprus amighty poet shall arise, whom the divine Themiito shallbring forth in the wealthy fields of Salamis. But he de­parting from Cyprus, and sailing on the deep, shall singthe first of all men the calamities of spacious Greece, andshall be himself immortal, and free from the depredationsof age."
This account of Homer I have given in consequenceef what I have heard from others, and from what Ihave read in oracles: for I have written nothingwhichIs the result of my own opinion, either concerning,hiicountry or age. In the temple itself there is an altar ofNeptune, because the most ancient oracle was the pro­perty of this god. There are likewise two statues of theParcæ; but Jupiter Moiragetes, or the leader of the Fates,is dedicated instead of the third of the Parcre A ,r!!oMoiragetes too stands near them.

all possibility of recovering the use of it, in the present life,may be convinced of the truth of the preceding observations, lethim attend to the following information derived from the phi­losophy of Pythagoras and Plato.
There are three orders of fouls which are the perpetual at­tendants of the gods. The first of these orders angels compose;the second, dæmons; and the third, heroes. But as there is novacuum either in incorporeal or corporeal natur.-s, but on thecontrary profound union, it is necessary, in order to accomplishthis, that the last link of a superior order should coalesce with thesummit of one proximately inferior. Hence therefore, betweenessential heroes, who perpetually attend the gods, and are con­sequently impassive and pure, nnd the bulk of human souls whodescend with pasfivity and impurity, it is necessary there shouldbe an order of human souls, who descend with impassivity andpurity. These souls were called by the ancients with great pro­priety Heroes, on account of their high degree of proximity andalliance to such as are essentially Heroes. Hercules, Theseus, Py­thagoras, Plato, &c. were fouls of this kind, who descended intogeneration both to benefit other souls, and in compliance withthat necessity by which all natures inferior to the perpetual at­tendants of the gods are at times obliged to descend. The cha­racteristics of these heroic souls are, grandeur of action, elevation,and magnificence: and Plato in his Laws fays, that we ought toVenerate them, and perform funera! sacrifices in honour of theirmemory. They are too of an undefiled nature when comparedwith other human fouls, than whom they are likewise far moreintellectual. They have much of an elevated nature, and whichis properly liberated from an inclination to matter. Hence theyare easily led back to the intelligible world, in which they livefor many periods; while, on the contrary, the most irrational kindof fouls are either never led back, or this is accomplished withgreat difficulty, or continues for a very inconsiderable period oftime,

arc called Thyades. The faces of all these were made bythe Athenian Praxias the disciple of Calamis. For Praxiasdying before the temple was finished, the remaining partsof the ornaments of the roof were the work of Androf-thenes, who was an Athenian, and the disciple of Eu-cadmus. Golden arms are fixed on the tops of the co­lumns. Of these the Athenians dedicated the shields) inconsequence os the victory which they gained at Mara­thon. The spoilS'of the Gauls which are in the back partof the temple, and on the left hand, were dedicated bythe Ætolians. The form of these shields very much re­sembles that of the wicker-shields of the Persians, whichare called Gerrha.
In our account of the Attic Bouleuterion, we men­tioned the irruption of the Gauls into Greece ; but I havethought proper in this description of the Delphic affairs,to relate the particulars of this irruption more explicitly,because the Greeks, in this engagement against the Bar­barians, exerted themselves in a most eminent degree.The Gauls then marched out of their own dominions thefirst time, under the command of Cambaules; and pro­ceeding as far as to Thrace, had not the boldness to ad­vance beyond it, because they well knew that they werebut few in number, and on this account not able to con­tend with the forces of the Greeks. But when theythought fit to lead a second army beyond their own boun­daries, those that had before followed Cambaules, beingincited by a desire of gain and depredation, of whichthey had now tasted, collected together a great multitudeof foot soldiers, and of horse a considerable number.After this the commanders divided their army into threeparts j and each part was ordered to march into a dif­ferent

among the Phocenses (who enriched themselves the mostof all others, and for the longest time, with the treasuresof the god), and by the army of the Gauls. And last ofall, this temple could not escape the impiety of Nero, whotook away from hence five hundred brazen images, whichwere partly statues of the gods, and partly of men. Theyrelate, that a most ancient contest was established here,which consisted in singing a hymn in honour of Apollo:and that he who first conquered in singing was the CretanChrysothemis, whose father Carmanor is said to have pu­rified Apollo. Philammon was the next that was victo­rious after Chrysothemis ; and Thamyris the son of Phi­lammon conquered after his father. They fay that Or­pheus was unwilling to engage in this contest, by reasonof the dignity of his composition relative to the mysteries,and that elevation of foul which he acquired by his otherproductions; and that Musæus would not engage in it,through his imitation of Orpheus in every respect. Theyfay, too, that Eleuther bore away the Pythian palm,through speaking with a loud.and sweet voice, as he wasnot able to sing the song which he had composed. Theylikewise farther relate, that Hesiod was not permittedto contend, because he had not learned to accompany hisharp with his voice: but that Homer came to Delphos forthe purpose of consulting what was necessary to be done;though even if he had learnt to play on the harp, his artwould have been of no use to him, through the loss ofhis sight. In the third year of the forty-eighth Olympiad,in which Glaucias the Crotonian was victor, the Amphic-tyons instituted games, in which there was singing to theharp as at first; and to which they added singing to thepipe, and playing on the pipe without singing.

ncr, mercenary troops were sent to the Thebans from thePhocenses, and by the Phlegyians from Minyas. An en­gagement therefore taking place nearjfmenus,the Thebanswere vanquished, and fled within their walls. But as thePeloponnefians were unacquainted with the art of be­sieging cities, and attacked the walls of Thebes moreunder the influence of anger than the direction of science,the Thebans flew many of them from their walls, andafterwards leaving their city, by a sudden incursion brokethe enemy's ranks, and cut to pieces the whole army ex­cept Adrastiis. This victory however cost the Thebansdear: and hence, victories obtained with a great loss arecalled Cadmean victories. Not many years after this,those whom the Greeks call Epigonoi, or such as are ofposterior origin, with Thersander for their leader, warredon Thebes. But it is evident, that not only the Argives,Meflenians, and Arcadians, joined themselves to theirstandards, but that the Corinthians and Megarenses cameto their assistance. The Thebans however were assistedby the cities bordering on Thebes; and a sharp engage­ment took place between the two armies near Glisas. Ofthe Thebans, many after they were vanquished fled withLaodamas, and the rest fortified themselves in their city.And this is the war which is celebrated in verse. Ca-lænus, making mention of these verses, fays that they werecomposed by Homer j and many celebrated persons are ofthe fame opinion.

With respect to the prosperous or adverse events ottheir wars, I have found the following to be the mostremarkable particulars. They were vanquished by theAthenians in that battle, in which they assisted the Plstæ-cnses, who fought for the boundaries of their land. Theywere a second time top vanquished at Platæa by the sameAthenians, in consequence of seeming to prefer the friend­ship of Xerxes to that of the Greeks. The commonpeople, however, were not culpable in this particular:for at that time an oligarchy wa9 established among theThebans, and not that form of administration which wasnatural to their country. If therefore the sons of Pisistra-tus had then tyrannized over the Athenians, there can beno doubt but that the Athenians themselves would havebeen attached to the Persians, and on this account wouldhave been culpable as well as the Thebans. Afterwards,however, the Athenians were vanquistied by the Thebanaat Delius, in the country of the Tanagræans: and Hip­pocrates the son of Ariphron who commanded the Athe­nian army was slain, together with a greEt part of his-forces. But the Lacedæmonians, immediately after thedeparture of the Mede, were upon friendly terms withthe Thebans, till the Peloponnesians warred on the Athe­nians. This war however being finished, and the fleet ofthe Athenians dissolved, the Thebans not long after, to­gether with the Corinthians, took up arms against theLacedæmonians: but being vanquished in a battle aboutCorinth, and in Chæronea, they afterwards obtained at

Opposite to thebrazen head of the Bison there is a statue which is in­vested with a coat of mail, and a robe over it. The Delphifay that this was dedicated by the Andrii, and that it isthe statue of Andreus by whom they were colonized.Here too there arc statues of Minerva and Diana, whichwere dedicated by the Phocenses, for having conqueredthe Thessalians their perpetual enemies, and those whoborder on their dominions, except in that part in whichthey are separated from Phocis, by the intervention of theLocrian Hypocnemidii. The Thessalians likewise st Phar-salus, and the Macedonians who inhabit the city DiosundervPieria, and the Grecian Cyrenœans in Libya, havesent sacred offerings to this temple. For these last dedi­cated a chariot, in which Anmon stands: but the Diatædedicated an Apollo laying hold of a stag: and the Phar-salians an Achilles on horseback. The Corinthians too,who are ranked among the Dorienscs, built a treasury:and in this they deposited the gold which they received'from the Lydiani. But the statue of Hercules is the giftof the Thebans, in consequence os that war with thePhocenses which is called sacred.
Here likewise there are brazen images which the Pho­censes dedicated, when in a second engagement they van­quished the Theffalian horse. The Phliasians too sent abrazen Jupiter to Delphos, and together with Jupiter animage of Ægina.

but the other sort, which is white, purifies by acting asan emetic. The Anticyrans likewise have brazen statuesin their forum. In their haven too they have a temple ofNeptune of a moderate size, and which is built of chosenstones. The inward parts are of white plaster. The statuein this temple is of brass, is in an upright position, andstands with one of its feet on a dolphin. One of its handstoo is on its thigh, and with the other it holds a tri­dent. They have besides two gymnasia. One of thesecontains baths; and in the other, which is at some distancefrom this, and is ancient, there is a brazen statue. Theinscription on this statue signifies, that it is the image ofthe pancratiast Xenodamus the Anticyran, who was victo­rious over men in the Olympic games. If this inscriptiontherefore is true, it must follow, that Xenodamus receivedthe olive crown, in the two hundred and eleventh Olym­piad, and that the Eleans have omitted to mention himalone, in their account of the victors in the games. Abovethe forum there is a fountain of water in a well: and aroof supported by pillars screens this well from the fun.A little beyond this well there is a monument raised fromsuch stones as were accidentally found. They fay that thesons of Iphitus are buried in this tomb; that one of thesereturned safe from Troy, and died in his own house; butthat the other, Schedius, fell before Troy, and that hisbones were brought hither.

NOTES ON THE


mome motion to their ruling gods. Hence, when the soul is I*the heavens, they are desirous of uniting it to the divine lifewhich flourishes there. But it is proper that souls living in ge­neration should fail beyond them, like the Homeric Ulysses, thatthey may not be allured by generation, of which the sea is animage. And when souls are in Hades, the Sirens are desirous ofuniting them through intellectual conceptions to Pluto. So thatPlato knew that in the kingdom of Hades there are gods, dæ­mons, and souls, who dance as it were round Pluto, allured bythe Sirens that dwell there."
But here a doubt may very naturally arise in the mind of thereader unskilled in philosophy, how the Sirens, who are divinepowers, can be said to be desirous of connecting souls with gene­ration, which is baneful to the soul. To this I answer, that thealluring power of the Sirens benefits impure souls, by subjectingthem to generation; as their latent guilt is by this means drawnforth, and they are thus prepared for that punishment, whichbeing inflicted for the most benevolent purposes, is in such asthese necessary to the acquisition of a perfect life. But thesedivine natures benefit pure souls by their alluring power, becausethrough this they call forth the virtues of such souls into energy,which would otherwise remain in a dormant state.

Sio NOTES ON THE


this interesting account of the preservation of An'stomenes in thedeep chasm, has been taken from Pausanias with some alterationby the author of those tales, and forms one of the most curiousparts of the history of Sindlad the sailor. A a the Arabians, alittle after the year of Christ 820, under the auspices of the Ca­liph Almaimon, who was the great patron of literature, and in­deed by his orders, translated the best works of the Grecian phi­losophers and mathematicians into Arabic, perhaps Pausaniaswas translated by them at the same time. I only add, that Aristo-menes appears to have been one of those heroes of whom we havegiven an account in a former note.
Page 413. The anger of the Dioscuri.'] We must not supposethat a divine nature is capable of anger, or can be appeased bygifts: for in this cafe it would be subject to pasfion, and influ­enced by delight. But by such expressions as these nothing moreis implied than the effects which vice and virtue produce in ourfouls. For guilt, as Sallust * well observes, prevents us from re­ceiving the illuminations of the gods, and subjects us to the powerof avenging dæmons; and prayers and sacrifices become the re­medies of our vices, and cause us to partake of the goodness ofthe gods. So that it is the fame thing, fays he, to assert thatdivinity is turned from the evil, as to fay that the fun is concealedfrom those who are deprived of sight.

t6 THE DESCRIPTION


Lcuctra a victory the most illustrious of all the Grecia'rfvictories we are acquainted with. Here they put an endto the Decadarchs, or governors of companies, confijling eachof ten men, which the Lacedæmonians had established intheir cities, and to those prefects which they call Har-tno/lai. After this, they carried on for ten years the Pho-cic war, which is called by the Greeks, Sacred. But Ihave already (hewn in my account of the Attic affairs,that the slaughter at Chaeronea was the source of calamityto all Greece: and it was eminently afflictive to theThebans. For they were obliged to place a guard withinthe walls of their city j which, however, after the deathof Philip, and during the reign of Alexander, they droveout of their city. But, for this action, divinity gav.e themtokens of approaching destruction. For, during the timeof the battle at Leuctra, the spiders in the temple of CeresThesmophoros wove white webs about the doors; butwhen Alexander and the Macedonians attacked their do­minions, their webs were found to be black. It is alsosaid, that divinity rained ashes on the Attic land, in theyear prior to that in which Sylla led an army against theAthenians, and by this means caused them to suffer in suchan eminent degree.

THE DESCRIPTION


CHAP. X.
Not far from the gates there is a common sepulchreof those who fell in the engagement against Alexanderand the Macedonians. Near it they shew a place, in whichthey say (if it may be believed) the teeth of the dragonwhich was slain by Cadmus by the fountain were sown,and became men. There is a hill on the right hand ofthe gates, which is sacred to Apollo; and both the hilland the god are called Ismenios, from the river Ismenusslowing near this place. The first stone statues whichpresent themselves to the view on entering the city, arethose of Minerva and Mercury, whom they call Pronaoiyor belonging to vestibules. That of Mercury was made byPhidias, and that of Minerva by Scopas. After this thereis a temple, which contains a statue equal in magnitudeto that of the Branchidre, and in no respect different in itsform. Whoever fees one of these statues, and knows whomit was made by, will, on beholding the other, perceive,without any great skill, that its artificer was Canachus.This statue, however, belonging to the Branchidre is madeof brass, but this of Apollo Ismenios of cedar. In the fameplace too there is a stone, upon which, they fay, Manto thedaughter of Tiresias fat. This stone is placed before thevestibule of the temple, and is called at present the Jeai ofManto.
On the right hand of the temple there are stone statues,which they fay are images of Heniochc and Pyrrha thedaughters of Creon, who reigned while he was the

Patron, incited all those that were capable of bearing armsto rife, and, having vanquished the Macedonians, com­pelled them to abandon the city, and accede to the condi­tions which he proposed. And the Lilæans, in remem­brance of so great a benefit, dedicated his statue atDelphos.
But in Lilæa there are a theatre, a forum, and a bath.There are likewise two temples, one of Apollo, and theother of Diana. The statues in these temples are in an up­right position, were made by Attic artists, and are of Pen-telican stone. They fay that Lilaea was one of the Naiades,that she was the daughter of Cephissus, and that from herthe city was denominated. The fountains of the river arein this place; and the river, rises from the earth, not atall times quietly, but for the most part, and particularlyin the middle of the day, with a loud noise, like the roar­ing of a bull. For three parts of the year, viz. in' spring,summer, and autumn, Lilæa is a temperate region; butthe mountain Parnassus prevents it from being similarlytemperate in winter. A place called Cbaradra, which issituated on a precipice, is about thirty stadia distant fromhence. The inhabitants of this place labour under a greatscarcity of water. The river Charadrus supplies themwith all the water they have; and this river, after run­ning through shelving places, pours itself into the Cephis*sus. It appears to me that the town Charadra was de­nominated from this river. But the Charadrse have twoaltars in the open air sacred to two of those who are calledheroes. Some are of opinion that these heroes are theDioscuri; and others fay that they are heroes belongingto this country. The land too about the Cephissus is byfar the best in all Phocis; and is naturally adapted to the

all possible celerity, yet Damoclidas, Damophilus, aridSimangelus thought this was by no means proper; but ex-«horted the Thebans to fend away their wives and childrento Attica, and prepare themselves for a siege. And afterthis manner six of them varied in opinion. But whenthe seventh of the Bœotian chiefs, who guarded the pas­sages at Cithæron, and whose name was Branchyllides,voted in favour of the opinion of Epaminondas, the The­bans determined to try the fortune of war.
However, several of the Bœotians were suspected byEpaminondas, particularly the Thespians. Fearing there­fore some treachery might ensue, he permitted all thatwere willing to leave the camps, and return home: andin consequence of this permission, the Thespians, andthe other Bœotians, that were not attached to the in­terests of the Thebans, departed from the army. But assoon as an engagement took place, the allies of the Lace­dæmonians, who previous to this were disaffected towardsthem, now openly declared their hatred: for they wereunwilling to remain in their places, and turned their backswhen attacked by the enemy. The battle however betweenthe Lacedæmonians and Thebans was equal; for the formerwere incited by their pristine skill in warlike affairs, and thefear of destroying the dignity of Sparta; but the hitter bythe danger which they saw hung over their country, wivesand children. But when, in the end, many principal per­sons among the Lacedæmonians and king Cleombrotushimself fell, necessity compelled the Lacedæmonians,though in such calamitous circumstances, to maintain theirground; for it appeared to them to be a most shamefulcircumstance, to leave the dead body of their king in thepower of the enemy.

Clipped. With respect to the two temples of Mercufy*one of which is called the temple of Criophoros, or the bearerof the ram, and the other of Pramochos, or the defender,they fay that the first of these was thus denominated, be­cause Mercury freed them from a pestilence, by carryinga ram round the walls; and that on this account Calamismade a statue of Mercury for the Tanagræans, carrying aram on his shoulders. He who surpasses in beauty theother youths, carries, on the festival of Mercury, a ramon his shoulders round the walls. But they fay that Mer­cury was called Promachos, because, when the Eretriensesfrom Eubcca came with a fleet against the Tanagræans,this god led forth the youth to battle, and, being himselfarmed with a curry-comb like a young man, was the prin­cipal cause of putting the Eubceenses to flight. In thetemple of Promachos the remains of a purflain-tree arededicated, because, as they fay, Mercury was educatedunder trees of this kind. Not far too from hence thereis a theatre, and near it a porch is raised. In this parti­cular indeed the Tanagræans appear to me to reverencethe gods in a manner superior to the rest of the Greeks,because they are careful to build their temples separatefrom other edifices, in a pure place, and remote from themultitude.
In a celebrated part of the city there is a sepulchre ofCorinna, who alone composed verses for the Tanagræans.In the gymnasium too there is a picture of her, in whichher head is represented bound with a fillet, on account ofher having vanquished at Thebes, Pindar, in the composingof verses. It appears to me, however, that she vanquishedhtm by reason of the dialect which she employed, becauseter verses were not composed in the Doric dialect like7 those

In that part of Hyam-polis, in which they were informed by their spies theThassalian horse intended to attack them, they dug upcertain earthen urns, aiul, covering them with earth,waited the approach of the enemy. The Thessalians,therefore, being ignorant of the stratagem of the Pho-censes, drove their horses On the urns, whose feet beingby this means either entangled or broken, their riderswere thrown off and cut to pieces by the Phocenses. Butthe Thesialians, in consequence of this, being more enragedwith the Phocenses than before, collected an army fromall their cities, and again attacked the Phocenses, whowere very much terrified, both with the other warlikepreparations of the Thesialians, and particularly with themultitude of their horse, because the Thesialians not onlysurpassed them in the number of their cavalry, but in theart of managing their horses in war.
The PhocenCes therefore sent to Delphos, and enquiredof the god how they might avoid the impending danger.And the messengers brought back the following oracle:*' I fliall cause a mortal and a god to contend with eachother: and I will give the victory to both, and anothervictory to the mortal." Ac soon as the Phocenses receivedthis oracle, they sent thre% hundred chosen men led byGelo against the enemy, and ordered them,as soon as it wasnight, to watch in the most secret manner possible themotions of the Thesialians, to return afterwards to theircamps, and not to engage unless they were forced to it.The whole of this chosen troop, together with its leader,perished, being trampled under foot by the Thessalianhorses, and slain by the enemy.

Nothing can be more absurd than the fable which these versesallude to, if it is considered according to its literal meaning, atthe fame time that it is extremely beautiful when properly un­derstood. In order therefore to understand its secret meaning,it is necessary to remind the reader of what I have before ob­served, that the processions of a divine nature to the extremityof things, according to different orders and degrees, were sym­bolically called, by ancient thcologifls mutations. Hence, byNeptune and Ceres changing themselves, the former into a horse,and the latter into a mare, and from connection with each otherbegetting the horse Arion, nothing more is meant, than that adæmon iacal Neptune and a dxmoniacal Ceres co-operated withthe nat.iral causes by which this animal was produced, in beget­ting him.

But from Stiris to Ambryssus there is a plain roadswhich is about sixty stadia in length. Between the moun­tains here there is a plain : and there are many vines in theplain, and plants called hysgini. Brambles too grow herewithout intermission as well as vines. This bramble theIonians and the rest of the Greeks call coccos, ot the grainwith which scarlet it dyed: but the Gauls above Phrygiacall it in their native tongue Ut. Its magnitude is nearlythe fame with that of the white thorn, but its leaves areblacker and softer than those of the bulrush. In otherrespects, however, it resembles the bulrush. Its fruit itsimilar to that of the solanum or nightshade, and its mag­nitude is equal to that of bitter vetches. In the fruit tooof the coccos a small animal breeds; and this animal, ifit finds a passage to the air when the fruit is ripe, imme­diately takes wing, and exhibits the appearance of a gnat.But now before the animal can be conceived they gatherthe fruit of the coccos. The blood too of this insect is use­ful for the purpose of dying wool. But Ambryssus is situ­ated under mount Parnassus; and the Delphi are beyondit. They fay that the city was denominated from the heroAmbryssus.

In the upper part too of thecity, there is a stadium, which is built of such stone usthe mountain Parnassus abounds with; and this remainedto the time of the Athenian Herodes, who aderned itwith Pentelican stone. And such are the particulars ofthings remaining even at present at Delphos, and whichdeserve to be mentioned. On proceeding from Delphosto the summits of Parnassus, at the distance of aboutsixty stadia, you will fee a brazen statue: and for a mannot heavily clothed, there is a rond here, by which hemay descend either with a mule or a horse to the ca­vern Corycium.

For from hencewe (hall learn, that the properties of the fun are more abun­dantly received by the cock than the lion. And the truth ofthis is evinced from hence, that the cock celebrates, and as itwere invokes the rising sun, by his crowing, as if with certainhymns, when that luminary bends his course from the antipodesto us; and that sometimes solar angels appear in forms of thiskind; and though they are in themselves without form, yet theyappear with it, to us who are connected with figure. Sometimes,too, solar dæmons are seen with a leonine front, who suddenlydisappear when a cock is placed before them. The reason ofthis is, because, in the same order, inferiors always reverence theirsuperiors j just as the greater part of those that behold theimages of divine men, are by the very aspect of these imagesterrified from perpetrating any thing base."

battle the most illustrious victory which one Grecian na­tion ever obtained over another. On the following daythe Lacedæmonians sent heralds to the Thebans, and de­sired they might be permitted to bury their dead. Epami-nondas, however, who knew that the Lacedæmonians al­ways concealed their calamities, answered, that he wouldfirst of all permit their allies to take away their dead, andthen the Lacedæmonians to bury their own people. Assome of the allies, therefore, had not any dead to takeaway, and others had but a few, the Spartans were obligedto confess that the greatest loss was of their own people.In this engagement, of the Thebans and such Bœotians asremained, no more than forty-seven fell; but of the Lace­dæmonians above a thousand.


CHAP. XIV.
After this battle Epaminondas permitted the rest ofthe Peloponnesians to return home, but kept the Lacedæ­monians shut up at Leuctra. But when he heard thatthe Spartans collected themselves together from all theircities in order to assist their own people at Leuctra, hesuffered them to depart on certain conditions, assertingthat it was much better to transfer the war from Bœotia toLacedæmonia. The Thespians, because they suspectedthe Thebans on account of their ancient hatred towardsthem, and their present good fortune, thought proper toleave their city, and fly to Cercssus. This Cercssus is afortified town belonging to the Thespians, into whichthey formerly betook themselves when they were attacked

Hence, Ceres iswith great propriety called bj Plato, mother, and, at the fametime, the supplier of aliment. For, so far as she comprehendsin herself the cause of Juno, (he is a mother; but as containingVesta in her essence, (he is the supplier of aliment. But the pa­radigm of this goddess is Night: for immtrtal Night is called thtnurse if the godt. Night however is the cause of aliment in­telligibly*: for that which is intelligible is, according to theoracles, the aliment of the intellectual orders of gods. ButCeres first of all separates the two kinds of aliment in the gods,as Orpheus fays:

to Asopus: and they fay that one of these gave a name to-a mountain, and the other to a river. It appears too to­me that Platæa, from whom the city was denominatedrwas the daughter of king Asopus, and not of a river.Before the battle which the Athenians fought at Mara­thon, the Platæenses performed nothing which deservesto be recorded. But in this battle they assisted the Athe­nians; and after the irruption of Xerxes into Greece, hadthe boldness to ascend their ships with the Athenians,and punished in their own dominions Mardonius, the sonef Gobryas, who commanded the army of Xerxes. Ithappened, however, that the Platæenses were twice drivenfrom Bœotia, and again restored to it. For in the warbetween the Peloponnesians and Athenians, the Lacedæ­monians besieged and took Platœ*: and when it was re­stored through the peace which Antalcidas, a Spartan,,made between the Greeks and the king of the Persians,,and the Platæenses that had fled to Athens returnedto their na&e/:ctoitatty,\A;wa£:.'uVaan afflicted withdie calamities of.vsar. .

statue of Love for the Thespians; and prior to him Praxi­teles made one of Pentelican stone. With respect to thestratagem which Phryne employed, in order to discoverthe favourite statue of Praxiteles, this I have elsewhererelated. They say, that this statue of Love was first movedout of its place, by the Roman emperor Caius. It wasafterwards sent back to the Thespians by Claudius v andagain brought to Rome by Nero, where it was destroyedby sire. Of those, however, who acted thus impiously to­wards this divinity, one man was slain by a soldier, whomhe used to nick-name in derision; and Nero acted veryimpiously towards his mother, and behaved with a crueltytowards his wives, which shewed that he was entirelydestitute of Love.
But the statue of Love, which is at present among theThespians, was made by the Athenian Menodorus, in imi­tation of the manner of Praxiteles. In this place toothere isa Venus and a statue of Phryr.e, both of stone, andthe works of Praxiteles. In another part of the city thereis a temple of Venus Mclainis, or the black • there a'e be­tides a theatre, and a forum, well worthy of inspection.Here likewise there is a brazen statue of Hefiod: and not farfrom the forum there are a brazen statue of Victory, and atemple of the Muses not very large. In this temple thereare small statues of stone. The Thespians too have a templeof Hercules •, the priestess of which retains her virginity aslong as fiie lives. They fay that this arose from the fol­lowing circumstance: Hercules had connection with allthe fifty daughters of Thestius except one, in one night:and this one, who was unwilling to be connected withhim, was chosen by him as his priestess, but with this re*ILrictioUj that flie should rernain all her life a virgin.

no care to acquire wealth, and thiff in consequence of anoracle, which declared, that the desire of riches wouldbe the only thing destructive to Sparta, Lyfander inflamedthem with a vehement desire of becoming rich. Hence,following the opinion of the Persians, and judging accord­ing to their law, I conclude that Lyfander was more hurt-ful than useful to the Lacedæmonians.


CHAP. XXXIII.
But in Haliartus there is a sepulchre of Lyfander, andan heroic monument of Cecrops the son of Pandion. Themountain too, Tilphussius, and the fountain Tilphussa,are about fifty stadia distant from Haliartus. It is said bythe Greeks, that when the Argives together with the sonsof Polynices took Thebes, as they were leading along theprophet Tiresias, with their other spoils, to the DelphicApollo, the prophet being thirsty by the way drank of thefountain Tilphufla, and immediately after expired. Hissepulchre therefore is near this fountain. They fay, too,that Manto the daughter of Tiresias was given to Apolloby the Argives; but that by order of the god she parsedover in a stiip to Colophon in Ionia, and there marriedRhacius the Cretan. With respect to other particularsabout Tiresias, such as the number of years which helived, his being changed from a man into a woman, andwhat Homer asserts of him in the Odyssey, that he was theonly wife person in Hades—these are known to every one.Among the Haliartians too there is in the open air atemple of those goddesses who are called Praxidicai, or, the

BrENNUS after this ordered the inhabitants nearthe bay of Maliacus to join the Sperchius by a' bridge-This they accomplished with great celerity, both throughfear of Brcnnus, and through the desire os hastening thedeparture of the Barbarians, as there was reason to ex­pect they would greatly injure them if they staid longin these parts. Brennus, therefore, as soon as he hadpassed over the river by bridges, led his army to Heraclea,depopulated the country, and flew the men that he found,in the fields. He did not however take the city, becausein the year prior to this event, the Ætolians compelledthe Heracleotæ to become a part of their dominions, andin consequence of this defended their city at that timewith great alacrity, considering it as a place which be­longed to themselves as much as to the Heracleotse. ButBrennus did not bestow, much pains in endeavouring totake this city, but employed himself principally in takingcare to prevent those who guarded the walls of Heraclea,from hindering his march to that part of Greece whichis -within Thermopylæ. Leaving therefore Heraclea, andlearning from certain fugitives the number of the forceswhich had assembled from the several cities of Greece,he despised the Grecian army, and determined to cometo an engagement on the following day at sun-rise;neither employing any Grecian prophet, nor performing any of •the sacred ceremonies of his own country, if, indeed, theGauls knew any thing of. the divining art.

sot THE DESCRIPTION


this part of the country, at the distance of about eightystadia from Amphiclea, you will arrive at Drymæa, ac­cording to the information of Herodotus. The inhabitantsof this place were formerly called Naubolenscs; and theyfay that their city was built by Phocus the son of Æacus.But the Drymaji have an ancient temple of Ceres Thesmo-phsros, or the legislative deity. In this temple there is astatue in an upright position j and they celebrate an an­nual festival in honour of the goddess.


G H A P. XXXIV.
Of all the cities too in Phocis except Delphos, Elateais the greatest. This city is situated opposite to Amphiclea,and is distant from it about one hundred and eighty stadia.The greater part of this road is a plain : but near the wallsof Elatæa it has a gradual elevation. Through the flatpart of the road the river Cephissus slows; and the birdscalled Otides feed on its banks. The Elatæans defendedthemselves against, and repelled the army of the Mace­donians led by Cassander. They likewise fled from Taxilus,who commanded the army of Mithridates: and for thisthe Romans gave them their freedom, and suffered themto cultivate their land without paying tribute. There is adispute concerning their origin: but they assert of them­selves, that they were formerly Arcadians. For they faythat Elatus the son of Areas, when the Phlegyans attackedDelphos, fought in defence of the god, and afterwardstook up his residence together with his forces in Phocis,and built the city Elatea.

They pay no regard to the former entrails, eventhough they should be favourable, unless the entrails ofthis ram are likewise auspicious. And when it happensthat the entrails thus correspond in signification, then theperson that wishes to consult Trophonius descends withgood hope, and in the following manner: The facrificersbring him by night to the river Hercyna; there theyanoint him with oil; and two boys belonging to the city,each about thirteen years old, and whom they call Mer­curies, wash him, and supply him with every thing ne­cessary.
He is not immediately after this led by the facrificersto the oracle, but is first brought to the fountains of theriver, which are very near to each other. Here he isobliged to drink of that which is called the water of Lethe,that he may become oblivious of all the former objects ofhis pursuit. Afterwards he must drink of another water,which is called the water of Mnemosyne, or memory, thathe may remember the objects which will .present them­selves to his view on descending into the grove. Havingtherefore beheld the statue, which they say was made byDædalus (and which the priests never shew to any butthose who desire to consult Trophonius), performed cer­tain religious ceremonies, and prayed, he proceeds to theoracle clothed in white linen, begirt with fillets, andhaving on his feet such flippers as arc worn by the na­

and by this means destroyed himself j and all that fol­lowed him were punished by the Amphictyons with thefame kind of death. After the death of Philomelus thePhocenfes gave the government to Onomarchus t but Philipthe son of Amyntas joined himself to theThebans, and inthe engagement which ensued vanquished the enemy.Onomarchus therefore flying to the sea, was pierced todeath by the arrows of his own soldiers, who accused histimidity and ignorance in war, as the causes of theirhaving been vanquished. And such was the end whichthe Dæmon gave to die life of Onomarchus. The Pho­cenfes, after this, invested his brother Phayllus with thesupreme authority. But he had scarcely begun his reign,when he saw the following vision in a dream : Among thegifts sacred to Apollo there was an ancient brazen imageof a man, whose flesh had been consumed by disease, andwhose bones alone remained. The Delphi fay that this wasdedicated by Hippocrates the physician. Phayllus in adream saw himself resembling this image; and immedi­ately after was seized with a tabid disease, which folfilledthe prediction os his dream. In consequence of this event, taking place, the supreme authority was given to Pha-læcus the son of Phayllus; but he lost his kingdomthrough appropriating the sacred wealth to his own pri­vate purposes. After this he sailed to Crete with suchof the Phocenfes as embraced his party, and besieged witha band of mercenary troops the city Cydonia, because theinhabitants would not pay him the money which'he de­manded. He lost however in this siege a great part ofhis army, and was himself slain.

NOTES ON THE


such as lire in generation are said to be placed under Neptune.And those which after generation are purified and punished, andeither wander under the earth for a thousand years, or again re­turn to their principle, are said to live under Pluto. In the fifthplace, the distributions of these gods are divided according to thecentres of the universe. For Jupiter possesses the oriental centre,as being allotted an order correspondent to that of fire: but Nep­tune obtains the middle centre, which corresponds to a vivific na­ture, and through which generation enjoys celestial natures: andPluto obtains the western centre ; since the west is allied to earth,because it is nocturnal, and the cause of obscurity and darkness.For shade proceeds from the earth, and earth is the privation oflight from west to east. Lastly, according to every division of theuniverse, such natures as arefirst, and obtain the principality, belongto Jove; such as are middle correspond to the kingdom of Neptune;aud such ai are last belong to the empire os Pluto."'
Page 141. Mercury in a fitting posture, and by thefide of him aram.~] The reason why Mercury was represented by the ancientswith a ram, depends on the intimate alliance of this god with Mi­nerva, who, as we are informed by Proclus on the Timæus, pre­sides over that celestial constellation called the ram, and fromthence imparts a motive power which governs the universe. Butthe agreement of Minerva with Mercury will be obvious fromconsidering that this goddess, as we have before observed, extendsthe whole of intelb.ilual light, and that Mercury is the source ofthe reasoning power. Hence the ancients used to render the statuesof both these divinities one, by joining them together: and astatue of this kind they called f.;na8i»i), Hermathena, or Mercury-Minerva. These Hermathena: are mentioned by Cicero in hisbooks De Inventione. I only add, that the verses of Homer citedby Pausanias may be sound Iliad 14. v. 490.

likewise brought statues to Delphos, viz. Triopas, whobuilt Gnidus, standing by a horse; Latona, Apollo, andDiana, piercing Tityus with their arrows, whose body isrepresented wounded. These stood near the treasury ofthe Sicyonians. The Siphnii too made a treasury on thefollowing account. The island Siphnos had gold-mines ,and they were ordered by Apollo to fend a tenth of theproduce of these mines to Delphos; in consequence ofwhich they built a treasury, and sent with it a tenth ofthe produce of their mines. Afterwards, however, throughtheir immoderate desire of accumulating wealth, they ne­glected to send the tenth of their riches to Delphos; andin consequence of this their gold mines were destroyedby an inundation of the sea. The Liparæi likewise havededicated statues here for a naval victory, which theygained over the Tyrrheni. These Liparæi were a colonyof Gnidians, who, as we are informed by the SyracufahAntiochus the son of Xenophancs, in his Sicilian history,were colonized by a Gnidian, whose name was Pentathlus.This historian adds, that the Gnidians being driven fromthat city which they had built at Pachynum, a promon­tory of Sicily, by the Elynii and Phœnicians, either tookpossession of desert islands, or drove the inhabitants outof the islands on which they landed: and these, in con­formity to the verses of Homer, they call at present theislands of Æolus. In Lipara, one of these islands, theybuilt a city: but they sailed to Hiera, Strongyle, andJDidymæ, for the purpose of cultivating the land in thesoplaces.

Upon •which they say Apollo laid hit harp."] As thecharacteristics of all the divine orders are participated by the lastof things, hence a vestige of supernal light is not only visible inplants, but in particular stones. Thus, as Proclus observes inhis small treatise Dc Magia, "the sun-stone by its golden rayaimitates those of the sun; but the stone called the eye of heaven,or of the sun, has a figure similar to the pupil of an eye, and aray shines from the middle of the pupil. Thus too the lunartysone, which has a figure similar to the moon when horned, by acertain change of itself, follows the lunar motion. And the stonecalled Iselioselenus, i. e. of the fun and moon, imitates after a man­ner the congress of those luminaries, which it images by its co­lour." This being the cafe, it is by no means wonderful, thatthere should be certain stones which possess a debile vestige ofthe divine harmony of Apollo: and the stone mentioned by Pau-sanias, from its being one of this kind, may have occasioned thefabulous report, that Apollo laid his harp on it.

They farther add, that prophecy by the flight ofbirds was invented by this Parnassus; but that the citywhich he built was destroyed by the rain which fell inthe times of Deucalion: that such men as were able tofly from the storm, followed the howlings of wolves, and,with wild beasts for their guides, escaped to the summitsof Parnassus •, and that from this circumstance they calledthe city which they built there, Lycorea. There is like­wise another report different from this, that Lycorus wasthe son of Apollo by the nymph Corycia; that from himthe city was called Lycorea: but that the cavern was de­nominated Coryciun* from the nymph. It is also said,that Celæno was the daughter of Hyamus the son of Ly­corus; and that Apollo had by her a son Delphos, fromwhom the present name of the city was derived. Othersagain fay, that one Castalius, a native of this city, had adaughter whose name was Thyia, and who was the firstthat officiated as priestess to Bacchus, and celebrated theorgies of the god. That from her, those afterwards thatwere agitated with Bacchic fury came to be called Thyiadai.Hence, they are of opinion that Delphos was the son ofApollo and Thyia. But, according to others, his motherwas Melæne the daughter of Cephissus.
Some time after this, not only the neighbouring peoplecalled the city Delphos, but likewise Pytho, as is evidentfrom the verses of Homer, in his catalogue of the Pho-censes.

held the image of this coat of mail in the picture ofPolygnotus And in the temple of Ephesian Diana, Cal-liphon the Samian has painted certain women adaptingthe hollow parts of a coat of mail to Patroclus. Polygnotuslikewise has painted in this picture Laodice standing be­yond the altar. I do not know of any poet that hasmentioned her among the Trojan captives; and it ap­pears to me very probable that she was dismissed by theGreeks. Homer, indeed, in the Iliad, evinces that Mene-laus and Ulysses were entertained by Antenor, and thatLaodice was married to Helicaon the son of Antenor.Lescheus asserts, that Helicaon being wounded in the noc­turnal engagement, was known by Ulysses, and freed fromthe danger of the fight. It may therefore be easily be­lieved, that neither Agamemnon nor Menelaus would actin an hostile manner towards the wife of Helicaon. How­ever, Eupherion Chalcidensis asserts things respectingLaodice, which are utterly void of probability. AsterLaodice there is a stone prop, on which there is a brazenlaver. Medusa sits on the ground, holding this prop with■both her hands. Any one may rank Medusa among thedaughters of Priam, who has read the ode of Himeraeus.Near Medusa there is an eld woman with her hair shaven,to the skin; or perhaps this may be an eunuch. Sheholds a naked infant on her knees: and the infant is re­presented hcjding his hand before his eyes, through fear.

The artificers of all these were Hypatodorusand Aristogiton: and they fay that the Argives dedicatedthem out of the spoils of the victory, which, through theassistance of the Athenians, they gained over the Lacedæ­monians in Oenoe, an Argive city. It appears to me too,that the Argives dedicated out of the fame spoils theimages of those who are called by the Greeks Epigonoi,or posterior sons. For statues of these are placed here, viz.Sthenelus,and Alcmæon, who in my opinion was honouredabove Amphilocus, on account of his age. To these areadded, Promachus, Thersander, Ægialeus, and Diomed.Euryalus too stands between Diomed and Ægialeus.
Opposite to these there are other statues, which werededicated by the Argives, when they assisted Epami-nondas the Theban general in restoring the Messenians.There are likewise images here of heroes, viz. king Da-naus, who arrived at the highest degree of power andwealth in Argos: Hypermnestra, because she was the only■one of his daughters that had pure hands: and near herLynccus, and all those who derive their origin from Her­cules, and still higher from Perseus. There are besidesbrazen horses of the Tarentines, and captive women,which the Tarentines sent in consequence of having con­quered the Mcssapians, who are a barbarous nation bor­dering on the Tarentines: and these are the works ofthe Argive Ageladas.

Afterwards the Em­peror Augustus was willing that the Nicopolitans atActium should likewise partake of this assembly. Hetherefore ordered the Magnetæ, Maleenses, Ænianæ, andPhthiotx, to join themselves to the Thessalians; andtransferred the suffrages of these people and the Dolopiansto the Nicopolitans. The Amphictyons in my time werethirty in number. Nicopolis, Macedonia, and the Thes­salians, had each of them two. Among the Bœotians(for these formerly were a part of Thessaly, and werecalled the Æolenses) there were two. So likewise thePhocenses and the Delphi had each of them two; and theancient Doric land had one.

beg pardon for the deed. When therefore he drove to the*island Leucophrys, and had fastened his vessel either to astone or a trunk of a tree, Tennes, impelled by anger, flewhim with a battle-ax. And hence it came to be a proverbialsaying, when any one resolutely denied complying withthe request os another, that he cut him down with a Te-nedian battle-ax. The Greeks fay that Tennes was flaistby Achilles, as he was making depredations on this island.But the Tenedii in process of time joined themselves tothe Trojan Alexandreans, through the imbecility of theiraffairs.
The Greeks too, who warred against the Persians, de­dicated in Olympia a brazen Jupiter, and in Delphos anApollo, for the naval victory which they obtained at Ar-temisium and Salamis. It is also said, that Themistocles,when he came to Delphos, dedicated to Apollo the spoiltof the Medes; and that, on his inquiring whether hemight place these gifts within the temple, the Pythianpriestess ordered him to carry them entirely away fromthe temple. But the oracle which flie gave him respect­ing this was as follows: •* Place not in my temple thebeautiful spoils of the Persians, but swiftly carry them toyour own habitation." It is certainly a wonderful cir­cumstance, that the god should alone reject the spoils ofthe Medes which were presented by Themistocles. Seme,however, are of opinion, that all the Persian spoils wouldhave been rejected, if, like Themistocles, they had first in­terrogated Apollo whether he would accept them. Othersagain fay, that^ as Apollo foreknew Themistocles wouldbecome a suppliant to the Persians, he was unwilling toreceive their spoils, lest the Persians through hatred of thedonor sliould reject his supplications.

BuT the battle-axes which are dedicated here were thegift of Periclytus the son of Euthymachus the Tcnedian.An ancient story assigns the reason of their being dedi­cated. This story informs us, that Cycnus was the sonof Neptune, and that he reigned in Colonæ, a Trojantown which is situated near the island Leucophrys. ThisCycnus had a daughter whose name was Hemithea, anda son named Tennes, by Proclea the daughter of Clytius,and the sister of Caletor, who, as we are informed byHomer in the Iliad, was slain by Ajax, because he broughtfire to the soip of Protesilaus. On the death of Proclea,Cycnus married Philonome the daughter of Craugasus,who falling in love with her son-in-law Tennes, and beingrepulsed by him, falsely accused him to her husband of en­deavouring to have connection with her against her wilLCycnus becoming the dupe of her deception, shut upTennes and his sister in a chest, and threw them into thesea. They were, however, carried with safety to the islandLeucophrys, which is now denominated Tenedos fromTennes. But Cycnus, having in process of time discoveredthe fraudulent conduct of his wife, failed in search of hisson, in order that he might justify himself by pleading inhis defence that he was ignorant of his wife's artifice, and

nymph Tithorea, who was one of those nymphs that, ac­cording to the ancient poets, are produced from othertrees, and particularly from oaks. But the affairs of theTithoreans, one age prior to mine, were changed by thedæmon to a worse condition. At present, however, theapparatus of a theatre, and the inclosure of a more an­cient forum, remain. The particulars in the city, whichmostly deserve to be mentioned, are a grove, temple, andstatue of Minerva; and a monument in remembrance ofAntiope and Phocus. In my account of the affairs of theThebans, I mentioned the insanity of Antiope, throughthe anger of Bacchus, and on what account she becamethe victim of divine anger. I shewed too in the sameplace, that she was married to Phocus the son of Orny-tion, and was buried with him : and besides this, I indi­cated what the oracle of Bacis asserted, both concerningthis sepulchre, and that of Zethus and Amphion amongthe Thebans. And such are the particulars which de­serve to be mentioned in this town; for there are not anybesides these. A river runs near the city of Tithorea;and the inhabitants of the city descend to its banks, anddraw water from it. The name of the river is Cachales.The temple of Æsculapius is about eighty stadia distantfrom Tithorea: and they call this god Archagetas, or theprimæval divinity. He is honoured by the Tithoreans,and by the rest of the Phocenfes. Within the inclosurethere are habitations for suppliants and the servants of thegod: but in the middle of it there is a temple, and a stonestatue which has a beard, and is about two feet in altitude.On the right hand of the statue there is a bed. They areof opinion that they ought to sacrifice all kinds of yictimsto the god, except goats. At the distance of about forty

water os Castalia, which is sweet to the taste. They saythat a woman, a native of this place, gave a name to thefountain; but some are of opinion, that it was denomi­nated by a man whose name was Castalius. Panyashs,however, the son of Polyarchus, fays, in the verses whichhe composed on Hercules, that Castalia was the daughterof Achelous. For thus he speaks concerning Hercules:
"With rapid sect, Parnassus' snow v topHe left behind, and to Castalia-!. streamImmortal AchcIouV daughter came.''
I have likewise heard it asserted, that this water of Cas­talia is the gift of the river Cephissus. AIcxus indeedfays this, in the introduction of his hymn to Apollo: andthis is confirmed by the Lilæenses, who report, thatwhen, on stated days, they throw into the fountain ofCephissus cattle belonging to their country, and otherthings according to established rites, they are again seenin the river Castalia. The city of the Delphi in everypart rises to a steep: and the sacred inclosure of Apollohas the fame situation with the city. This temple is verylarge, and stands in the upper part of the city: and pas­sages in a continued series cut one another through thetemple.

NOTES ON THE


A dragon, too, is very properly considered as one of the symbolsbelonging to this goddess. For, as we have before observed, tbiianimal signifies the partial life of the foul, or, in other words,the condition of its intellect when separated from diif'me intelltBs:and it is the province of Minerva, as we are informed by Proclus,to establish all partial intellects, in the universal intellect of Jupiter.
With respect to Pandora, it is well known that, according tothe fable, (he was a woman made out of earth by Vulcan, at thecommand of Jupiter, in order to take vengeance on Prometheusfor having stolen fire from heaven; that she was adotned by eachgod with some particular gift; and that stie was afterwards sentby Jupiter to Epimetheus the brother of Prometheus with a boxfull of all-various evils. The recondite meaning however of thisfable is, I fear, at present perfectly unknown; and therefore 1shall present the reader with the following beautiful explanationof it from the MS. Scholia of Olympiodorus on the Gorgias ofPlato:—" Prometheus is the infpective guardian of the descent oflational souls: for to exert a providential energy is the employ­ment of the rational foul, and prior to any thing else, to knowitself. Irrational natures indeed perceive through percuffion,and prior to impulsion know nothing: but the rational nature isable, prior to information siom another, to know what is use­ful. Hence F.pimetbeut is the infpective .guardian of theirrational foul, because it knows through percuffion, and notprior to it. Prometheus, therefore, is that power which presidesover the descent of rational souls. But Jire signifies the rationalsoul itself; because, as sire tends upwards, so the rational soulpursues things on high. But you will fay, Why is this fire said tohave been stolen? I answer, That which is stolen is transferredfrom its proper place to one that is foreign. Since, therefore,the rational soul is sent from its proper place of abode on high,to earth as to a foreign region, on this account the fire is said tobe stolen. But why was it concealed in a reed? Because a reedis cavernous like a conduit pipe (afftyysijijf), and therefore sig­

ThEY say that the first inhabitants of Thebes werethe Ectenæ, whose king was Ogygus, a native of the place;and from whom many of the poets call Thebes Ogygise.They add, that these people were destroyed by a pestilence;and that the Hyantes and Aones, who, as it appears tome, were Bœotians and not foreigners, inhabited Thebesafter the Ectenæ. But Cadmus and the army of the Phœ­nicians attacking these places, the Hyantes were van­quished, and fled the following night. Cadmus howeversuffered the Aones, who implored his protection, to re­main, and mingle themselves with the Phœnicians. TheAones therefore fixed their habitations in different towns;but Cvlmus built the city, which is even at present called•Cadmca. The city, however, being afterwards increased,Cadmea became the tower of the lower Thebes. The mar­riage of Cadmus was certainly very illustrious, if, accordingto the assertion os the Greeks, he married Harmony, thedaughter of Venus and Mars. His daughters too wererenowned; for Semele was pregnanf from Jupiter, andlno was made one of the divinities of the sea. But duringthe reign of Cadmus, the Spartans, Cthonios, Hyperenor,Pelorus, and Udæus, were very powerful through hi$means. For Cadmus thought proper to make Echion hisson-in-law, on account of his valour: and with respectto these men, as I cannot gain any farther intelligenceabout them, I must assent to the fable, which fays, thatthey were called Spartans, from the manner in which theywere produced.

So likewise Virgil, in his 4th Æneid, describes this uriJufua,or advent of Apollo:
As when from Lycia, bound in wintry frost,
Where Xanthus'streams enrich the smiling coast,
Vbe beauteous Pbabus in bigb pomp retires,
And bears in Delos the triumphant choirs,
The Cretan crowds and Dryopes advance,
And painted Scythians round his altars dance:
Fair wreaths of vivid rays his head infold,
His locks bound backward, and adorn'd with gold;
The god majestic moves o'er Cynthus' brows,
His golden quiver rattling as he goes.

The adytum too of temples was the place in which the divi­nities appeared to the eyes of such as were properly prepared forso transcendent a vision, as the following passage from Plotinujevinces (Ennead. 9. lib. ix. p. 770.).—wbttij t»{ h; to ho-u t*u aJu-T*», uc tHwiau vnzaXsicm ta itra »ia ayaXpxTa, £ ijiktun tov aJ«-t«i/ zuAtr ymrai waata fxna to i»Io» Siapa, kJ tuv ikii avmvtrutr, ~.-o;an ayeApa tfi' u-owt, «»' utif>. i. e. "Just as one who havingentered into the most interior parts of the adytum of a temple,leaves all the statues in the temple behind him (which on his de»pasture from the adytum will first present themselves to his viewafter the inward spectacle), and then associates not with a statueor an image, but with the thing itself; viz. with a divine nature."From all which the truth of what Pscllus asserts, in the passagealready cited from his book On Dæmons, " that magic formed thelast part of the jtictrdotal oJJHcc among the Greek* " is I presumeperfectly apparent.

and thus destroy as much as possible its very essence. But hewho, like Oedipus, is able to solve the ænigmas of the Sphinx,or, in other words, to comprehend the dark essence of his phan­tasy, will, by illuminating its obscurity with the light of in­tellect, cause it, by becoming lucid throughout, to be no longerwhat it was before.
Hence we may fee the propriety of the Egyptians placing aSphinx in the vestibule of the temple of Isis, who is the fame withMinerva. For what the phantasy is in the microcosm man, thatMther is in the universe. But opinion may be called the vestibuleof the rational soul, and the rational soul is as it were the templeof that intellectual illumination which proceeds from Minerva.In this vestibule therefore the phantasy is seated. And in a similarmanner æther is seated in the vestibule of that divine soul, whichis suspended from the deity of Minerva, and which may be calledher temple. So that æther is the Sphinx of the universe.

Ishall only add at present from Simplicius De Cœlo, p. 147,"that Hesiod, when he sings.
Chaos of all tilings was the first pratluc'd,
insinuates that there was something prior to Chaos, from whichChaos was produced. For it is always necessary that everything which is generated should be generated from something.But this likewise is insinuated by Hesiod, that the first cause itabove all knowledge and every appellation."

were so artificially placed about the temple, that by striking oneof them the sound was communicated to all the rest. Accordingto Menander, if a man touched them but once they would con­tinue ringing the whole day.
But it appear! to me, that the reason why brass was dedicatedin particular to Dodonean Jupiter, is because this deity subsistsaccording to a terrestrial characteristic; and brass, as we learnfrom Proclus, is a symbol of a resisting solid, or of earth. Forearth receives the illuminations of all the gods. "And hence(fays Proclus in Tim. p. 282) there are a terrestrial Ceres,Vesta, and Isis, as likewise a terrestrial Jupiter and a terrestrialHermes, established about the one divinity of the earth; just as amultitude of celestial gods proceeds about the one divinity of theheavens. For there are progrejfiont os all the celestial gods Into theearth; and earth contains all things In an earthly manner, whichheaven comprehends celestially. Hence we speak of a terrestrialBacchus and a terrestrial Apollo, who bestows the all-variousstreams of water with which the earth abounds, and openingsprophetic of futurity." Brass indeed was employed by the an­cients, as we learn from the Scholiast on Theocritus (Eidyl. 2),'in all consecrations and expiations, because they considered it assomething pure, and endued with a power of expelling pollutions.And Eustathius upon this line in the 18th book of the Iliad,

Forth from the deep with line and vocal Irajt^

And the Pythagoreansfay, that brass accords with every diviner spirit; ar.d hence a tri­pod formed from this metal is dedicated to Apollo. Often toowhen the air is perfectly tranquil, and every thing else is still,hollow kettles will appear to be as it were shaken.".

OF GREECE. 61


I have heard another account of this affair, that Herculeswas connected with all the fifty daughters of Thestius inone night, that they all bore him sons, and the youngestand oldest of these daughters were each of them de­livered of twins. However, for my own part, I cannever be induced to believe, that Hercules could beexcited to such a violent anger against the daughter ofhis friend. Besides, it is not probable, that he who, whilehe was among men, punilhed the insolent behaviour osothers, and particularly revenged impiety towards thegods, would build a temple, and appoint a priestess forhimself as if he was a god. But to me, indeed, it appears,that this temple is more ancient than the period in whichHercules the son of Amphitryon lived: and I do notknow, whether the dedication of this temple ought notto be ascribed to the Hercules who is one of the IdxiDactyli, as I have discovered that the Erythræans in Ionia,and the Tyrians have raised temples to him. Nor are theBœotians ignorant of this name of Hercules; for theyfay, that the temple of Mycaleflian Ceres was committedto the care of the Idxan Hercules.

CHAP. XL.
T*H E Bœotians became acquainted with this oracle, ofwhich they were before entirely ignorant, by the follow­ing means: In consequence of a great want of rain forthe space of two years, they sent Speculators from eachcity to Delphos: These, imploring a remedy against, thedrought which they laboured under, the Pythian deityordered to go to Trophonius in Lebaderij and find relieffrom him. But when they came to Lebadea, and couldnot find the oracle, one Saon an Acraiphnian, who waSthe oldest of the Speculators, happened to fee a swarmof bees, and followed them to their hive. Perceiving,therefore, that they flew into this chasm of the earth, hefollowed them, and by this means found the oracle whichhe sought. They say, that this Saon was instructed byTrophonius in all the sacred ceremonies belonging to thisoracle.
Of the works of Dædalus there are two among theBœotians ; a statue of Hercules belonging to the Thebans,and of Trophonius belonging to the Lebadenscs. Thereare the fame number of wooden statues in Crete, viz.Britomartis in Olus, and Minerva among the Gnoflians.Befideu these, too, they have a representation of the danceof Ariadne, which is mentioned by Homer in the Iliad;and this is made of white stone. Among the Delianslikewise there is a wooden statue of Venus not largo, theright hand of which is decayed through length of rime rand this statue stands on a square figure instead of feet.-

is possible to his nature, into a plantal condition of being, into abeautiful but transient flower; that is, into a corporeal life,or a life totally consisting in the mere energies of nature.So that Narcissus is tlie image of a foul converting herself tophantasy, and through this becoming drawn under the dominionof fense.
But it is here necessary to observe, that the death of Narcissusis related by Plotinus and the anonymous author De Incredibi-libus in Gale's Qpufcula in a manner different from that of Ovid.For according to them Narcissus merged himself into the stream,through endeavouring to embrace his shadow, and disappeared.The fable however is extremely beautiful, whether we considerNarcissus as changed into a flower or suffocated in the stream:"For (says Plotinus, Ennead. I. lib. vi.) as he in the fable, whoby catching at his' shadow merged himself in the stream anddisappeared, so he who is captivated by beautiful bodies, anddoes not depart from their embrace, is precipitated not with hisbody but with his foul into a darkness profound and horrid tointellect, through which becoming blind both here and in Hades,he converses with nothing but shadows."

Hence Tiresias is said by Homer, Odyss. 10.ver. 493, &c. to be the only wise person in Hades, and to pos­sess intellect though dead, through Proserpine, while the otherinhabitants of Hades arc nothing more than flying shadows.For it may be truly asserted of such a one, both in the presentlife and hereafter, that he alone is wise and endued with intellect,

340 NOTES ON THE


"According to ancient theologifts, Jupiter is referred to Saturn,Saturn to Heaven, and Heaven to the most ancient Ophlon, ofwhom there is no original." The Scholiast on the Prometheusof Æschylus fays nearly the fame. This most ancient godOphion is therefore, as it appears to me, the fame with the Or­phic dragon, the original of all things: for Ophion is doubtlessderived from ofi,- ophit, a serpent. But of this dragon, Damas-cius, in his treatise mci a.pxu'i On Principles, gives the followingaccount: "I likewise find in the Orphic rhapsodies, that thetheology neglecting the two first principles (viz. æther andchaos) together with the one principle who is delivered insilence (i. e. the first cause) establishes the third principle pos­terior to the two as the original; because this first of all possessessomething essable and commensurate to human discourse. Forin the former hypothesis, the highly reverenced and undecayingTime, the father of æther and chaos, was the principle; but inthis Tims is neglected, and the principle becomes a dragon/'See more from Damascius, on the most interesting of all sub­jects, In my Introduction to the Paimenides of Plato. I onlyadd, that the Ophion with whom Eurynome is co-ordinate inthe fame manner as Rhea is with Saturn, must be considered asa procession from the Ophion who is the fame with the Orphicdragon.

so* THE DESCRIPTION


plantation of trees, and the sowing of seeds of every kind;,and abounds with excellent pastures. Hence they payparticular attention to the cultivation of this part of thecountry. And hence there are some who think that Ho­mer in the following verse, by the Parapotamii, or inha­bitants of the river, does not allude to a city, but to thosewho cultivate the land near the Cephissus:
"And those who near divine Cephissus dwell.'*
This opinion, however, may be confuted, both by thehistory of Herodotus, and the particulars which are re­lated of the Pythian victories. For the Amphictyons firstinstituted the Pythian games, and the Parapotamian Æch-mseas was the first that in these games conquered boysin boxing. In like manner Herodotus, when he enume­rates the cities of the Phocenscs which Xerxes burnt,reckons among them the Parapotamians. These people,however, were not restored by the Athenians and Bœo­tians, but were obliged through imbecility, and want ofmoney, to betake themselves to other cities. The ruins,indeed, of this city do not at present remain, nor is iteven known where it formerly stood.
From Lilæa there is a road of about sixty stadia inlength, which leads to Amphiclea. The inhabitants ofthis place have corrupted the name of the city: for He­rodotus, following the most ancient reports, calls it Ophi­tea: and the Amphictyons, when a decree was passedfpr destroying the cities of the Phocenses, gave it the namepf Ophitea. But the natives relate the following particu­lars concerning this city: A certain powerful man, sus­pecting the stratagems of his enemies, placed his son in avessel sijch as is used for the reception of liquor^ trusting

w hole period receiving , a triple division, into a life under thedominion of Jupiter, which is prior to generation, into a lifeunder the dominion of Neptune, and which is in generation,Pluto, who is characterized according to intellect, with greatpropriety converts ends to beginnings, forming a circle withouta beginning or an end, not only in fouls, but in bodies. Thusfor instance, he eternally evolves the circulations of the stars, themotions of things in generation, and the like. But some erro­neously analyse the name of Pluto into wealth from the earth,through fruits and metals; and of Aides*, into the obscure, dark,and terrible. These are now censured by Socrates, who assignsthe fame meaning to these two names; referring Pluto, as intel­lect, to the tvealth of prudence, and Aides to an intellect whichknows all things. For this god is a sophists, who purifies foulsafter death, and frees them from generation. For Aides, or, thtobscure, is not, as some erroneoufly interpret it, evil; since neitheris death an evil, though Aides appears to some to be full of per­turbation. But every thing intelligible is obscure; and in thisfense Aides is better than every visible nature. The lovers ofbody however, who viciously refer the passions of the animatedpart to themselves, consider death as something terrible; and asthe cause of corruption: but in reality it i9 much better for a manto die, and live in Hades according to nature, than to live withbody contrary to nature, and prevented from energizing intel­lectually. Hence, it is necessary to strip ourselves of the flesti Jwith which we are invested, as Ulysses did of his torn garments,and not, together with the indigence of body, clothe ourselveswith that which resembles the vestment of a mendicant. "For(as the Oracle fays) things divine cannot be obtained by those whoseintellectual eye is direScd to body j but those only can arrive at the
* One of Pluto's names.
f The reader must be careful to consider the word Sophist in this placein its primary sense, viz. one wise and learned.X i. e. We must purify ourselves from a tendency to body.

pile is raised for the sacrifice. They reckoifcit necessarytoo to roll round the victims linen or flaxen bandages.And this is the Egyptian mode of adorning the victims.But they cause all the victims which are immolated to passin the procession; and it is the employment of some tosend them into the adytum, and of others who are beforethe adytum to burn the tents; after which they speedilydepart from this place.
They fay too, that a certain person once among thenumber of those who are forbidden to enter the adytum,and who indeed was a profane man, when the pile wasenkindled, through curiosity and boldness entered the ady­tum; that all parts of it appeared to him to be full ofspectres; and that on his returning to Tithonca, as soonas he had related all that he had seen, he died. I haveheard things similar to these of a certain Phœnician.They say that the Egyptians celebrate the festival of Isisin that part of the year in which she bewails Osiris;that then the Nile begins to ascend; and that the vulgarof the natives fay, that the tears of Isis cause the Nile toincrease and irrigate the fields. At that time, therefore,a certain Roman, who was the prefect of Egypt, per­suaded a man, for a sum os money, to enter into theadytum of Isis in Coptos. This man returned indeed,but died as soon as he had told what he had seen.Homer, therefore, appears to speak truly when he says,that no man can clearly behold the gods, and at the fametime be prosperous in his affairs. But Tithoræa producesfewer olives than either the Attic or Sicyonian land. Itsolives, however, are superior both in colour and sweet­ness to those which are brought from Spain and I stria.They form all various kinds of ointments from these, andsend these olives as a present to Cæsar.

Lad of all follow theLacedæmonians, Epicyridas and Eteonicus. They faythat these were made by Patrocles and Canachus. Butthe Athenians affirm, that the loss which they suffered atÆgospotamos happened to them unjustly, in consequenceof the commanders of their army being bribed. For theyfay that Tydeus and Adimantus received presents fromLyfander: and in proof of this they adduce the followingSibylline oracle: " And then shall high-thundering Ju­piter, who possesses the greatest strength, severely afflictthe Athenians: for he will bring war and destruction ontheir ships, which will perish through the fraudulent con­duct of their commanders.'' They likewise produce the fol­lowing testimony from the oracles of Musæus: " A mightystorm shall burst on the Athenians, through the basenessof their leaders; but they will be consoled for (heir mis­fortune, by subverting the city of their enemies, andavenging the loss which they sustained." And thus muchconcerning tlii- affair. But the lame Sibyl predicted, thatthe event of the engagement which tock place betweenthe Lacedæmonians anj Argives above Thyrea, would be
doubtful.

through the wounds and weakness of their bodies wereunable to follow them.
The Gauls too were obliged to fix their camps in thatplace where the night came upon them during theirflight: and in the night,they were seized with a panicterror. For dread which is produced from no apparentcause, is-said to be sent by Pan. This terror seized thearmy of the Barbarians about midnight: and at first, afew of them were agitated with such irrational sear, thatthey seemed to themselves to hear the found of horsesadvancing towards them, arid to perceive the approach ofthe enemy. Not long after the whole army was infectedwith the fame stupid sear. In consequence of this theyhastily took up their arms; and a disagreement arisingamong them, they mutually flew each other, through thedarkness of the night, and their insane terror, neither un­derstanding their native language, nor recognizing thecountenances of each other, nor the figure of their shields ibut each party fancied that the troops which it opposedwere Greeks, and that the arms which they saw, and thevoices which they heard, were Grecian. And this insanity,which was sent by divinity, caused a great multitude ofthe Gauls to flaughter each other. This rnaflacre toowas first of all perceived by those Phocenses who wereleft in the fields to guard the cattle ; and the Greeks wereinformed by these of what had happened to the BarbariansJn the night. The courage of the Phocenses, therefore,being roused by this intelligence, they rushed with greateralacrity on the Gauls, placed a stronger guard over theircattle, and were careful that no provision sliould be takenfrom their ficid6 without an engagement ensuing.

But in the following year, inwhich Democles was the Athenian archon, the Gaulsagain passed over into Asia. And such is the genuine ac­count of the particulars of this war.


CHAP. XXIV.
In the vestibule of the Delphic tempi;, precepts usefulto the conduct of human life are written. These werecomposed by men who arc called wise by the Greeks, viz»from Ionia, by Thales the Milesian, and Bias Prienensis:from the Æolians in Lesbos, Pittacus the Mitylenaran:from the Dorians in Asia, Cleobulus the Lindian : besidesthese, Solon the Athenian, and Chilon the Spartan: andfor the seventli, Myson the Chenean enumerates Plato theson of Ariston, instead of Periander the son of Cypselus.Formerly the village Chcnæ in the mountain Oeta was in­habited. These wise men therefore coming to Dclpbos, de­dicated to Apollo those celebrated sentences, Know tfastlfyand Nothing immoderately: and these sentences they wrotein the vestibule of the temple. You may fee too here abrazen statue of Homer on a pillar ; and on it the followingoracle of Apollo respecting Homer is inscribed: " Blessedand unfortunate •, for thou art born to each of these.

And theMuses give subsidence to the harmony of foul j but Apollois the leader of intellectual and indivisible harmony. TheMuses distribute the phænomena according to harmonical rea­sons: but Apollo comprehends unapparent and separate har­mony. And though both give subsistence to the same things,yet the Muses effect this according to number, but Apollo ac­cording to union. And the Muses indeed distribute the unity ofApollo: but Apollo unites and contains harmonic multitude.:for the multitude of the Muses proceeds from the essence ofMusagetes, which is both separate, and subsists according to the

were in a very desponding condition through the mag«nitude of the fine, Philomelas the son of Theotimus,who was not inferior in nobility to any of the Pho­cenfes, and whoic country was Ledon a Phocic city,shewed them that it was impossible for them to pay thefine, and persuaded them to plunder the temple ofthe Delphic Apollo. Amon£ other arguments whichhe offered in order to effect this, he informed them,that the affairs of the Athenians, and Lacedxmonianswere in a condition very well adapted to the executionof this design and that if the Thebans or any other na­tion should make war upon them, they might easily van­quish their enemies, both by their own valour, and themoney which they would be enabled to expend. Thisspeech of Philomelus was favourably received by the mul­titude of the Phocenfes, whether some god perverted theirunderstandings or whether these people naturally preferredgain to piety. The Phocenfes therefore plundered thetemple of Apollo, when Heraclides governed the Delphi,and Agathocles was the Athenian aichonj and in thefourth year of the one hundred and fifth Olympiad, inwhich the Cyrenæan Prorus was victorious. After thisthey collected together a very powerful army of merce­nary soldiers; and the Thebans openly declared war againstthem, in consequence of being at variance with themprior to this event.
-This war lasted for ten years; and during the conti­nuance of it, the Phocenfes with their mercenary troopswere sometimes victorious, and this was often the cafewith the Thebans. But an engagement taking place nearshe city Neon, the Phocenfes were put to flight, and inthis flight Philwnelus hurled himsejf from a precipice,

absurdity in which such fables are involved. The first of theseu from considering the orderly ettfiinSion in the progression of allthe divine genera from their ineffable source. I mean that someare the causes of union, and others ofseparation to things posterior;that some Impart a generating power, and others an undejihdpurity-to subordinate natures; and that some impart a good, separatefrom the nature of its recipient, but others such a 'good as isconsubsistent with its receptacle. Now this distinction, andseeming opposition, in divine natures, was called by ancient my-thologists contention and war. I fay seeming opposition: forall divine natures subsist in the most perfect friendship and pro­found union with each other; and at the same time that the es­sence and energy of each are perfectly distinct, they are either allin all, which is the case with the divine unities, or all in each,which is the cafe with forms or ideas.
But the second mode of considering the battles of the gods,is by regarding their progressions into the universe; in conse­quence of which the last orders dependent on the gods, as theyare produced by a long interval from the first causes, are con­tiguous to the subjects of their government, and adhere to mat­ter, contract contrariety and all-various division, and, by theirproximate care of mortal concerns, are obnoxious to desires andpassions. Lastly, on account of their great sympathy with mor­tal concerns, and the partial providence which they exert fortheir welfare, they actually war with each other. But as eventhe last orders which perpetually follow the gods, preserve theproperties of their leaders, though in a partial and manifold man­ner, hence they were very properly called, by the ancients, bythe names of the gods their respective leaders. Thus for in­stance, not only the deity who illuminates all things with super­mundane light, and who sits with Jupiter and the celestial gods,was called Apollo, but this name was given to the dæmon whowas the guardian of Hector. This last mode indeed of consider­ing battles among the gods, is the key, in the hands of the skil­ful,

if they could induce the Barbarians to leave their countrybefore it was ruined- Hence, Pindar appears to me tohave spoken truly, when he says, that every one feels theweight of his own calamities, but is not affected with thesufferings of others. At that time, therefore, the promiseof the Ænianae and Heracleotæ roused the courage ofBrennus, who leaving Acichorius in his camps, and in­forming him that it would be proper for him to attackthe enemy, when he was certain that he was assaultingthem behind with a chosen band of forty thousand men,marched through the mountain Oeta. It happened, how­ever, on that day, that the mountain was covered withsuch a thick mist, that the sun was darkened, so that thePhocenses, who guarded that passage of the mountain, didnot perceive the Barbarians till they were quite nearthem. Hence, some began to engage the Gauls, andothers strenuously sustained their attacks; but being atlength vanquished, they were compelled to abandon theirpost. With great celerity, therefore, before Greece wasentirely surrounded by the G auls, they returned to theirallies, and informed them of the impending danger. TheAthenians, immediately on this information, received intotheir galleys the Grecian forces at Thermopylæ, who af­terwards returned to their respective, countries.

Jt: and when Philammon with a chosen band of ArglveJcame to assist the Delphi, both he and his forces fell inthe engagement which ensued. That the Phlegyans, in­deed, delighted in warlike affairs beyond the rest of theGreeks, is evident from these line's of Homer in the Iliad,respecting Mars and the son of Mars, Terror:
"From Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarmsOf Warring Phlegyaris, and Ephyrian arms.'1
But, in these verses, he appears to me to call those that in­habit the Thesprotian Epirus, Ephyri. However, divinitynearly destroyed the race of the Phlegyans by continuedthunder and violent earthquakes, and those that werelest were destroyed by pestilence, except a few that fledto Phocis.
But Phlegyas dying without children, Chryses the sonof Neptune, by Chrysogenea the daughter of Halmus,feigned after him. The son of this Chryses was Minyas;and from him, the people that he governed are even atpresent called Minyæ. So great was the tribute whichwas paid to this Minyas, that he surpassed in wealth allthose that reigned before him, and was the first we areacquainted with among the Minyæ that built a treasuryfor the purpose of securing his riches. And there arecertain Greeks, who have great knowledge in affairs ofthis kind, by whom these treasuries are considered as morewonderful than those which their own country contains.However, the most illustrious historians, who have giventhe most accurate account of the Egyptian pyramids, havenot made the least mention of the treasury of Minyas,and the walls of Tiryns, though they are equally worthyof admiration. The son of this Minyas was Orchomenus:and during his reign the city was called Orchomenes, and

Th^e Orchomenians were led bythese two against; Troy; partook of the expedition of thesons of Codrus to Ionia; and being driven from theircountry by the Thebans, recovered it again by the assistanceof Philip the son of Amyntas. A divine power, how­ever, always caused their affairs to verge to an imbecilcondition.


CHAP. XXXVIII.
Among the Orchomenians there is a temple of Bac­chus, and a most, ancient temple of the Graces. Theyvenerate in a most eminent degree certain stones, whichthey fay fell from heaven, and were taken up by Eteocles.But the adorned statues, or those which are artificiallymade, and which are of stone, were dedicated in my time.The Orchomenians top have a fountain, which deservesto be inspected ; and into which they descend for the pur­pose of drawing water. But the treasury of Minyas is notinferior to any of the wonderful productions of Grecianart. It is built of stone, is of a round figure, and its topdoes not raise itself to a very flmrp point. They say thatthe topmost stone holds together the whole building.There are likewise sepulchres here of Minyas and Hesiod:and they fay that they came to possess the bones of Hefiod,by the following means: A pestilence once raging in theircountry to the destruction of men and caUle, they sent4 certain

the son of Lampus was proclaimed victor on the harp;Areas Echembrotus in singing to the pipe; and the ArgivcSacadas in playing on the pipe without singing.
The fame Sacadas too was twice victorious after this,in the Pythian games. And at that time the fame con­test* were instituted as in the Olympic games, except thecontest with four horses. It was likewise established bylaw, that boys should contend in the long race, and in thetwofold course. After this, Pythian games were insti­tuted, in which a crown alone was the object of conten­tion, and in which singing to the pipe was rejected, asnot being pleasing to the car. For elegies and funernldirges are accommodated to the melody of pipes. The,sacred offering of Echembrotus confirms what 1 have said:for he dedicated in Thebes a brazen tripod to Hercules,with this inscription: Echembrotus Arcas dedicatesthis statue to Hercules, in consequence of having
BEEN VICTORIOUS rN THE CONTESTS OF THE AmPHIC-TYONS, AND THIS BY SINGING AMONG THE GREEKS,
songs and elegies. This was the reason, therefore,why the contest of singing to the pipe ceased. After­wards they added horse-races, and Clisthenes the Sicyo-nian tyrant was victorious in the chariot-race. In theeighth Pythiad, the contests of those who play on the harp,but do not accompany it with their voice, were instituted;and in this contest Agelaus Tegeates was victorious. Inthe twenty-third Pythiad, the armed course was esta­blished; and in this Timænctus tiie Phliasian received thelaurel crown, in five Olympiads after which DemaratusHencensis was victorious. In the forty-eighth Pythirul,the contest with the two-yoked car was adopted; and iuthis the car of Execestides the Phocenlian was victorious,j But

Above those which I have now numerated, this picturecontains a representation of the companions of Ulysses,Perimedes and Eurylochus, carrying victims; and theseare black rams. After these there is a man seated; andthe inscription shews that he is Ocnus. He is representedtwisting a rope : and a female ass stands by him, who eatsthe rope as fast he twists it. They fay that this Ocnuswas an industrious man, who had an expensive wife; andthat whatever he collected by his industry, she soon afterfound means to consume. They are of opinion, therefore,that Polygnotus designed to represent this affair by therope-maker and his ass. I know, indeed, that the lonians,when they fee a man very industrious, but at the fametime labouring without any emolument, fay that he twiststhe rope of Ocnus. Diviners, too, who prophesy fromthe flight os birds, call a certain bird Ocnus: and thisbird is the largest and most beautiful of herons, and at thefame time is very rare. Tityus too is painted in this picture;and is represented as no longer punished, but perfectlywearied out with uninterrupted punishment. There islikewise a certain obscure and imperfect image. On turn­ing your attention to the other parts of the picture, youwill fee Ariadne very near the man who twists the rope.She sits on a rock, and looks at her sister Phædra: andher body is suspended by a rope which she holds withboth her hands. Indeed the particulars respecting th«death of Phædra are here signified in a more becomingmanner. But Bacchus took away Ariadne from Theseus,

pumice stone; and that we reside at the bottom of certain ofthese hollows, while we fancy that we dwell on the summit ofthe earth. The great antiquity of this doctrine may be collectedfrom what Homer fays in the Iliad, that Heaven and Earth arecommon to the three divinities, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto*:and consequently each of these mull be divided between them.The earth, therefore,must be divided analogous to the universe;into that which is celestial, terrestrial, and middle. And theremust be some part of it ethereal, which belongs to Jupiter. Asthis part therefore cannot be the surface on which we reside, itmust consequently be contiguous to the moon. See more con­cerning this curious and interesting theory, in my Introductionsto the Phædo and Timæus of Plato.
Page 93. Ceres Anefidora.~\ This word means the bejlower ofgifts, and is agreeable to the etymon of Ceres given by Plato inthe Cratylus: for Jiytiilup, fays he, is Ji?<»<r<* luStf, a he/lowingmother. But why this goddess was so called by the wife ancients,the following beautiful extract from the MSS. Scholia of Procluson the Cratylus will abundantly unfold: "It is requisite toconsider this goddess, not only as the supplier of corporeal food,but, beginning from the gods, we should view her as first of allsupplying them with aliment, afterwards the natures posteriorto the gods, and last of all such as are indigent of corporealaliment. For the characteristic of love shines forth first ofall in the gods: and this is the cafe with the medicinal andprophetic powers of Apollo, and with those of every otherdivinity. But nutriment, when considered with reference to thegods, is the communication of intellectual plenitude from moreexalted natures to those of au inferior rank. Gods thereforeare nourished, when they view with the eye of intellect godsprior to themselves; when they are persecteJ, and view intelli­gible beauties, such as justice itself, temperance itself, and the

This being premised, as a specimen of the manner in whichfables are to be understood, let us consider the meaning of thatto which Pausaniasalludes. According to the fable, then, Vulcanfalling in love with Minerva, emitted his feed on the earth, andfrom hence sprang the race of the Athenians. ■ By Vulcan,therefore, we must understand that divine power which presidesover the spermatic and physical reasons which the universe con­tains: for whatever Nature accomplishes by verging towardsbodies, the fame Vulcan performs in a divine and exempt manner,by moving Nature, and using her as an instrument in his ownproper fabrication : for natural heat has a Vulcanian characteristic,and was produced by Vulcan for the purpose of fabricating a cor­poreal nature. Vulcan, therefore, is that power which perpe­tually presides over the fluctuating nature of bodies: and hence,fays Olympiodorus, he operates with bellows (iifvrai;), whichoccultly signifies his operating in natures (avli nv ntatf fiwicn).But by earth we must understand matter, which was thus symboli­cally denominated by the ancients, as we learn from Porphyry deAntr. Nymph. By Minerva we must understand the summit xopvpnof all those intellectual natures that reside in Jupiter, the artificerof the world: or, in other words, (he is that deity which illuminatesall mundane natures with intelligence. The Athenians therefore,who are fouls of a Minerval characteristic, may be very properlysaid to be the progeny of Vulcan and the Earth, because Vulcan,who perpetually imitates the intellectual energy of Minerva in hisfabrication of the sensible universe, imparts to them through thisimitation those -vehicles, and those spermatic reasons through which,in conjunction with matter, they become inhabitants of this ter­restrial abode. And thus much for the fable alluded to by Pau­sanias. For farther information on the most interesting subjectsdiscussed in this note, fee my tranflation of the Cratylus, Phædo,Parmenides and Timæus of Plato; my Dissertation on the Eleu-siuian and Bacchic Myiteiies; my Translation of Sallust on the

And of these, Jupiter possesses such as are celes­tial, Pluto such as are terrestrial, and Neptune the natures be­tween these. Hence Jupiter holds a sceptre, which signifieshis judicial power*. But Neptune a trident, because he it thtinspective guardian os this triple nature, which has a middlejituation.And Pluto wears a helmet, on account of the darkness overwhich he presides.

And here, a reader unskilled in the ancient theology willdoubtless object, that according to this doctrine, Neptune musteither be the fame with Juno, since he is the divinity of air, orthere must be two divinities of the air. To this I answer, thatNeptune, considered as one divinity who presides over all themiddle elements, comprehends in his essence Juno, according toher sublunary distribution; so that both Neptune and Junogovern the air, but the former more universally, and the lattermore particularly; the former ruling at the same time over other

However, for myown part, I prefer Ptolemy's authority to that of Mr. Bruce,notwithstanding the person of Mr. Bruce during his travelswas, as he informs us, by no means despicable; and in additionto this, his circumstances, were affluent, and his connectionspowerful!

souls, such as heroes, beneficent dæmons and angels, and of thegods themselves. But the allotments of angels, dæmons andheroes are suspended from those of the gods, and possess a morevarious distribution: for one divine allotment comprehends manyangelic allotments, and a still greater number of such as are dse-moniacaL For multitude is every where suspended from one prin­ciple. Arid as in essences, powers and energies, progression*from these generate a kindred multitude; so with respect toallotments, such as are first transcend in power, but are dimi­nished according to multitude, as being nearer the one father ofthe universe, and the one total providence which he contains;but such as are second to these possess a subordinate power, andan increased multitude.
Such then being the general particulars respecting the theoryof allotments, the next thing to be considered is, that the allot­ment of a divine nature, whether celestial or sublunary, is anunrestrained government, and a providential energy about thesubjects of its government. By unrestrained government I meiaan exemption from all passivity, and from any tendency towardsor alliance with subordinate natures: for every thing divine itat the fame time every where aud no where. It is every where,considered as illuminating all things with its own ineffable light *and it is no where, considered as exempt from all the propertiesof the natures which it illumines. The fame too must be un­derstood, in an inferior degree, of those beneficent natures that arethe perpetual attendants of the gods: for the energy of these alsois unrestrained, but not in that transcendant manner in which itis possessed by the gods. In the third place, the allotments of thegods and their attendants are perpetual: for immutabilityis the essential property of a divine nature, and consequent*ly must be communicated to that which perpetually attendsdivinity, and exerts a beneficent energy.

But the multitude of the Gauls that died in Phocis inbattle was not much less than six thousand: those thatwere destroyed by cold in the night, and afterwards bypanic terror, were more than ten thousand; and a likenumber perished by famine. And this information re­specting the Gauls, was obtained by means of men whowere sent by the Athenians to consult the Delphic oracle.The Bœotians likewise joined themselves to those Athe­nians, who having moved their camps, marched throughBccotia: and both these following the Barbarians, perpe­tually cut off by stratagem those that were in the rear oftheir army, The'sorces of Acichorius were not able tojpin those that fled with Brennus till the night precedingtheir flight. For the Ætolians, by continually infestingthem with their darts, and every kind of missive weaponthat came to hand, rendered their march flow ; and hence,no great multitude of them escaped to the camp nearHeraclea.

Zosteria. For Amphitryon is said to have armed himselfin this place, when he was on the point of engaging withthe Eubœenses and Chalcodon. But to put on armour,was called by the ancients begirding. For when Homermakes the zone of Agamemnon similar to that of Mars,they fay, that he means by this word the apparatus ofhis armour.
There is a common sepulchre here of Zethus and Am-phion, which is not large, and is nothing more than aiieap of earth. The inhabitants of Tithorea among the•Fhocenses are desirous of carrying away earth from thistomb, and this wlien the fun is in Taurus. For then, ifihtey add the earth taken away from this tomb to thesepulchre of Antiope, their own land becomes more pro­lific, but the contrary happens to that of the Thebans.And on this account the Thebans at that time carefullyguard the sepulchre. But these cities are persuaded thatthis vi Uj be the cafe from the oracles of Bacis; for thefollowfig lines are found among these oracles: "Whenthe Tuhorenses shall offer libations, prayers, and atone-p'Tments to Amphion and Zethus, a bull being heated bythe-illustrious power of the fun, then beware of a maladyof no trifling nature, which shall infest the city. For thefruits in the land shall perish, if you suffer any of yourearth to be taken away, and placed on the sepulchre ofJ?hocus." But Bacis calls it the monument of Phocus,because Dirce die wife of Lycus honoured Bacchus aboveall the divinities; and when she suffered that dire punish­ment from Amphion and Zethus, Bacchus was indignantvith Antiope; and, as the punishments of the gods arealways transcendent, afflicted her with madness, and bythis means caused her to wander over all Greece.

22S NOTES ON THE


It is remarkable that, according to the first of these passages,the second Venus was produced from foam in the fame manneras the first, as Proclus proves from the authority of the Orphicwritings: for this information is not to be gathered from anyother writer that 1 am acquainted with. Nor need it seemstrange, that this should be mentioned by no ancient authorprior to Proclus: for before the establishment of the Christianreligion, the Orphic writings were deservedly held in such greatveneration, from containing the ceremonies of a mode of wor­ship coeval with the universe, that the less mystic parts of themwere but seldom cited, and the most mystic, not at all. As Pro­clus, therefore, was the man that unfolded the theology and phi­losophy of the Greeks in the most consummate perfection, andthis at a period when the ancient religion was almost entirelyextirpated, and the Orphic writings were considered as sacred butby a few, we cannot wonder at meeting with this, and muchsimilar information in the works of this incomparable man.
Page 46. They assert that he <was once bound by Pluto, &c."]It appears to me, that the great confusion and absurdity withwhich modern explanations of the fables of the ancients are re­plete, may be ascribed to the two following causes: the wantof ability to distinguish in the same person, history from fable;and ignorance of the secret meaning of ancient fable. Thus, inthe present instance, most of the moderns would, I am persuaded,consider this story about Theseus, as at bottom merely historical,though it is in fact one of those ancient fables which are repletewith the most philosophical and mystic information. At present,indeed, it does not seem to be even suspected by any one, thatthe theology of the Greeks, when viewed in its genuine purity,is a thing the most sublime and scientific that the mind of maacan possibly devise; and that consequently, as the Grecian fablesare the progeny of this theology, they cannot fail of being re­markably scientific and sublime.

Such of these, therefore, as have the circle oflameness unfettered, as are roused to an elevated life, and aremoved about it, according to a deific energy—these are saidto have a god for their father, and a mortal for their mother,through a defect with respect to the opinionative form of life.But such, on the contrary, as energize without impediment ac­cording to the circle of difference, who act with becoming-rectitude in practical affairs, and at the fame time cntlntsia/licallytor, in other words, under the inspiring influence of divinity—these are said to have a mortal for their father, and a goddess fortheir mother. And in stiort, rectitude of energy in each of thesecircles is to be ascribed to a divine cause, which illuminates,invigorates and excites them in the mod unrestrained and im-paiTive manner, without destroying freedom of energy, in thecircles themselves, or causing any partial affection, sympathy ortendency in illuminating deity. When the circle of sameness,therefore, has dominion, the divine cause of illumination is (aidto be masculine and paternal; but when the circle of differencepredominates, it is said to be maternal. Hence Achilles act8with rectitude in practical affairs, and at the fame time exhibitsspecimens of magnificent, vehement, and divinely-inspired ener­gy, as being the son of a goddess. And inch is his attachmentto practical virtue, that even when in Hades, Homer representshim as desiring a union with body, that he may aflist his father.While on the contrary Minos and Rhadamanthus, who wereheroes illuminated by Jupiter, raised themselves from generationto true being, and meddled with mortal conctrns no farther dunabsolute necessity required.

In this part of the picture too is Sche»dius, who led the Phocenfes to Troy: and after him isPelias sitting on a throne, and whose beard is equallyhoary with his head. He is represented looking at Or-phcus. But Schedius holds a dagger in his hand, and iscrowned with grafs. Thamyris, whose sight is destroyed,fits near Pelias. His whole figure is that of a humble ab­ject man i his hair- too and beard are thick and long. Nearhis feet there is a lyre, which appears to have beenthrown down, the bent parts of which are broken, andthe chords are burst. Above him is Marsyas silting ona stone j and near Marsyas, Olympus stands, who is aboy in the flower of his youth, and has the figure of. onelearning to play on. the pipe. The Phrygians who inhabitCeiænæ are of opinion, that the river which runs throughtheir country was once this Marsyas.

Afterthis, very skilful horsemen drive the busts into this in­closure, who falling through the slipperiness of the hidesare hurled headlong to the bottom of the plain. Here theyleave them for four or five days, till they are debilitated byweariness and hunger, and are considerably tamed.

It appears to me, that the perpetuity of these lamps was ow­ing to the consummate tenacity of the unctuous matter withwhich the flame was united, being so proportioned to the strengthof the fire, that, like the radical moisture and natural heat inanimals, neither of them could conquer or destroy the other.Licetus, who is of this opinion, observes, that in order to pre­serve this equality of proportion, the ancients hid these lamps incaverns, or close monuments: and hence it has happened, thaton opening these tombs, the admission of fresh air to the lampshas produced so great an inequality between the flame and theoil, that they have been presently extinguished.

quence of their being deceived in this manner, Alcmenewas in reality delivered.
There is a temple here of Hercules with a stone statue,which they call Promachos, or the defender: and this wasmade by the Thebans, Xenocratus and Eubius. But theThebans are of opinion, that the ancient wooden statuein this place was made by Dædalus ; and it appears to me,that this was really the cafe. They fay that Dædalus de­dicated this statue on account of the benevolent inter­position of divinity in his favour. For when he had con­structed for himself and his son Icarus a small ship, andhad discovered the use of sails, which were unknown be­fore, so that he was able, in consequence of being drivenby a prosperous wind, to outstrip the vessel of Minos, hehimself escaped in safety; but they say that Icarus, beingunskilled in the art of piloting the fliip, overturned it,and was by this means swallowed up by the waves, anddriven to an island of Pergamus, the name of which isat present unknown. They add, that Hercules metwith the dead body, and, knowing it, buried it, whereeven now there is a heap of earth not very large, in thepromontory which extends to the Ægean sea. But theisland and the sea about it were denominated from Icarus,In the roof of this temple Praxiteles carved for the The-rbans many of the twelve labours of Hercules.

brought Solon from Athens, that he might assist them byhis councils. On their consulting the oracle too respect­ing the victory, the Pythian deity thus answered them:** You will not be able to subvert the tower os this city,till the waves of azure-eyed Amphitrite, sounding on theblack deep, shall warn my grove." Solon therefore per­suaded them to consecrate the Cirrhæan land to Apollo,so that the grove of the god might be near the sea. Helikewise employed another stratagem against the Cirrhæ-ans; for he turned the course of the river Plistus, whichflowed into the city. When the inhabitants too of thecity resisted their besiegers, drinking from wells, and col­lecting rain water, Solon threw some roots of helleboreinto the Plistus; and, when he perceived that the waterwas sufficiently infected with the poison, turned the riveragain into its ancient channel. The Cinrhaeans therefore,drinking greedily of the water, were afflicted with a vio­lent flux, and were no longer able to guard die walls. Inconsequence of this the Amphictyons took the city, andpunished the Cirrhæans for their impiety to the god.Then too Cirrha became the haven of the Delphi. Thiscity likewise contains a temple of Apollo, Diana, and La-tona; and in it there are large statues of Attic workman­ship.

the most diligent and accurate inquiry, it is slot agreeableto me to give my opinion on this subject, as I know thatIt has occasioned great disputes among men of formertimes, and that there is no small contention about - kamong poets of the present day. There is a statue heretoo of the Thracian Orpheus, withJV/rff, or mystic sacrificetstanding by his side. He is represented singing, and issurrounded by wild beasts fashioned from brass and stone,who are listening to his song. The Greeks, indeed, be­lieve many things which are by no means true, and thisamong the rest, that Orpheus was the son of the MuseCalliope, and not of that Calliope who was the daughterof Pierus; that he allured wild beasts by the melody ofhis lyre; and that he descended to Hades while alive, forthe purpose of requesting the infernal gods to restore himback his wife. But it appears to me, that Orpheus sur­passed all the poets that were prior to him in the eleganceof his compositions, and that he acquired great authorityin consequence of the general opinion, that he inventedthe mysteries of the gods, purifications for impious actions,remedies for diseases, and the methods of appeasing thewrath of divinity.
They report too concerning him, that the Thracianwomen endeavoured to take away his life by stratagem,because he persuaded their husbands to attend him in hiswanderings, but that they had not the boldness to putthis design in execution through fear of their hustvinds jat length, however, by drinking largely of wine, th;y ac­complished this daring project.

AbOVE those women which are between Æthra andNestor, other captives are painted, viz. Clymene, Creusa,Aristomache, and Xenodice. Stesichorus, in his . poemon the destruction of Troy, ranks Clymene among thecaptives. In 'a similar manner the poet Ennus fays, thatAristomache was the daughter of Priam, and that she wasmarried to Critolaus the son of Icetaon. But I do notknow of any poet, or prose writer, that makes men­tion of Xenodice. It is said of Creusa, that she wastaken from the Greeks, and restored to liberty by theMother of the Gods and Venus, and that flie was the wifeof Æneas. Lescheus, however, and the author of theCyprian verses, fay that Eurydice was the wife of Æneas.Above these Deinomoe, Metioche, Pifis, and Cleodiceare painted reclining on a bed. The name of one of theseonly is mentioned in the poem called the Small Iliad:and it appears to me, that Polygnotus invented the othernames. Here too Epeus is painted, throwing down thewalls of Troy from their foundations. And the onlything above these is the head of the horse Durateus. Poly-poetes likewise the son of Pirithous is painted, having hishead bound with a fillet. Acamas the son of Theseusstands by him with a helmet on his head, and a CTeston the helmet.

discourse is referred to tliis god. He presides therefore over everyspecies of erudition, leading us to an intelligible essence from thismortal abode, governing the d'sserent herds of fouls, and dis­persing the sleep ;'.nd oblivion with which they are oppiessed. Heis likewise the supplier of recollection, the end of which is a ge­nuine intellectual apprehension of divine natures."
After tliis he observes that the different r.ges of our life on theearth correspond to the order of the universe: "For our firstage (says he) partakes in an eminent degree of the lunar ope­rations; as we then live according to a nutritive and natural. power. But our second age participates of Mercurial preroga­tives; because we then apply ourselves to letters, music and wrest­ling. The third age is governed by Venus; because then we be­gin to produce seed, and the geneiative powers of nature arc putin motion. The fourth age is solar; for then oar youth is in itsvigour and full perfection, subsisting as a medium between gene­ration and decay; for such is the order which vigour is allotted.But the sifth age is governed by Mars; in which we principallyaspiie after power and superiority over others. The sixth age isgoverned by Jupiter; for in this we give ourselves up to pru­dence, and pursue an active and political life. And the seventhage is Saturnian, in which it is natural to separate ourselves fromgeneration, and transfer ourselves to an iueorporeal life. Andthus much we h :ve discussed, in order to procure belief that let­ters, and the wkjble education of youth, is suspended from theMercu: ial series." 1 only add, that as the first gifts of this godare intellectual, lo his last pertain to the acquisition of ain.

It is remarkable thatnot one of the translators of Homer has noticed the manner inwhich the Eleatis understood the :v -.vyjj in one of these lines.For by the Latin translators It is rendered ad portam inferorum,i. c. at the gate of the infernal regions; and the English harefollowed the Latin translators.

session: but Latona and Diana appease the anger ofApollo, and Minerva that of Hercules. This too was thegift of the Phocenses, which they dedicated at that timewhen the Elean Tellias led the '1 hessalians against them.The other statues were made in common by Diyllus andAmyclxus ; but Minerva and Diana were made byChion.They fay that these artists were Corinthians. The Delphitoo report, that, when Hercules the son of Amphitryoncame to this oracle, the prophet •Xenocleas was unwillingto give him an answer to his interrogation, because he waspolluted with the slaughter of Iphitus; but that Herculestook up the tripod, and carried it out of the temple j uponwhich the prophet said : " This is a Tirynthian Hercules,and not Canobeus." For prior to this an Egyptian Her­cules came to Delphos But then the son of Amphitryonrestored the tripod to Apollo, and was instructed by Xeno­cleas in whatever he was desirous of learning. And it isfrom this circumstance that poets have taken occasion tosing of the -contest between Hercules and Apollo for atripod. A golden tripod supported by a dragon of brasswas the gift of the Greeks in common, for the victorygained at Plattea. And even at present the brazen partof this offering remains entire ; but -the golden part wastaken away by the Phocensian commanders. The Taren-tines also sent to Delghos another tenth of the spoils takenfrom a barbarous people called the Pcucetii. And theseofferings were made by Onatas Æginetes and Calynthus.They consist of images of men on foot and on horseback.Opis king of the lapyges is represented giving assistanceto the Pcucetii, and resembles a person dying in the en­gagement.

Ac all such relations therefore are very far frombeing literally ti ue, we should consider them as fables in whichsome mysterious meaning is involved ;—a moaning which fromits sublime nature ought to be concealed froin the vulgar, as theireyes are too weak to sustain the splendours of the highest truths.By ravishment and adultery then between divine and human na­tures, ancient theologilts meant to insinuate that communicationof energy between the two which we have taken notice of in aformer note, in which we shewed how heroes may be laid to herthe sons of go'Js :wd goddesses.

chus; and the statues which they contain are made of
wood. Whom these were made by, I cannot by any means
conjecture.
The Bulidii denominate that god, whom they venerateabove all others, the greatest : and in my opinion, this is anappellation of Jupiter. They have likewise a fountainwhich they call Saunion. But to Cirrha, which is a havenof the Delphi, there is a road from Delphos of sixty stadiain length. When you descend into the plain, you will feea Hippodrome in which the equestrian Pythian games arecelebrated. With respect to the Taraxippos in Olympia,I have related the particulars concerning it in my accountof the Elean affairs. But in this Hippodrome of Apollo,the charioteers sometimes meet with accidents that occa­sion sorrow, as the Dæmon in every undertaking distri­butes to men, sometimes prosperous, and sometimes ad­verse events. However, in this Hippodrome there isnothing which terrifies the horses, and the origin of whichmight be referred to the anger of some hero, or to someother cause. But the plain which commences fromCirrha is entirely destitute of trees, whether they are un­willing to plant any in it through a certain dire execration,or whether this arises from the inaptitude of the foil.They fay that this city, which is called Cirrha at present,was thus denominated from the nymph Cirrha. How­ever, Homer in the Iliad, and in his hymn to Apollo, callsthis city by its ancient name Crissa.
But in after times, when the inhabitants of Cirrha actedin other respects impiously towards Apollo, and laid waste,the country sacred to the god, the Amphictyons thoughtproper to war on the Cirrhxans, chose for the purposeClisth«ne8 the Sicyonian tyrant for their general, and• • brought

ico NOTES ON THE


on account os the greater preparation required in its celebration,was called the greater Panathcnaia; and the latter, on account ofits requiring a less apparatus, was denominated thelejfer Panatbe-naia. The ctlebration of them likewise was distinguished by-longer and sliorter periods of time. In the greater Panathenaia,too, the veil of the goddess was carried about, in which, faysProclus, the giants were represented vanquished by the Olym­pian gods. Proclus farther informs us (in Tim. p. 26.) thatthese festivals signified the beautiful order wfcich proceeds intothe world from intellect, and the unconfused distinction of mun­dane contrarieties. But what are we to understand by the veilof the goddess, and the victory obtained over the giants? I an­swer, Her veil is an emblem of that one life or nature of theuniverse, which, as Proclus observes, the goddess weaves, by thoseintellectual vital powers which her essence contains: and the bat­tle of the giants against the Olympian gods, signifies the oppo­sition between the last demiurgic powers of the universe (orthose powers which partially fabricate and proximately presideover mundane natures), and such as are first. But Minerva issaid to have vanquished the giants, because she rules over theseultimate artificers of things, by her unifying powers,
Page 85. Ar 'ifle and Call\Jle.~\ That is, hejl and miji beautiful.It appears to me, that Diana was thus denominated from herintimate alliance with Apollo: for Proclus, in his MSS. Scholiaon the Cratylus, informs us that there is a great correspondencebetween the Coric* or virginal series, and the Apolloniacal."For (fays he) the former is the unity of the middle triad ofrulers, i. e. of the supermundane gods, and emits from herselfvivisic powers: but the latter converts the solar principles to oneunion: and the solar principles are allotted a subsistence imme-
* Thisseries constitutes the vivisic triad of supermundane gods, and con­sists of Diana, Proserpine, and Minerva; or, according Co the Chaldasantheologists, of Hecate, Soul, and Virtue, which are only different namesof the fame powers. >

These two commanders, Orejhriusand Combutis, ailed towards the Callienses in a manner themojl impious ive ever heard of, and at the fame time in norespect similar to the during wickedness of men. For theyflew all the males in the city, young as well as old, togetherwith infants at their mothers' Ireafls; and drank the bl edand ate thejlejh of such infants as the nutriment of milk hadrendered in a more thriving condition. On this occasion, suchwomen and virgins in the sower of their age, as were of asuperior courage, defrosed themselves; but the Barbarianstreated such as survived with the utmof} insolence and vio­lence, as being a nation naturally incapable of pity, and averseto love.
Many indeed of these women voluntarily rushed onthe swords of the Gauls. Others again, not long after,died through hunger and wakefulnefs, in consequence ofthe insolence and violence of the Barbarians, who some­times satisfied their lust on the bodies of the dying, andsometimes on the bodies of the dead, but the Ætolianshaving learnt from certain messengers the calamities whichhad befallen their country, immediately with all possiblecelerity led back their forces from Thermopylæ to Ætolia;being enraged at the sufferings of the Callienses, and de­siring to save those cities which had not yet experiencedthe fury of the barbarous enemy. All that were of anage capable of bearing arms came into the camps of theÆtolians from all their cities; and with these old menwere mingled, who were impelled both by necessityand their pristine courage.

parts of the earth In which the oracles were given then becametoo impure to receive the prophetic inspiration. For, as wehave observed in a former note, there must be a concurrence ofproper instruments, times, and places, in order to receive divine in­fluence in a proper manner; so that when all or any of these arewanting, this influence will either be not at all received, or will bereceived mingled with the delusions of error. But let the l eaderwho desires popular conviction of this important fact, that therewas no collusion in general in the ancient oraclce, peruse the firstbook of Cicero De Divinationc \ and unless his intellectual eye isdreadfully Winded by the darkness of perseS at'hcism, which hasnow spread itself among all ranks of men, he must be at least con­vinced that they were not produced by the knavery of priests.That the priests indeed were sometimes corrupted, the passagebefore us of Pausanias, and many other instances which mightbe adduced, sufficiently prove; but this does not in the least in­validate the existence of divine influence, or the reality of ora­cular prediction; because the best thing3 always have been andalways will be perverted, through the weakness and viciousnessof the bulk of mankind.

turned from their villages to their pristine habitations.We must however except those cities which, by reasonof their imbecility from the first, and their indigence atthat time, could not be rebuilt. The Athenians and The-bans, prior to the loss of the Greeks at Chacronca, werethe leaders of this restoration. The Phocenses likewisepartook of the engagement at Chæronea, and afterwards,at Lamia and Cranon, sought against Antipater and theMacedonians. They opposed too the Gauls and the Celticarmy, with greater alacrity than the rest of the Greeks,that they might revenge the injury which had been offeredto the Delphic Apollo, and, as it appears to me, that theymight apologize for their pristine guilt. And such arcthe memorable transactions of the Phocenses.

The inhabitants dwellin wooden houses, resembling the cottages in mountains,and these are situated near a chasm made by a torrent.They have boundaries too which separate them fromtheir neighbours; and they send members to the Phocicconvention.

by the Thessalians. But at that time the Thessalians, beingfrustrated in their attempts to take Ceressus, sent to Del-phos in order to consult the god, and received the follow­ing oracle: "Shady Leuctra and the Alesian soil are theobjects of my care. My attention likewise is directed tothe sorrowful daughters of Scedasus. For on their accounta lamentable war will arise. Nor shall any man surviveto relate it, till the Dores shall lose a beautiful youngvirgin, when her fatal hour is arrived: for then, but nototherwise, Ceressus may be taken." Epaminondas, there­fore, having taken Ceressus, and the Thespians who hadfled thither for refuge being expelled, turned his attentionto the affairs of Peloponnesus, the Arcadians with greatalacrity calling upon him for this purpose.
On his first arrival therefore among the Pelopdnne-sians, he voluntarily joined himself to the Argives, as hisassociates in war; brought back the Mantinenfes to theirancient city, who were dispersed in towns about Agesi-polis; and persuaded the Arcadians to destroy their smalltowns, which, as they were unfortified, might easily betaken, and to assemble together in one city which hebuilt for them, and which is even at present called Mega­lopolis. When the time of his command too was expired,and which to continue any longer was a capital offence,he despised the law by which this custom was established,as being then unseasonable, retained his command, andmarched with an army to Sparta: but finding that Agesi-laus was not willing to come to an engagement, he turnedhis attention to the restoration of Meffene. Hence, Epa­minondas was the restorer of those Messenians that existat present; the particulars of which affair I have relatedin my Messenics. In the mean time, the Theban allies

Pelops, or cities for the sins of individuals, to a mind unenlighten­ed by sublime philosophy, must appear highly absurd and unjust.But if we direct our attention to the pre-exi Hence of human souls,and consider that many are punished in the present, for offence*which they have committed in a former life; and that those,whose guilt is of a similar kind, are by the wife administrationof providence brought together, so as to form one family, orone city, the apparent absurdity in this doctrine immediatelyvanishes, and the equity of divine veigeance becomes conspi­cuous. Proc'.us, in his book entitled Ten Doubts concerningProvidence, informs us tiiat the inyjhrics evince that certain per­sons are punist.cd for the crimes of their progenitors, and thatgods who preside over expiations, *wioi 6i«, free offending fouls

learnt from report, how injuriously the Gauls had treatedthe Thessalians at that time. It was therefore the unani­mous opinion both of individuals and cities, thar theymust either perish, or subdue the enemy. Any one whois so disposed, may easily enumerate those Grecian citieswhich opposed Xerxes at Thermopylæ, and those whichtook up arms against the Gauls. For the Greeks thatmarched against the Mede were these: The Lacedæmo­nians, who were not more than three hundred, under thecommand of Leonidas; five hundred of the Tegeatæ, andas many from Manlinea. One hundred and twenty Or-chomenians were sent from Arcadia: a thousand from theether cities of Arcadia: eighty from Mycena: and twohundred from Phlius. The Corinthians sent twice thisnumber. There were seven hundred from Bceotia: andfrom Thespia andThcbes four hundred. Five hundred ofthe Phoccnses guarded the pafcges of mount Oeta. And!such was the number of the forces that assembled on thisoccasion, according to the genera! opinion cf the Greeks.For Herodotus does n&t mention the number of the Lo-crians who live under the mountain Cnemis; but onlyfays, that the Greeks assembled together from all theircities on this occasion. We may however conjecture thenumber os these very near the truth. For the Athenians inthe battle at Marathon opposed the enemy with not morethan nine thousand men, in which, those whose age ren­dered them useless for the purposes of war, and servantswere ranked. It follows, therefore, that the band ofLocrians which came to Thermopylæ, could not at themost amount to more than six thousand men. And hence,the whole army must have amounted to eleven thousandtwo hundred men.

the comet flowed downwards, being of a watry nature, and inthis respect corresponding to tears. The Heliades were changedinto poplar trees, because a juice distills from the poplar treesimilar to amber; and amber has a golden splendour; and goldis dedicated to the Sun. The fable therefore obscurely signifiesthat the juice of the poplar tree is produced from moisture simi­lar to that which was produced by the dissolution of the comet.

But the following ac­count of a Ihip constructed by Ptolemy Philopater, from Plutarchin his Life of that great commander Demetrius, abundantly provesthe truth of what I have advanced. "Before the time of De­metrius, fays he, there had not been seen a galley with Jiftten orJixteen banks of oart. But after Demetrius, Ptolemy Philopaterbuilt a prodigious galley of eighty banks of oars. It was twohundred and eighty cubits in length. Its height from the waterto the top of the stern was forty-eight cubits. It had fourhundred mariners, and four thousand rowers: and besides all this,there was convenient standing for nearly three thousand soldiersto fight above the decks." It is true that Plutarch adds, thisunwitldy hulk was «nly fit for mew, and not for service; but itassords a very convincing proof, that the ancients had concep­tions of framing much larger (hips than any of the present time;and it appears to me, that the sixteen-oared gallep of Demetrius,mentioned by Plutarch, must have been at least as large as ourfirst rate men of war.

For in Mysia above Caicus there isa small city which is called Pioniae. They fay that thiscity was built by Pionis, who was one of the posterity ofHercules. While they are celebrating his funeral rites, asmoke rises spontaneously from the sepulchre: and of thisI have been a spectator The Thebans too exhibit thesepulchre of Tiresias, which is at the distance of abouttwenty stadia from the sepulchre of the sons of Oedipus.But they acknowledge that Tiresias died in Haliartia : theylikewise own that the sepulchre which they shew of himis merely honorary. The Thebans too have a tomb ofHector the son of Priam, near the fountain which is calledOeoi podia. For they fay that his bones were broughthither from Troy, in consequence of the following oracle:"Thebans, who inhabit the city of Cadmus, if you wish toreside in your country, blest with the posseflion of blame­less wealth, bring the bones of Hector the son of Priaminto your dominions from Asia, and reverence the heroagreeably to the mandate of Jupiter." But the fountainOedipodia was thus denominated, because Oedipus washedoff in it the blood occasioned by the murder of his father.Near this fountain is the sepulchre of Asphodicus, who,according to the Thebans, flew Parthenopæus the son ofTalaus in an engagement with the Argives. For theverses in the Thebaid, respecting the death of Partheno­pæus, assert that he was slain by Periclymenus.

Many things indeed arereported of the Delphi, and particularly concerning theoracle of Apollo. For they fay that this oracle is themost ancient of any on the earth, that Daphne was chosenby Earth, priestess of the oracle, and that she was oneof the nymphs that inhabit mountains.
But the Greeks have a piece of poetical composition,which they call Eumolpra, and the author of which, theysay, was Musæus the son of Antiophemus. In this poemit is asserted that there is an oracle in common of Nep­tune and Earth; that Earth delivered her oracles fromher own mouth ; but that Neptune had Pyrcon for his in­terpreter. The verses respecting this affair are these:
"From her own mouth Earth utter'd prudent words,But Pyrcon was illustrious Neptune's priest."
They fay, that afterwards Earth gave her part of the oracleto Themis; but Themis to Apollo; and that Apollo re­ceived the other part from Neptune, in return for whichhe gave Neptune the island Calaurea which is situated be­fore Trcezen. I have also heard it asserted, that certain shep­herds who once happened to come to the oracle, becamedivinely inspired from the vapour of the earth, and pro­phesied through the influence of Apollo. But Phemonoearrived at the highest degree of celebrity, as being thefirst prophetess of the god, and the first that fang anhexameter verse.

Page 46. But it appears to me, that Homer, We should
rather say that Homer derived his knowledge respecting the soulsin Hades, and the names of the infernal rivers which it contains,from the mystic traditions of Orpheus, who instituted the religionof Greece, and that the rivers called Acheron and Cocytus inCichyrus were denominated from their similitude to those of thesame name in Hades. But the reader must not suppose that theinfernal rivers described by Homer are nothing more than theparadoxical sports of poetical fancy; but, as Proclus on Plato'sRepublic beautifully observes, it is proper to believe, that forthose who require chastisement and purification, subterraneanplaces are prepared, which, from their receiving the various de-fluxions of the elements above the earth, are called rivers by my-thologists, and are filled with dæmons who preside over fouls,and who are of an avenging, punishing, purifying, and, judicialcharacteristic Hence, says he, the poetry of Homer is not to becondemned, when it calls the infernal region a place
"Horrid and dark, and odious to the gods."
For the variety and imagination of the presiding dæmons exciteall this obscurity and horror. I only add, that Acheron is a placeadapted to the purgation of care and sorrow, and which als« cor­responds to air and the meridional part of the world; but thatCocytus together with Styx correspond to earth and thewestern centre, and punish hatred, through lamentations and,grief.

And Jupiter is seen holding a sceptre, and vifiory.]Jupiter is every where called by Homer as well as Orpheus,"the father of gods and men, ruler and ling, and the supreme osrulers, «mlo» xp«o»!4i»." On account therefore of his commandingor ruling characteristic, he is very properly represented with asceptre, which is certainly an obvious symbol of command. Thesymbol of victory likewise justly belongs to him, on account ofhis all-subduing power, which vanquishes all mundane opposi­tion, and causes the war of th,c universe to terminate in peace.Proclu8 on the Cratylus informs us, that his sceptre according toOrpheus was twenty-four measures in length, by which, fays he,the theologist signifies his establishing those two divine orders,the celestial and supercelestial, and his reigning over two series ofgods, each of which is characterised by the number twelve, yapitrlotf upipuri Jiaxeff-fiov;, tovT! ov^cuuo-j, kJ to» wireporgaue*. eSin aulou uiTo tnar/itToor urai tyna.v o 9io?iO>c$ viax'pa;* xa* Sixoa-i fifyw, aij o*t1v9 fl^-j^mIc?

I am persuaded that Ariadne received this statue fromDædalus, and that when she followed Theseus, she tookit along with her. The Delians fay, that Theseus, whenAriadne was taken from him, dedicated this wooden statueof Venus to the Delian Apollo, that he might not bytaking it home with him be reminded of his lost wife,and by this recollection continually experience new tor­ments of love. I do not know that any other works ofDædalus besides these remain. For those works of his■which the Argives dedicated in the temple of Juno, andthose which were brought to Gela in Sicily from Om-phace, have all been destroyed by time. The Chxronensesare next to the Lebadenses. The city of these people wasformerly called Arne: and they fay that Ame was thedaughter of Æolus, and that from her another city inTheflaly is denominated. They add, that the present nameof the Chæronenses was derived from Chæron the son ofApollo by Thero the daughter of Phylas : and this is con­firmed by the author of the poem called the Great Eoeæ,in the following verses: ,
"In wedlock with Deiphile conjoin'd,
Daughter of lolaus the renown'd,
And in whole person godlike beauties shene,
Phylas, in his august abodes begat
A son mm'd Ippotus, with Thero fair,
In form resembling Phaebe-5 splendid light:
And Thero from Apollo, Chæron bore,
Of mighty strength, and ikill'd the steed to tame." •

of the Lacedæmonians, turned his forces to Ambryssusin the land of the Phocenses; and having slain Chæreaswho guarded the passages in these parts, he penetratedas far as to Leuctra in Bœotia. But in this place divi­nity gave certain portentous signs in common to Cleom-brotus and the Lacedæmonians. For it was usual withthe Spartan kings, when they marched to battle, to takealong with them lheep, that they might sacrifice to thegods before the engagement began. The leaders of theseflieep were goats, which the shepherds call Cateiadai, orleaders of the flock. At that time, therefore, certain wolvesrushed on the shepherd, and slew the goats that were theleaders of the flock, but did not in any respect injurethe sheep.
It is also sajd, that the wrath of divinity was enkindledagainst the Lacedæmonians, through the daughters ofScedasus. For when Scedasus dwelt about Leuctra, hehad two daughters, Molpia and Hippo. These, when theywere in the flower of their age, were ravished by the Lace­dæmonians, Parathemidas, Phrudarchidas, and Parthenius.The virgins, indignantly bearing this injurious treatment,strangled themselves to death. And Scedasus when hecame to Lacedæmon, and could obtain no recompensefrom the Spartans,- flew himself. But then Epaminondasperformed funeral rites to Scedasus and his daughters,and solemnly declared, that he took up arms, not morefor the safety of the Thebans, than for the fake of re­venging the injuries which they had sustained. Theepinion, however, of some of the Bœotian commanders onthis subject did not correspond with that of Epaminondas:for though Malgis and Xenocrates were of opinion, thatwar should be denounced against the Lacedæmonians with

tiope), you will see the ruins of the house of Pindar, anda temple os the mother Dindymene, which was dedicatedby Pindar. The statue of the goddess was made by theThebans Aristomedes and Socrates. On one day in everyyear they think proper to open this temple. I happenedto be present on that day, and by this means had an oppor­tunity of seeing the statue, which is of Pentelican stone, aswell as the throne on which the goddess sits. In the roadfrom the gate Neitis there is a temple of Themis, andin it a statue of white stone. After this there are twotemples, one of the Parcæ, and the other of Judicial Ju­piter. The statue of Jupiter is of stone; but there areno statues of the Parcæ. At a small distance from hence,there is a statue of Hercules in the open air, under theappellation of Rinocoloujles, because, in order to disgracethose ambassadors (as the Thebans fay) that were sent bythe Orchomenians to demand tribute, he cut off theirnoses.
On proceeding to the distance of twenty-five stadiafrom hence, you will fee a grove of Cabirian Ceres andProserpine, into which the uninitiated are not permitted toenter. But who the Cabiri are, and what the ceremonieswhich are performed in honour of them, and the motherof the gods, I must beg those that are desirous of hearingsuch particulars to suffer me to pass over in silence. No­thing however hinders me from disclosing the origin ofthese mysteries according to the Thebans. They fay,then, that there was once a city in this place, and inha­bitants, who were called Cabiri; and that Ceres depo­sited something with Prometheus, who was one of theCabiri, and with his son Æt.næus, after she became ac­quainted with them.

NOTES ON THE


sul, to the secret meaning of much of the mythology id the Iliad,and shews us how the relation here given by Pausanias is to beunderstood. For it means, that certain dxmoniacal powers, whorank among the kst attendants of the gods Neptune and theSun, once contended with each other about the land of Corinth;and that Btiareus, a dæmon belonging to the deity of that name,acted as a mediator between them. I only add farther, thatthese demons, who are thus proximate to the subjects of theirgovernment, and who are influenced by paflions like men, arenot essentially dæmons, though they are the perpetual attendantsof the gods; but they are dæmons only cxca>,t according lohabitude, proximity, and alliance. For between essential dæmons,who are the ecn/lant attendants of the gods, and men who areonly sometimes damons according to habitude, and sometimes atten­dants of the gods, it is necessary there should be an order ofbeings, who are always dæmons according to habitude, and al­ways the attendants of the gods..
Page 14.1. But there are three Jlatves of Jupiter, fee.] It ap­pears to me highly probable, that the three Jupiters, mentionedin tliis place by Pausanias, are those three brother deities, theoffspring of Saturn, between whom, according to Homer, theuniverse is divided; or, in other words, that they are Jupiter,Neptune, and Pluto. For the second of these itatues, fays Pau­sanias, is called terrcjlrial Jupiter, which is an epithet of Pluto,as is evident from the Orphic hymn to that deity; and fromHomer, as cited by Pausanias, p. 204 ; and Neptune, in the Or­phic hymn to Equity, is called marine Jupiter, nrotlioc maXt^Zir;.Put that the reader may fee the processions and offices of thesethree demiurgic gods, who are supermundane deities accordingto their first subsistence, I shall present him with the followingtranslation from Proclus in Theol.

i8a THE DESCRIPTION


is a man. suffering punishment for sacrilege. A womanwell acquainted with poisons, and other instruments ofpunishment, is represented tormenting him. Men there-ifore at that tine were' remarkably pious towards thegods: and this the Athenians evinced when they rook thetemple of Olympian Jupiter among the Syracusans; forthey .did not move any of die sacred offerings, and sufferedthe Syraciisan priest who guarded the offerings still tocontinue his office. This too the Mede Datis evinced:for having found a statue of Apollo in a Phœnician ship,, he immediately gave it to the Tanagræans to be carriedback to Delium. So that at that time all men venerateda divine nature; and Polygnotus well knowing this,painted the man suffering in Hades for sacrilege. Abovethose which we have now enumerated is Euryhomus,who, according to the Delphic interpretersr of sacred con-?cerns, is one of the dæmons belonging to Hades, and whoeats the flesh of dead bodies, so as to leave the bonesquite bare. However, neither Homer in the Odyssey, northe poetical composition which is called Minyas, nor theverses which are denominated No/hi, or the Return (for inthese there is an account of Hades and its terrors), makeany mention of the dæmon Eurynomus I shall thereforedescribe the figure of Eurynomus as he appears in thispicture. His colour is between azure and black, and islike that of flies which irifest meat. He shews his teethjand firs on the skin of a vulture. Auge and Iphimedea fromArcadia present themselves to the view after Eurynomus.Auge came to MyGa, which is near Tcuthras, and is saidto have brought forth a son the most like his father, ofall the women with which Hercules wr.s connected. Buithe Carians in Mylessæ pay great honours to Iphimedea.2 CHAP,

name. The Platæcnses therefore celebrate this Dædalfestival, every seventh year, as an historian of this coun­try told me: in reality, however, the interval of timebetween its celebration is not so long. But though I wus■desirous of accurately numbering the interval of rime from•one Dædal festival to another, I was not able to accom­plish my design. They celebrate this festival in the fol­lowing manneri—There is a grove, which is the greatestin Bceotia, not far from Alalcomenæ; and in this placethere are many ancient oaks. The Platæenfes cominginto this grove, place in it portions of boiled flesh. Andthey have but little trouble indeed to defend it from otherbirds, but they are obliged to guard it diligently from thecrows j and if any one of these birds carries oft" any por­tion of the flesh, they observe on what tree it perches,cut down this tree, and make from -it a Dædalian statue z/or they call the statue thus made Dædalian.
This festival the Platæenfes celebrate -privately, andcall it the lesser Dædali: for the Bœotians celebrate thegreater Dædala in a very public manner, every sixtiethyear. They fay that the festival was omitted for solong a tim? when the Platæenfes were driven from theirnative country. And in the lesser Dædala, indeed, theyprepare fourteen statues every year; and these the Platæ­enfes, Coronæi, Thespienses, Tanagræi, Chæronenses,Orchomenii, Lebadenses, and Thebans, take away by lot.For these people thought proper to be reconciled with thePlatæenfes, to partake of their common assembly, and tofend a victim to tlie Dædal festival, when Thebes was re­stored by Cassander the son of Antipater. But those citieswhich are of less estimation bestow their gifts upon thisfestival according to lot. They carry the image to Aso-

4 THE DESCRIPTION


Toured by every possible means to accomplish their de­struction, and at last restored the Platæcnses to their an­cient habitations.


UN turning a little to the right hand from the straightroad of the Platxan land under Cithæron, you will fee theruins of Hysia and Erythræ. These were once cities ofthe Bœotians; and even now among the ruins of Hysiathere is a temple of Apollo, the half of which is entire,and a sacred well. According to the Bœotians, formerlythose that drank out of this well were endowed with thegift of prophecy. Proceeding from hence into the publicroad, you will again fee, on the right hand, that whichis called the sepulchre of Mardonius. Indeed that thedead body of Mardonius could no where be found afterthe battle in which he fell, is generally acknowledged;nor can they tell by whom he was buried. It appears,however, that Artontes, the son of Mardonius, gave greatgifts to Dionysophanes the Ephefian, and to others be­longing to the Ionians, that they might not be negligentwith respect to the interment of Mardonius. And thisroad leads from Eleutheræ to Platæa. But as you pro­ceed from Megaree, you will fee on the right hand afountain, and a little beyond this a stone, which they callthe stene of Actæon: for they fay that Actaion used tosleep on this, when he was weary with hunting; and thatin this place he (aw Diana washing herself in the neigh­bouring fountain. But Stesichorus Himeræus writes, thatDiana threw upon Actæon a stag's hide, and thus causedhim to be slain by his dogs, that he might not marry

by alway9 descending into generation. It is therefore by nomeans wonderful, that Hercules, who was born with intellectualprerogatives so much superior to the bulk of mankind, shouldeven from his infancy have been remarkably united with divinenatures, and thus may be said to have vanquished a partial life,which is implied by his strangling dragons in his infancy. I onlyadd farther concerning Hercules at present, that as he descendedfrom Jupiter, it appears to me that his life was both politic andphilosophic, and this in the highest degree possible to humannature.
Page 67. Minerva rifing from tht head of Jupiter,,] Minerva,as Plato beautifully observes in the Cratylus, is deific intelligence:and hence she is said to have proceeded from the head of Jupiter,or the demiurgic intellect, by which the world was produced,because she is the progeny of the deific intelligence of this intellect,which is the very summit, flower, and as it were head of Jupiter.
Ibid. 67. For they first of all denominated Minerva Ergane.]Ergane meanS artificer: and the propriety of this appellationmust be obvious to every one, from what we observed in the pre­ceding note; I mean, that she is the immediate progeny of theartificer of the universe.
Page 68. Jupiter, -who it denominated Polieus.'] Polieus meansthe guardian of a city; and this is a very proper epithet of Ju­piter, because he is the cause of a politic and philosophic life.
Page 69. In her hand she holds a spear, a shield lies at her feet,and near her spear there is a dragon, -which may perhaps le Erich -thonius; and at the base os the fiatue the generation os Pandora itrepresented.^ The spear of Minerva is a symbol of that all-per-Tading power, through which the gods without control areenabled to pervade the universe, to aid sublunary forms, and toamputate base matter. Her shield signifies that untamed power,which first appears in her essence, and from thence becomes aninvincible defence to the gods; through which they remain securefrom passion, and reign over the universe triumphant and pure.

He therefore that dcspiled the mysteries d< spisedthe means of becoming internally pure, and in consequence of thisboth here and hereafter might be said to live in Hades, and tobe employed in pouring water out of one perforated vessel intoanother. For such a one lived in obscurty, through being in astate of servitude to the body; and was continually busied in en­deavouring to satisfy the indigence osdefirei with the flowing na­ture of a corporeal life, which glides away as fast as it is receivedinto the foul from one desire to another, and leaves nothing behindbut the ruinous clefts through which it passed.

Semele. For my own part, I can easily beliere that Ac-tæon might be torn in pieces by his dogs, without the in­terference of the goddess, in consequence of their rushingfuriously upon him, without perceiving who he was.
In what part of Cithæron the destruction of Pentheusthe son of Echion happened, or where Oedipus when hewas born was exposed, is not known by any one; thoughI am not ignorant of the bisected road belonging to thePhocenses, in which Oedipus flew his father. But themountain Cithæron is sacred to Jupiter Cithæronius, ofwhich I shall speak more copiously when my discourseleads me to mention it again. Near the entrance toPlatæa, you may perceive the sepulchres of those thatfought against the Medes. The other Greeks indeed haveone common sepulchre: but the Lacedæmonians andAthenians that fell in that battle have separate tombs;and upon them there are elegies composed by Simonides.Not far from the common sepulchre of the Greeks, thereis an altar of Jupiter Eleutherius. The sepulchre is madeof brass; but the altar and statue of Jupiter are of whitestone. Even at present, every fifth year, they celebratethe festivals called Eleutheria, in which the greatest re­wards are proposed for the race. They run before thealtar armed. The trophy which the Greeks erected fortheir victory over the Platæenscs, is about fifteen stadiadistant from the city. When you enter the city, in thatpart which contains the altar and statue of EleutherianJupiter, you will see the heroic monument of Platæa.What the Platæenscs report concerning her, I have al­ready related- The Platæenscs too have a temple of Junowhich deserves to be inspected, both for its magnitude,pud the ornament of the statues which it contains.

not able to describe her statue, because they only thinkproper to open the temple twice a year.
They say that such victims as are selected for Dianaare not afflicted with any disease, and grow fatter by feed­ing than other cattle. But not only the road to Delphos,or Daulis, through Panopeus, leads from Chæronea toPhocis, and to the road which is called Scissa ; but anotherroad, which is rough, and for the most part mountainous,conducts you from Chæronea to a city of the Phocenses,which is called Stiris. The length of this road is aboutone hundred and twenty stadia. The inhabitants of thiscity fay, that they were formerly Athenians, and thatbeing expelled the Attic land, together with Peteus theson of Orneus by Ægeus, they settled in this place. Theyadd, that the city was called Stiris, because a great partos those that followed Peteus belonged to the StirienscsBut the habitation of the Stirienses is in an elevated androcky place; and hence in summer they are in want ofwater. For they have neither many wells, nor is th»water which they afford fit to be drunk. It serves how­ever for baths, and supplies beasts of burthen with drink.The inhabitants indeed fetch the water which they drinkfrom a fountain which is about four stadia distant fromthe town, and which is dug out of a rock. They are there­fore obliged to descend in order to obtain this water. InStiris too there is a temple of Ceres, who is called Stiritis.This temple is raised from crude tiles; but the statue ofthe goddess is made of Pentelican stone, and has torches,in its hands. Near it there is another statue, which isancient, and adorned with fillets.

Hermes received from Jupiter, and gave to Pelops; Pe-Jops left it to Atreus; Atreus to Thyestes; and ,fromThyestes it came to Agamemnon. This sceptre too theydenominate the spear; and indeed that it contains some­thing of a nature more divine than usual, is evident fromhence, that a certain splendor is seen proceeding from it.TheChaeroneans fay, that this sceptre was found in the bor­ders of the Panopeans in Phocis, and together with it aquantity of gold ; and that they cheerfully took the sceptreinstead of the gold. I am persuaded that it was broughtby Electra the daughter of Agamemnon to Phocis. Thereis nor however any temple publicly raised for this sceptre,but every year the person to whose care this sacred sceptreis committed, places it in a building destined to this pur­pose; and the people sacrifice to it every day, and placenear it a table full of all kinds of flesh and sweetmeats.

Of all the works indeed of Vulcan, which are cele­brated by poets, and praised by the rest of mankind, thissceptre of Agamemnon is the only thing which deservesour belies. For the Lycians, who shew in Pataræ in thetemple os Apollo a brazen bowl, which they say was de­dicated by Telephus, and made by Vulcan, are ignorantthat the Samians, Theodorus, and Rhoecus were thefirst brass-founders. The Achaian Patrenses, too, pretendthat the chest which Eurypylus brought from Troy wasmade by Vulcan, but in reality they have no such cheltto sliew. In Cyprus there is a city called Amathus j and

And hence, at presentthis temple is in the most ruinous condition of all thebuildings which have been injured by fire. For this temple,which had been injured by the Persian fire, was afterwardsinjured in a still greater degree by that of the Bœotians.Near this great temple there is another temple, which isnot so large: and this was dedicated by the emperorAdrian to Apollo.
The Abæans however have statues more ancient thantheir temples, and which they themselves dedicated. Althese statues are brazen, are in an erect position, and areApollo, Latona, and Diana. The Abæans too have atheatre and a forum, both which are of ancient work­manship. But on returning into the straight road to Opus,you will arrive at Hyampolis. The name of this city in­dicates the origin of its inhabitants, and the place fromwhich they fled to this country. For the Hyantes beingvanquished by Cadmus and his associates, fled from Thebeeinto these parts. And at first, indeed, their city wascalled by the neighbouring people the city of the Hyantes;but in process of time it came to be denominated Hyam­polis. This city was burnt by Xerxes, and afterwards en­tirely subverted by Philip. Yet notwithstanding this, the or­naments of the ancient forum still remain—a Bouhuterion,or place of consultation, and a theatre not far from the gates.But the emperor Adrian built a porch here, which bears hisname. The inhabitants of this city have but one well; andthey have no other water besides this, either for bathingor drinking, except the rain water which they collect inwinter. They venerate too Diana beyond all the divini­ties; and they have a temple of this goddess. But I am

"When Phocus the son of Æacus passed over fromÆgina to that country which is now called Phocis, andobtained the government of that part of the continent,Iascus contracted a great friendship with him, and gavehim things suitable to his dignity, and a stone seal set ingold. But Phocus not long after this returning to Ægina,lost his life through the stratagems of Peleus. On thisaccount, therefore, in the picture, Iascus is desirous thatthe seal may be considered as a monument of his friend­ship j and Phocus very readily suffers him to take it offhis singer, that he may prove his friendlhip by shewing it.Above these is Mæra, sitting on a stone.

Lastly, it is said that the inter­pretation of the oracle was given to Oedipus in a dream,who was by this means enabled to solve the riddle ofSphinx.
The ruins of the city Onchestus are about fifteen stadiadistant from this mountain: and they fay that Onchestusthe son of Neptune once dwelt in this city. At present,indeed, a temple and statue of Onchestian Neptune re­main: and there is likewise a grove here which is cele­brated by Homer. On turning from the temple of theCabiri to the left hand, and proceeding to the distance ofabout fifty stadia, you will arrive at the city Thefpia, whichis situated under mount Helicon, and is said to havebeen denominated from Thefpia the daughter of Asopus.According to some, Thespius, when he left Athens, gavethis name to the city; and they fay that he was the sonof Erechtheus. Among the Thespians, there is even atpresent a brazen statue of Jupiter the Saviour. They re­port, that the city being once infested with a dragon, Ju­piter ordered them to expose every year to the savage ani­mal certain young men chosen by lot; and that the namesof those that perished except one sunk into oblivion.

But among the Chæronenses there are two trophies,which were raised by the Romans and Sylla, when theyvanquished Taxilus and the army of Mithridates. Philip,however, the son of Amyntas, neither raised any trophyat Chxronca, nor for any victories which he gained overcither Greeks or Barbawans. For it was not an establishedcustom with the Macedonians, to leave trophies as monu­ments cf their victories. It is said too by the Macedo­nians, that Caranus, when he reigned iii Macedonia, havingvanquished in battle Cisseus, who governed the countrybordering on the Macedonians, raised a trophy after themanner of the Argives. But they add, that a lion rushingfrom Olympus, threw down and destroyed the trophy.That Caranus was conscious he had not acted prudently,because by raising this trophy he had occasioned an irrecon-cileablc enmity with his neighbours; and that afterwardsneither Caranus nor any of his successors raised a trophy,that t'^.ey might at some suture time attract to themselvesthe benevolence of the neighbouring people. Alexanderconfirms the truth of this account, because he neitherraised a trophy for his victories over Darius, nor for hisconquest of the Indies. Near this city there is a com­mon sepulchre of those Thebans that fell in the engage­ment against Philip. There is no inscription on the tomb,but a lion stands on it, which may be supposed to signifythe great vehemence os these men in fight. But it ap­pears to me that there is no inscription on the sepulchre,because the Dæmon did not permit the consequences ofthdv courage to be such as might be expected.

The roof issufficiently elevated above the ground: and the caverncontains many fountains of water; but a still greaterquantity of water trickles from its top ; so that the vestigesof drops of water may be seen throughout the cavern.The inhabitants of Parnassus are of opinion, that thiscavern-is particularly sacred to the Corycian nymphs andto Pan. But from hence to the summits of Parnassus, theroad to a man lightly clothed is difficult. For the sum­mits of this mountain are above the clouds; and the Thy-iades, agitated with divine fury, sacrifice on these summit*to Bacchus and Apollo. Tithorea too is about eightystadia distant from Delphos, to one who is travellingthrough Parnassu*. The road is not entirely mountain­ous •, but that part of it which may be passed through bycarriages is said to be longer by some stadia. As to thename of the city, I know that Herodotus, in that part ofhis history in which he gives an account of the irruptionof the Persians into Greece, differs from what is assertedin the oracles of Bacis. For Bacis calls these people Ti-thorenscs; but Herodotus fays, that when the Barbariansinvaded this country, the inhabitants fied to the summitof Parnassus; and he calls the city Neon, and the summitof Parnassus Tithorea. It appears, therefore, that all thecountry was at first called Tithorea; but that in processof time, when the inhabitants collected themselves intoone city, that which was once called Neon came to bedenominated Tithorea.The natives fay, that this name was derived from the

Near the statue os Gorgias is the Scionean ScyHis,who was renowned for heing able to descend into themost profound parts of every sea. He taught his daughterCyana this art of diving. Both of them, therefore, whenthe fleet of Xerxes was tolled about by a violent tempestnear mount Pelion, brought destruction on the three-oared galleys of the Persians, by cutting away the ropesthat held the anchors, or any thing else that fastened theships under water. Hence, in memorial of this achieve­ment, the Amphictyons dedicated his statue, and that ofhis daughter. Among the statues which Nero took fromDelphos, was the statue of Cyana. Women, while theyare yet pure virgins, are said to descend with safety intothe sea. But here it is proper that I should relate whatis reported pf Lesbos. Certain Methymnæan fishermendrew up out of the sea in their nets a head made fromthe olive-tree. This head seemed to have something di­vine in its form, but such as was foreign, and not agree­able to the figure of the Grecian gods. The Methym-næans, therefore, inquired of the Pythian deity of whatgod or hero this head was the image, and received foranswer, that they should venerate Bacchus Cephallen.Hence the Methymnæans kept the wooden head whichthey drew out of the sea, venerated it with sacrifices andprayers, and sent a brazen image instead of it to Delphos.In the roof of the temple there are Diana, Latona, Apollo,the Muses, the setting Sun, Bacchus, and the women who

But to return to thegifts in the temple, the Thebans and Athenians havededicated here treasuries, in consequence os success inwar. I do nos however know, whether the Gnidiansbuilt their treasury in consequence of any victory, or forthe purpose of shewing the prosperous condition of thei*affairs. For the Thebans dedicated treasuries on accountof the victory which they gained at Leuctra, and theAthenians for their success at Marathon. But the Cleonæibeing afflicted with a pestilence in the fame manner asthe Athenians, by the admonition of the Delphic oracle,immolated a goat to the rising fun, and, when they wereby this means freed from their malady, sent a brazengoat to Apollo. After these follow the gifts of the Poti-dæatæ in Thrace, and of the Syracusans. These last senta treasury to the temple, on account of the great victorywhich they obtained over the Athenians: but the Poti-dicatæ sent a treasury as a testimony of their piety to thegod. The Athenians too have dedicated a porch, fromthe spoils which they took from the Peloponnesians andtheir Grecian allies- In this place likewise the orna­ments belonging to the extremities of ships are dedicated,and together with them brazen shields. The inscriptionon these mentions the cities from which the Athenianssent the first fruits of their spoils, viz. Elis, Lacedæmon,Sicyon, Megara, the Pellenenses, the Achaians, Ambracia,Leucas, and Corinth They sacrifice to Theseus for thesenaval victories, and to Neptune whom they call Qrios.

For ancient theologtflscalled the processions of any divinity to the lad of things, ac­cording to different orders and degrees, mutations. So that thefable, by asserting that Chiron was the son of Caturn by one ofthe nymphs of the ocean, signifies that a Saturnian dæmon and anymph co-operated with the parents of Chiron, by a certain na­tural sympathy, in begetting him.

"It is said that Discord, ata banquet of the gods, threw a golden apple, and that a disputeabout it arising among* the goddesses, they were sent by Jupiterto take the judgment of Paris, who, charmed with the beautyof Venus, gave her the apple in preference to the rest. In thisfable, the banquet denotes the supermundane powers of thegods; and on this account they subsist in conjunction with eachother; but the golden apple denotes the world, which, on ac­count of its composition from contrary natures, is not improperlysaid to be thrown by Discord, or Strife. But again, since dif­ferent gists are imparted to the world by different gods, theyappear to contest with each other for the apple.

For as it was necessarythat the soul should descend to these lower regions, but, beingincorporeal and divine, it was impossible for her to be conjoinedwith body without a medium, hence she becomes united with itthrough the irrational foul.

They add, that the pastures here even ie-bilitate the venom of serpents; so that those who are fre­quently bit by serpents in this part, escape the dangerwith greater ease than if they were of the nation of thePsylli, or had discovered an antidote against poison. Other­wise the venom of the fiercest of serpents is both destruc­tive to men, and all other animals. The nature of thepastures too contributes in no small degree to the strengthof the venom. For I once heard a Phœnician fay, that inthe mountainous part of Phœnicia, the roots that growthere render the vipers more fierce. The fame person toofarther added, that he saw a viper pursue a man who fledto a tree for shelter, aud that the viper blew its venomagainst the tree to which the man had escaped, and bythis means caused his death. With respect to those vipersin Arabia which take up their residence among balsamtrees, I know that something very different from what Ihave above related happens, and this is as follows: Thebalsam tree is nearly of the fame size as a sprig of myrtle;and its leaves are like those of the herb sweet-marjoram.Vipers take up their residence about these plants; and arein some places more numerous than in others: for thejuice of the balsam tree is their sweetest food; and theyare delighted with the (hade produced by its leaves.When the time therefore arrives for gathering the juiceof this tree, the Arabians come into the sacred grove,each of them holding two twigs. By shaking these theyput to flight the vipers: for they are unwilling to killthem, because they consider them as the sacred inhabitantsof the balsam. And if it happens that any one is woundedby a viper, the wound resembles that which is rhadc byiron, but is not attended with any dangerous conse­quences:

told by a Delphic oracle, that when he should see rainfalling from a serene sky, he would then possess a landand city. But as he was not able by himself to discoverthe meaning os the oracle, and did not consult any inter-rpreter, he sailed with a fleet to Italy. Here having conrquered the Barbarians, but neither obtaining any land orcity, he recollected the oracle, and was of opinion thatthe *god had predicted that which could not be accom­plished ; as it appeared to Iv m impossible that there mouldbe rain when the sky was clear and serene. His wife,however, when he was in a desponding condition (forhe had returned home), endeavoured to console him byher endearing officiousness; and as she was once support­ing his head on her knees, and freeing it from vermin,through a benevolent concern for the adverse situation ofhis affairs she began to weep •, and her tears, as she weptabundantly, fell on the head of her husband, who thenperceived the meaning of the oracle: for his wife's namewas Æthra, which is the Greek word for a strent Jiy.On the following night therefore he took Tarentum, agreat and most flourishing maritime city of the Barbarians.They fay, indeed, that the hero Taras was the son ofNeptune, by a nymph, a native of Tarentum; and thatfrom the hero both a city and river are denominatedTaras,

"In Dalmatia too, in that which is called the cavern of Diana,many bodies may be seen, whose tiba exceed sixteen cubits.
"But the grammarian Apollonius relates that there was anearthquake during the reign of Tiberius Nero, through whichmany celebrated cities of Asia were entirely destroyed, but whichTiberius afterwards rebuilt at his own expence; for which bene­fit the Asiatics made a colossal statue of him, and placed it nearthe temple of Venus, which is in the forum of the Romans: andafter this, they placed the statues of the several cities that hadbeen rebuilt. Not a few too of the cities of Sicily sufferedthrough this earthquake, and places near Rhegilfm, togetherwith several of the cities in Pontus. But in those parts in whichthe earth was rent asunder, very large dead bodies were found;the magnitude of which indeed so astonished the inhabitants,that they were unwilling to move them. That the affair how­ever might be generally known, they sent to Rome one of theteeth of these bodies; and this was more than a foot long. Theambassadors, at the fame time they shewed this to Tiberius, askedhim whether he wished that the hero to whom this tooth belong­ed should be brought to him. Upon this, Tiberius very pru­dently thought of a means by which he might neither be deprivedof knowing the dimensions of this body, nor yet be guilty ofthe impiety of robbing the dead. He ordered a celebrated ge­ometrician, whose name was Pulcrus, and whom he honoured forhis art, to be called, and desired him to make a face in propor­tion to the fize of that tooth. The geometrician therefore,having calculated from the fize of the tooth the dimensions ofthe face and of the whole body, accomplished the taste imposedon him with great celerity, and brought the face to the Emperor,who, after he had satisfied himself with beholding it, ordered thetooth to be restored to the place from whence it was taken.
"Nor ought we to refuse our assent to this narration, since thereIs a place in Egypt called Litiæ, in which bodies are to be seen,not less in size than the above-mentioned, and these not buried in

the people were denominated Orchomenians. Yet theappellation of Minyæ still remains, for the purpose of dis­tinguishing these people from the Orchomenians in Ar­cadia. Orchomenus therefore reigning, Hyettus came tohim from Argos; for this Hyettus was obliged to abandonhis country, on account of having murdered Molurus theson of Arisbas, whom he had detected committing adul­tery with his wife. Orchomenus gave this Hyettus, thatpart of the country which is about the village Hyettus,and the land adjoining to it. The author of the verseswhich the Greeks call the Great Eoeæ, makes mention«f Hyettus:
"Hyettus, when Arisbas' son he found,Molurus, in the chamber of his wife,Th' adult'rer slew, and ftoin his country fled,Argns, the fertile nurse of gen'rous steeds.To Minyas' son Orchomenus he came:The exile then th' heroic prince receiv'd,And nobly gave him of his realms a fliarc."
But it is evident, that this Hyettus was the first thatpunished adultery. For in after times Draco, among thelaws which he made for the Athenians, relative to thepunishment of unjust actions, enacted, that adultery shouldhe severely punished. The name too of the Minyæ arrivedat such a degree of dignity, that Neleus, the son of Cre-theus and king of Pylus, married from OrchomenusaAoris the daughter of Amphion the son of Hilasiust

Moon therefore, as well as many other divinities, is celebratedby the Orphic theologists as both male and female, perhaps Panis the masculine pow er of the moon: and this opinion is strength­ened by the following curious passage from Stephanus deUrbibus,in the article Panos. "There is (fays he) a great statue ofPan, with its private parts raised in a straight direction to thelength of seven singers. The right hand of the statue holdswhips elevated towards the moon, of which luminary they fayPan is an image." c$-» °t w itov ayaXjua piyx, efiiaxot <x*< t«ai^oioy »; iwla $ax\v7.ois. iTalMI Tl /xafi)a; TV ci^tx fftXtjkii r,; niu>.tt

Æschylus was the first that represented these divinitietwith snakes in their hair.~] Those who are of opinion that the Or­phic hymns are spurious compositions, will doubtless imaginethat their opinion is indisputably confirmed by the prtsent pas­sage: for the furies in these hymns* are called opKKrXoxajKoi, orfnaly-haired; and consequently it may be said, they must havebeen written posterior to the time of Æschylus, if what Pausa-nias asserts be true. It must, however, be remembered, that Æs­chylus was accused of inserting in his tragedies things belongingto the mysteriesf; and I (hall produce some very strong argu­ments in the course of these notes, to prove that the Orphichymns which have come down to us, are the very hymns whichwere used in the Eleusinian mysteries. If this be the cafe, eitherPausanias is mistaken in what he asserts of Æschylus iq thisplace; or, which appears to me to be more probable, being a manreb'gioufly fearful of disclosing any particulars belonging to themysteries, he means that no one prior to Æschylus openly repre­sented the Furies with snakes in their hair; or, in other words,that Æschylus was the first prophane writer (as a Christian would

Apollo, to whom the swan is sacred; and consequently this birdplainly signified Plato in the dream of Socrates. Olympiodorustoo, in his Life of Plato, informs us, that when that philosopherwas near his death, he dreamt that he was changed into a (wan,and that, by flying from tree to tree, he gave much trouble to thefowlers in catching him: and this dream, fays he, according to theSocratic Simmias, signified that his meaning would not be appre­hended by his interpreters. For interpreters are similar to fowlers,by attempting to explain the conceptions of the ancients: andPlato's meaning cannot be apprehended, because his discourses,like those of Homer, may be understood physically, ethically,theologically, and in short multifariously. For the souls of Homerand Plato are said to have been produced all-harmonic. Let ithowever be remembered, that though Plato's meaning was byno means apprehended by his more ancient interpreters, yet it is'most divinely and fully unfolded by the latter Platonists, amongwhom Olympiodorus holds a very distinguished place.
Page 91. Jipolh changed him into the bird whose name he boreS\Nothing more appears to be signisiedby this fable, than that Cyc-nus was a man wholly given to external harmony, and who there­fore knew nothing of philosophy, which is the greatest music, asPlato in the Phædo beautifully observes. In consequence there­fore of this neglect of his foul he became united with the life ofa swan, as the punishment of his guilt. But observe, that whenthe rational soul is said to be changed into a brute, the meaning is,that the foul becomes bound to the life of a brute in the fame man­ner as otirpresiding dæmons are united with our fouls: for the hu­man foul never becomes the animating part of a brute, any moiethan dæmons become human fouls. I only add, that the doctrine oftransmigration when viewed in this light is extremely beautiful:and Syrianus and Proclus were, I believe, the first by whom it wasthus explained.

Pentheus the son of Echion waspowerful both through the dignity of his origin, and thefriendship of the king; but as he was an insolent and im­pious man, he was punished by Bacchus for his impiousbehaviour towards him. Labdacus was the son of Poly­dore j and Polydore on his death-bed delivered up Lab­dacus and his kingdom to Nycteus. Other particularsbelonging to this affair I have related in my descriptionpf Sicyoniaj I mean, after what manner Nycteus died,and how the guardianship of his son was committed toLycus the brother of Nycteus,- and all the power of theThebans.
Lycus indeed delivered up the reins of government toLabdacus when he was of age; but Labdacus dying notJong after this, Lycus took Laius the son of Labdacus;into his protection. And while he was again acting thepart of a guardian, Amphion and Zethus collecting toge­ther an army, invaded the country; and those who werecareful lest the race of Cadmus should become extinct, se­cretly conveyed Laius away. The sons of Antiope, however,vanquished Lycus in battle, and taking possession of thekingdom, joined the lower city with Cadmea, and calledthe whole Thebes, on account of their alliance with thenymph Thebe, the daughter of Prometheus. Homer, inthe following verses in the Odyssey, confirms the truthof this account:

CHAP. XXXIII.
But another road from Tithoraca leads to Ledon.This was formerly reckoned a city; but at present the Le-dontii have abandoned it, through the imbecility of theiraffairs, and about eighty of them reside near the Cephis-sus. However, the place of their residence is called Le­don; and they form a part of the Phocenfian convention,just the fame as the Panopenses. But from the placewhich is now inhabited near the Cephissus, to the ruinsof the former city, there is a distance of forty stadia.They fay that the city was denominated from one of itsnatives. Other cities too, besides this, have been irre­parably injured, through the unjust conduct of their in­habitants. Thus Troy was entirely destroyed throughthe base behaviour of Paris towards Menelaus. Thus theMilesians, through the intemperate desire of and lawlesslove of Hestiæus, lost their city, while he was at one timewilling to reign in the city of Edonis, at another time tobe the counsellor of Darius, and sometimes to return toIonia. And thus the Lcdentii severely suffered throughthe sacrilegious conduct of Philomelus. But Lilæa isdistant from Delphos about one winter-day's journey; andyou descend to it through Parnassus. I conjecture thatthe distance is about one hundred and eighty stadia. Asecond unfortunate circumstance from Macedonia op­pressed this city after it was restored: for, being besiegedby Demetrius, the inhabitants were obliged to accede toconditions of peace, and to admit a guard belonging tothe enemy within their walls. Nor were they freed fromthis bondage, till one of the natives, whose name was

And here It may not be improper to observe as a circumstancetruly admirable, that Orpheus, Homer, Plato, and the Chal- ,dæan oracles, have unanimously characterized Jupiter by theduad. Thus both Orpheus and Plato call hifo by a two-foldname Jia and the former signifying that he is the cause
through which things subsist; and the latter his vivific power: forhe is the first cause of vivification. Plato too, in the Parmc-nidet, characterizes him by the dialectic epithets.yslmfn^// and dif­ference. Homer places two urns by his throne. And he is calledby the Chaldscan oracles in leuirnt, twice leyond. The twofaces of Janus, therefore, as he is the fame with the Jupiter ofthe Greeks, admirably correspond with the dual characteristicassigned to that divinity by the most ancient theologists.
I add, that the reader must not be disturbed on finding thatJupiter is called a demon, at this epithet is only given to himin the way of analogy. For, as it is the employment of essentialdæmons to attend on the gods, and proximately preside overinferior natures; so each subordinate order of gods, from fol­lowing the operations of its proximate superior order, and pre­siding over subject natures, may be called analogically, dæ-moniacul with respect to that order. It is in this fenseof the word that Plato, in the Timæus, calls the sublunarygods dtmnns in one place, aud in anothergods of gnds; and thatin the Banquet, he calls Love a mighty dæmon, and in the Phce-drus a god. But not only gods were called dæmons by ancienttheologists, but intellects, foul;;, dæmons, and even men werecalled gods by them. Each, however, was thus denominated ina different respect. For inlelleSs were called gods according tounion ; fouls, according to participation i demons, according to cen­tal}; and men, according to similitude; while, in the mean time,such as are properly gods were assigned this appellation essentially.The observation of these diltiiittions will enable the philosophicreader to solve many apparent inconsistencies in the writings ofancient theologists, and convince him that the ancients believed

i86 THE DESCRIPTION


CHAP. XXX.
AfTER these Polygnotus has painted the daughters ofPandarus. Homer, in the speeches of Penelope, fays, thatthrough the anger of the gods, their parents died whilethey were virgins, and that thus becoming orphans theywere educated by Venus. That they likewise received otherbenefits from other goddesses; as for instance, sufficientprudence and beauty of form from Juno, tallness fromDiana, and such works as arc adapted to the female sexfrom Minerva. Lastly, that Venus ascended to heaven,and obtained from Jupiter prosperous nuptials for the vir­gins; but that during the absence of Van us they wereseized hy the harpies, and delivered up to the Furies.And such is the account given of them by Homer. ButPolygnotus has crowned them with flowers, and has re­presented them playing with dice. The names of thesewomen were Camiro and Clytie.

nated. There is a report too among the vulgar, that acertain inhabitant of this place was pierced with the ar­rows of Apollo, and that on this account the city was calledPytho, because at that time things which putrefied weresaid p'uthejlhaiy which means to become rotten. Hence Ho­mer fays, that the island of the Sirens was full of bones,because men that heard their song, eputhotito, i. e. becamerotten. "With respect to the animal that was slain byApollo, the poets fay it was a dragon, to whom Earth hadcommitted the custody of the oracle. It is also said thatCrius, when he reigned in Euboea, had a son of a very in­solent disposition, who plundered the temple of Apollo,and the dwellings of the rich. But when he was aboutto plunder them a second time with a band of robbers,the Delphi fuppliantly implored Apollo to preserve themfrom the impending danger: and Phemonoe, who was atthat time the prophetess, answered them in hexameterverses to this effect : " In a short time Phoebus will piercewith his arrows a man, the destroyer of Parnassus : but theCretans shall purify their hands from the slaughter, and,the fame of die dead shall never perish."


CHAP. VII.
It appears, indeed, that the temple in Delphos wasfrom the first often plundered by the sacrilegious. Forafter the Eubocan of whom we have just spoken, the na­tion of the Phlegyans, and Pyrrhus the son of Achilles,plundered it. After these, again it was robbed hy a partof the forces of Xerxes, by the most powerful persons

have fins under their breast and belly, like those of th6dolphin, instead of feet. I have likewise seen theÆthiopian bull, which they call rhinoceros, because ahorn projects from the extremity of its nostril, andanother small one under it: but it has no horns onits head. I have seen too the Pæorian bulls, whose bodiesare rough in every part, but particularly in the breastand chin. But the Indian camtls resemble leopards intheir colour. There is a wild beast called alee, which isof a species between a stag atid a camel. This animal isfound among the Gauls; and is the only wild beast, we areacquainted with, which can neither be hunted nor fore­seen at a distance by the human species: but the dæmondrives these into the Hands of the hunter, while he is en­gaged in pursuing other wild beasts. They fay that itsmells a man at a great distance; and, after smelling him,hides itself in chasms and profound caverns. Hunters,therefore, when they have surrounded plains or mountainthickets with their toils, so as that they are certain ofcatching all the aninials within the circumference oftheir toils, catch among the rest the alee. But if it hap­pens that this animal is not in the part in which theyhave fixed their toils, they are unable to take it by anystratagem whatever.
With respect to that wild beast which Ctesias, in hishistory of the Indians, fays, is called by them martiera,but bj the Greeks androphagos, or the devourer of man, I ampersuaded that it is no other than the tiger. This animal,he fays, has a triple row of teeth in one of its jaws, andstings in the extremity of .its tail, with which it defendsitself when attacked near, and hurls them like arrowsagainst its enemies at a distance.

here ever died in the chasm, except one os the spear-bearers of Demetrius, who would not perform any of theestablished religious ceremonies, and who did not comehither for the purpose of consulting divinity, but that hemight enrich himself by carrying the gold and silver fromthe adytum. It is also said, that his dead body was thrownup by a different avenue, and not through the sacred open­ing.- Other reports are circulated about this man, butthose which I have mentioned appear to me to be themost remarkable. When the person that descended toTrophonius returns, the sacrisicers immediately place himon a throne, which they call the throne of Mnemosyne,and which stands not far from the adytum. Then they askhim what he has either seen or heard, and afterwards de­liver him to certain persons appointed for this purpose,who bring him to the temple of Good Fortune, and theGood Dæmon, while he is yet full of terror, and with­out any knowledge either of himself, or of those that arenear him. Afterwards, however, he recovers the use of hijreason, and laughs just the fame as before. / write this,not from hearsay, but from -what I have seen happen to others,end from -what I experienced myself, -when I consulted themracle of Trophinius.

There is another report, which is not so vene­rable as the former, but which is more probable; and it isthis:—Whatever cattle were driven to the sea, were at­tacked and taken away by Triton, who used likewise toseize all small vessels, till the Tanagrians placed on theshore bowls of wine. For Triton, allured by the smell ofthis, drank it, was overpowered by sleep, and fell head­long from a steep part of the shore. After this a Tana-grian cut off his head with an axe; and this is the reasonwhy his statue is without a head. But they are of opinionthat, because he wa» seen intoxicated, he was slain byBacchus.;

I HAVE seen another Triton among the admirable ett--riofities of the Romans, but which is not so large as thisof the Tanagrians. The form of the Tritons is as fol­lows :—The hair of their head resembles the parsley whichgrows in marshes, both in its colour, and in the perfectsimilitude of one hair to another, so that you cannot dis­tinguish any difference among them. The rest of theirbody is rough, with small scales, and is of the fame hard­ness with the skin of a fish. They have the gills of a fishunder their earsv Their nostrils are those of a man, buttheir teeth are broader than those of the human species,and are the teeth of a wild beast.

tible nature. Now the first of these powers you may call InteUleclual; the second •vivtsic ; the third Paonian, and so on, whichthe ancients, desiring to signify to us by names, have symbolicallydenominated. Henpe, says Olympiodorus in MS. Comment,in Gorgiam, we ought not to be disturbed on hearing suchnames as a Saturnian power, the power Jupiter, and such-like,but explore the things to which they allude. Thus for instance*by a Saturnian power rooted in the first cause, understand a pureintellect : for Kgoto; or Saturn is xogo; i. e. 5 xaSafOf, or, a pureintellect. Hence, fays Olympiodorus, we call those that are pureand virgins, xogai. He adds, On this account poets * fay, thatSaturn devoured his children, and afterwards, again sent theminto the light, because intellect is converted to itself, seeks itself,and is itself sought: but he again refunds them, because intel­lect not only seeks, and procreates, but produces into light audprofits. On this account, too, he is called a/xvXop«Ti{, orinfleSed counsel, because an inflected figure verges to itself.Again, as there is nothing disordered and novel in intellect,they represent Saturn as an old man, and as flow in his motion:and hence it is that astrologers fay, that such as have Saturnwell situated in their nativity are prudent and endued withintellect.
Again, the ancient theologists called life by the name of Ju­piter, to whom they gave a two-fold appellation J** and <r,m,signifying by these names, that he gives life through himself.Farther still they aflert that the Sun is drawn by four horses, andthat he is perpetually young, signifying by this his power, whichis motive of the whole of nature subject to his dominion, hisfourfold conversions, and the vigour of his energies. But theyfay that the Moon is drawn by two bulls : by two, on account ofher increase and diminution; but by bulls, because as these tillthe ground, so the Moon governs all those parts which surroundthe earth-

such a terror in the camp of the Phocenses, that theyhastily collected together their wives, children, and all theproperty they were able either to drive or take away,together with their apparel, gold, silver, and statues of thegods. After this they raised a very large funeral pile, andlest with it thirty men, whom they ordered to cut thethroats of the women and children, burn all the propertythat was collected on the funeral pile, and afterward*either murder each other, or rush on the Theflalian horse,if the Phocenses should happen to be vanquished in theengagement. In consequence of this command, all in­human counsels came to be called by the Greeks, Phodcdesperation.
Immediately after this the Phocenses marched againstthe Thessalians, choosing for the commander of their horseRhoecus Ambryflensis, and of their foot Da'i'phanes theHyampolitan. But he who held the most honourable placeamong the commanders was the Elean prophet Tellias,in whom the Phocenses placed the hopes of their safety.As scon therefore as the engagement began, the Pho­censes recollecting what they had determined respectingtheir wives and children, perceived that their safety wasvery uncertain, and for their fakes engaged in every kindof daring undertaking. The signification too of the en­trails gave them the highest reason to hope-that the godswould be propitious to them. And indeed they obtaineda victory of the most splendid kind; in consequence ofwhich the oracle os Apollo, which was given to the Pho­censes, was understood by all the Creeks. For the privateword was given at the fame time to eacli army: to theTheisalians, Minerva Itonia but to the Phocenses, Phocus,from whom they derived their name. In consequence of

The fame historian acids, that thesecrows tore oft" the spear, the owls, and all that was carvedin the palm-tree in imitation of ripe fruit. Clitodemustoo relates other prodigies, which were sent in order todeter the Athenians from that expedition. 1 he Cyrenæitoo dedicated in Delphos a statue of Battus in a chariot,because he brought them by sea from Thera to Libya.In this chariot the nymph Libyc crowns Battus: and thisoffering was made by the Gnoffian Amphion, the son ofAcestor. When Battus built Cyrene, he is said to haveobtained the following remedy for his defect of speech.As the Cyrena:ans were travelling through Africa, andwere yet in the deserts situated in its extremities, Battusbeheld a lion, and through the terror which the sight ofthe beast produced in him, he was compelled to cry outwith a clear and loud voice. Not far from the statue ofBattus there is another statue of Apollo, which was dedi-rcated by the Amphictyons out of the money which thePhpcenses were fined for their impiety to Apollo.

they had plundered the houses- and temples, and had setthe city Callion on fire, returned the same way as theycame to their own people; and the Patrenses alone of allthe Achaians, that assisted the Ætolians, opposed the Bar­barians with their armed forces, in the use of which theywere very skilful. However, they were greatly oppressed,both by the multitude of the Gauls, and despair of success.But then theÆtolians both men and women,placing them­selves in every part of the road, pierced the Gauls withtheir darts, which it was no difficult matter to accomplish,because the Barbarians had no other defence than that oftheir thurioi. At the fame time they easily avoided theGauls when they were pursued by them, and, when theGauls abandoned the pursuit, again eagerly attacked them.Indeed, the Callienses, though the injuries which they sus­tained from the Gauls were so great, that what Homerasserts of the Læstrygons and Cyclops ought not to bereckoned fabulous, were at the fame time justly revengedon their enemies. For out of that great multitude of Gauls,which amounted to forty thousand eight hundred men,scarcely the half escaped to the camps at Thermopylæ.
But the transactions of the Greeks at Thermopylæ atthe fame time w^re as follow: There are two pathsthrough the mountain Oeta : one of these, which is aboveTrachis, is very craggy and steep ; but the other, which isthrough Ænianæ, may be easily passed by foot soldiers.It was through this that the Mede Hydarncs once led hisforces, and came behind the Greeks that were commandedby Leonidas. They understood that the Heracleotæ andÆnianæ were leading Brennus through this path, notfrom any malevolence to the Greeks, but in consequenceof being convinced that it would be a great undertaking,

Bœotia borders on the Athenians, and the rest ofthe Attic land: and the Platæenses are near the Eleuthe-renses. But the whole ;uAijon .of the-Bœotians derived itsname from Bœotus, who they fay was the son of Itonus,and the nymph Melanippe. They add, that Itonus wasthe son of Amphictyon. Many of their towns too are de­nominated from men; but i stuhgreaser number fromwomen. The Platæenses indeed were, as it appears tome, natives of Bœotia from the first; but they are ofopinion that they derived their name from Platæa, thedaughter of a river. It is, however, evident that thePlatæenses reigned here in ancient times. For all Greeceformerly was in subjection to royal authority, and therewas no such thing as a democracy to be found amongthem.

different circulations of the heavens: and that this theory solvesat once all that appears so absurd to persons ignorant of truephilosophy in many of the relations of ancient historians: I mean,the accounts they g^ve of animals which no where exist at pre­sent; and their ascribing properties to such animals as now exist,so different from what they are now found to possess. For itevidently follows, that in fertile periods animals must exist whichare unknown to barren periods; and that all the tribes of ani­mals must upon the whole be superior in every respect: just as infertile ground, and in fertile seasons, the produce is more abun­dant, the species of production are more various, and theitqualities superior to what are found in the produce of barrenground, in the barren seasons of the year.
But the following account of human bones of prodigious mag­nitude which have been discovered, will I doubt not be accept­able to the reader, in addition to the histories of this kind givenby Paufanias. The author of this account is Phlegon Trallianus;and it is taken from his little treatise, On admirable things; andOn those that have lived to a great age. "Not many years since,in Messene, Apollonius fays, that a large stone vessel was brokethrough violent tempests, and a great inundation of water, andthat a head was washed out of it, three times as large as that ofa man, with two rows of teeth. An inscription informed thosethat were endeavouring to find whose head it was, that itwas the head of Idas: for this was the inscription, lAEsl,i. e. OF IDAS. The Messenians, therefore, at the public costprovided another vessel, and placed in it the remains of the heroin such a manner, that they were more secure than before, aithey perceived that this was the person of whom Homer*lays:
Idas the strongest of the mortal race
That flourish'd then, who for a beauteous nymph
Dar'd with Apollo Phoebus to contend,
And aim his arrows at the radiant king.

Brennus andAcichorus led those that marched into Pannonia: andSoigius was the commander of those that attacked theMacedonians and Illyrians. This Bolgius fought againstPtolemy king of the Macedonians, who flew by stratagemSeleucus the son of Antiochus, whose protection at thefame time he suppliantly implored, and who from his pro­digious audacity was called Thunder. Ptolemy howeverfell in this engagement, and together with him no smallpart of the Macedonians. But as the Gauls at that timehad not the boldness to proceed any farther into Greece,they shortly aster returned into their own dominions.
Brennus after this earnestly solicited the general assem­blies of the Gauls, and the principal persons of the Gallicnation, to war upon the Greeks, who, he said, were in­ferior to them in courage, and at that time in an imbeeiicondition. He likewise reminded them of the great wealthwhich-the Greeks had arnaCed, of the numerous oiferingsin their temples, and of their gold and silver ornaments.By this means he persuaded the Gauls to attack theGreeks, and joined to himself both other principal per­sons of that nation, and Acichorus. The Gallic army,in this third expedition, consisted of one hundred andfifty-two thousand foot and twenty thousand sour hun­dred horse: and both horse and foot consisted of valiantsoldiers. However, the true number of these forces wassixty-one thousand two hundred. For two servants fol­lowed each horseman, who were themselves good soldiers,and rode on horseback. These, when their masters werein the midst of an engagement, stood in the rear of thearmy, and if their masters happened to lose their horses

Hence, as in generation, or the sublunaryregion, wholes remain perpetually according to nature, bnt theirparts are sometimes according and sometimes contrary to nature,this mull be true of the parts of the earth. When those circu­lations therefore take place, during which the parts of the earthsubsist according to nature, and this is accompanied with a con­currence of proper instruments aud places, then divine illu­mination is abundantly and properly received. But when theparts of the earth subsist contrary to nature, as at present, andwhich has been the cafe ever since the oracles ceased, then, asthere is no longer an aptitude of places, instruments and times,divine influence can no longer be received, though the illumi­nations of divine natures continue immutably the fame; just,fays Proclus, as if a face standing in the fame position, a mirrorshould at one time receive a clear image of it, and at another,one obscure and debile, or indeed no image at all. For, as thefame incomparable man farther observes, it is no more properto refe.r the defect of divine inspiration to the gods, than toaccuse the sun as the cause os the moon being eclipsed, insteadof the conical shadow of the earth into which the moon falls.

Page 117. The twelve gods, as they are called.] These twelvedivinities are, Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan, Vesta, Minerva, Mars,Ceres, Juno, Diana, Mercury, Venus, Apollo. The first triadof these gods is demiurgic; the second, defensive; the third, vi-vific; and the fourth, elevating and harmonic. These divinitiesaccording to their first subsistence, considered as characterized bythe number twelve, form that order of gods which is called ar»-?.vrof, or liberated, by the Chaldæan theologists, but uir;foip«Miof,y«-percelejlial, by the Greeks, because it is immediately situated abovethe mundane gods. But these gods are received from the libe­rated order into the world. Hence, as Sallust observes in his.elegant little work, On the Gods and the World*: "Of thesegods, some are the causes of the world's existence; othersanimate the world; others again harmonize it, thus composedfrom different natures; and others lastly guard and preserve itwhen harmonically arranged." He adds: "The truth of thismay be seen in statues as in ænigmas. For Apollo harmonizes thelyre, Pallas is invested with arms, and Venus is naked; sinceharmony generates beauty, and beauty is not concealed in objectsof sensible inspection. But since these gods primarily possess theworld, it is necessary to consider the other gods as subsisting inthese; as Bacchus in Jupiter, Æsculapius in Apollo, and theGraces in Venus. We may likewise behold the orbs with whichthey are connected; viz. Vesta with earth, Neptune with water,Juno with air, and Vulcan with fire. But the six superipr godswe denominate from general custom ; for we assume Apollo andDiana for the fun and moon; but we attribute the orb of Satur nto Ceres, sether to Pallas; and we assert that heaven is commonto them all."

Thus far Proclus. But the first: subsistence of the goddesrNight is at the summit of that divine order, which is called bythe Chaldæan theologists mfa kJ WEpoj, intelligible and at the sametune intelleSual. She is besides the mother of the gods, who arenourished with intelligible food from the contemplation of herdivinity: and on this account (he is called the nurse of thegods. Proclus therefore, in the above passages, speaks of Nightaccording to this her first subsistence: but in the passage beforeus of Pausanias, we must consider this goddess according to hermundane subsistence. I only add, that the Chaldæan doctrineof other purer worlds above the inerratic sphere seems, from theOrphic verses just; cited, to have been known to and embraced byOrpheus. For the Chaldæan theologists, as I have proved in myNotes on the Cratylus of Plato, believed, that there were sevencorporeal worlds: one empyrean, three ethereal, and three ma­terial; which last three consist of the inerratic sphere, the planet­ary spheres, and the sublunary region. And in one of the abovecited Orphic verses, Jupiter is ordered to receive all things in­closed in æther; plainly indicating that there is something ethe­real beyond the sensible heavens.

Snd eternal generation of Ceres. For, at the seme tfme that theyfend forth their young into the light, they extend to them milknaturally produced, as their food."
Page 96. And when the Atheniamsenquired of the oracle, &C.2, There are very few, I fear, of the present day, who do not con­sider the oracles of the ancients as mere delusions; and who donot ascribe the accomplishment of their predictions, either to thetricks of designing priesti, or the random power of chance.This, however, must necessarily be the cafe at a period when di­vine influence is totally withdrawn, and delusion and perfectatheism are the substitutes for the genuine religion of mankind.While men indeed are ignorant that true theology (and suchwas that of the ancients) is perfectly scientific, being founded onthe clearest and most natural conceptions of the human mind; andwhile in consequence of this ignorance they believe nothing to bereal, but objects of fense, the doctrine of a communication be­tween men and divine natures must appear ridiculous in the ex­treme. And yet one should think, that history must convincethe most incredulous, that the" numerous instances in which thepredictions of, oracles have been so wonderfully accomplished.Could not be the result either of chance or intrigue. Indeed, hewho can read the many instances of this- kind adduced by Pau-sanias, and yet deny the possibility of man communicating withhigher powers, must either be an atheist or a fool.
For the fake therefore of the lover of divinity, I shall sum­marily disclose the scientific theory of oracles, according to the.philosophy of Plato. As there is not one father of the universeonly, one providence, and one divine law, but many fatherssubordinate to the one first father, many administrators of pro­vidence posterior to, and comprehended in the one universal pro­vidence of the demiurgus of all things, and many laws proceed­ing from one first law, it is necessary that there should be dif­ferent allotments, aad a diversity of divine distribution. Hencetfcere are allotments of partial fouls, such as ours, of unpolluted

A. STONE elevates itself above this place, on whichthe Sibyl Herophile (as the Delphi fay) used to sing heroracles. I have found that this Sibyl was thus denomi­nated from the first in the fame manner as any otherancient Sibyl. The Greeks fay that she was the daughterof Jupiter and Lamia; that Lamia was the daughter ofNeptune; and that (he was the first woman that fangoracles, and was denominated by the Africans Sibylla.This Sibyl Herophile, indeed, was certainly posteriorto Lamia j but at the fame time it appears, that sheflourished prior to the Trojan war. For she predicted,that Helen would be educated in Sparta, that she wouldbe the destruction of Asia and Europe, and that Troythrough her means would be taken by the Greeks. TheDelians make mention of her hymns to Apollo: and inher verses she not only calls herself Herophile, but like­wise Diana. She likewise asserts of herself, that she is thewife of Apollo; and besides this, that she is his sister anddaughter. But these assertions are the result of her beingagitated with fury, and, possessed by the god. In anotherpart too of her oracles, she fays, that she was born from animmortal mother, viz. one of the nymphs of mount Ida,and a mortal father: for thus (lie speaks concerningherself:
"From an immortal nymph, and whale-fed sire,A mean between the two, I sprung to light,From one of Ida's nymphs Ijegot; my native landIs red Marpcssus where Aidoneus stows,A country (acred to the mighty Op«."

Are believed to be brothers."] Sleep and Death werewith great propriety said by the ancients to be twins, from theintimate alliance between Sense and Phantasy, from which we areliberated by these divinities. For as Sleep frees us from the senses,so Death from the phantasy. But Sltep, considered as a godjis that power through which the divinities are enabled to ener­gize in a manner separate from all inferior concerns, at the fametime that their providential care is extended to every part of theuniverse : and this latter energy was denominated by ancient the-ologists vigilance. I only add, that the passage of Homer alludedto by Pausaniasis Iliad 16. v. 672, and that Sleep and Death arecalled brothers both by Orpheus and Hcsiod.
Page 308. Chiron.'] Chiron, according to fables, was the sonof Saturn by the nymph Philyra the daughter of Ocean. Andit is said that Saturn, in order to elude Rhea, changed himselfinto a horse when he was connected with Philyra. Hence theupper parts of Chiron, as far as to his navel, were those of a man,and his lower parts were those of a horse. Chiron, therefore, isthe image of a man, who lived in the confines of the kingdom ofJupiter and Saturn, or, in other words, who lived a life partly•consisting of the political and partly of the intellectual virtues,but yet so that he possessed the former in greater perfection thanthe latter. For the fable, by asserting that his upper parts werehuman, signifies his living according to the politic virtues, of whichJupiter is the exemplar j since Jupiter is peculiarly ir*T»; a>Jja»nSiarc-i, the father of gods and men. As Jupiter therefore is emi­nently a political god, man must partake in an eminent degree of apolitical life. But the lower parts of Chiron evidently partakeof the nature of Saturn: and Saturn is the source of an intel-leSual life, which he causes to receive the most extreme division.But what are we to understand by Saturn changing himself into

by Vulcan. Above the city Chxronea there is a preci­pice, which is called Petrachos. They are of opinionthat Saturn was in this place deceived by Rhea, when heswallowed a stone, instead of Jupiter. On the summit ofthe mountain there is a small statue of Jupiter. In thispart of Chæronea the inhabitants make an ointment, byboiling together roses, lilies, narcissuses, and the herb iris,orszvord-grass : and this is a remedy against pain. If, in­deed, you anoint wooden statues with the ointment ofroses, you will preserve them from rottenness. The irisgrows in marshy places, and is equal in size to the lily;but its colour is not white, and it does not emit so strongan odour as the lily.

cated by Harmonia. These were made front the beak»of the ships of Cadmus. One of these they call CtlejlialVenus, the second Popular, and the third Apojlrophia.
Harmonia gave these names to Venus; the epithet Ce­lestial, signifying pure love, and that which is liberatedfrom the desire of body; the epithet Popular, alluding tovenereal congress; and Apojlrophia, signifying that thisgoddess turns the race of men from unlawful desire andimpious coition. For Harmonia knew, that many impiousactions both among the Barbarians and Greeks were com­mitted through intemperate desire; such as afterwards werecelebrated in verse, of the mother of Adonis, of Phædra .the daughter of Minos, and of the Thracian Tereus. Butthey fay that' the temple of Ceres Thesmophoros wasonce the house of Cadmus and his posterity. The statueof Ceres in this temple is only apparent as far as to thebreast. Brazen shields are fixed in this place, which theyfay belonged to the Lacedæmonian noblemen that fell inthe b.-rtle at Leuctrai Near the gates called Proetæ thereis a theatre: and very near the theatre there is a templeof Lysian Bacchus. For u lien formerly the Thracians ledaway many captives from the Thebans, Bacchus freedthem from their bond:-, when they came near the bordersof the Haliartians, and enabled them to slay the Thra­cians when oppress with sleep. 1 he Thebans, too, faythat the other statue which is in this temple is the statueof f-emele. Once every year, on stated days, they openthis temple. Here likewise there are ruins of the houseof Lycus, and a sepulchre of Semele; for it is not thesepulchre of Alcmene; as, according to report, she waschanged after her death into a stone. For the Thebans• do not give the fame account of her as the Megarenses.

Amongthe Pergamenians too, in the bed-chamber of Attalus, andin the temple which they call Puthion, there are Graceswhich were painted by the Parian Pythagoras. Besidesall these, Socrates the son of Sophroniscus made a sta­tue os the Graces for the Athenians, which is placedin the vestibule of their tower. These are all in a similarmanner clothed: and I cannot tell for what reason menin aster times, in their statues and pictures of the Graces,represented them naked.

On the death of Eteocles, the kingdom came to theposterity of Halmus. The daughters of this Halmus wereChrysogenea and Chryse. It is reported, thr.t Phlegyas wasthe son of Mars by Chryse. And Phlegyas reigned afterEteocles, because Eteocles did not leave any male offspringbehind him. But at that time the name of the wholecountry was changed; so that the region whkh was be­fore denominated Andreis, was then called Phlegyantis.The city too Andreis was inhabited from the first, towhich Phlegyas added another called by his own name,and collected into it the best of all the Grecian warriors.The Phlegyans, however, in after times, through theirstupidity and boldness, separated themselves from the otherOrchomenians, and led away at the fame time the neigh­bouring people.

Kim, that she alone of all the divinities Was not celebratedby him in his hymns, but that when he came to her, hewould compose a hymn in her praise. And indeed hedied on the tenth day aster this dream. But there was atThebes a certain old woman allied to Pindar, and whowas very conversant with his verses, which she used to sing.To her Pindar appeared in a dream, and sang a hymn toProserpine: and the old woman, as soon as she was awake,committed to writing all that she had heard Pindar sing­ing in her sleep. In this hymn, among other appellationsof Pluto, he is called Chrusinios, or possessing golden reins:and it is evident that this epithet pertains to the rape ofProserpine.
From the sepulchre of Pindar, there is a road which i3for the most part plain to Acræphnium. They fay thatthis city was at first a part of the Theban land: and Ihave found that Theban exiles afterwards fled hither, whenAlexander subverted Thebes. For these, through imbeci­lity and old age, not being able to reach the Attic land, tookup their residence in this place. This little city is situatedin the mountain Ptous; and contains a temple and statueof Bacchus, which deserve to be inspected. On proceed­ing to about the distance of fifteen stadia from this city,you will fee on the right hand a temple of Apollo Ptous.But Ptous was the son of Athamas and Themrstus; andfrom him both Apollo and the mountain were denomi­nated, according to the poet Asius. Before Thebes wasdestroyed by Alexander, there was an oracle in this tem­ple, which was by no means fallacious. They fay thatan European, whose name was Mys, was once sent hitherby Mardonius, for the purpose of consulting the oracle;and that the god answered his interrogations, not in the

Isis and Osiris. Proclus too in Tim. pu 3*. fays that according tothe Æ-yptian historians, there was the following inscription oilthe statue of Minerva, in the adytum of the temple: tym nfu miTo TtyoKif, Kj ot, k) mfun)' k| rot tfjuit ?rtirV.v ot-^iic »» flnjxo; arixa-o» xatfiroi itucc* n'.ior t^!»iTo. i. e. " I am every thing
THAT HAS BEEN, THAT IS, AND THAT SHALL BE; AND NOMORTAL HAS EVER VET BEEN ABLE TO WITHDRAW MY VEIL.THE FRTJIT WHICH I HAVF BROUGHT FORTH IS THE SUN."—
It is remarkable that this inscription, as far as to the first period,is cited by Plutarch in his above-mentioned treatise ; but I knowof no author except Proclua who has cited the latter part, "thefruit which I have brought forth is the fun;" nor has this import­ant addition been noticed by any modern writer that I am ac­quainted with, owing doubtless to the want of a copious index tothese invaluable commentaries ot Proclus.
As Ifis therefore is Minerva, and as the veil of this goddess, asI have observed in a former note, is an emblem of Nature, whichproceeds from those intellectual vital powers contained in the es­sence of Minerva, we may perceive the reason why the Arriians,Æthiopians and Ægyptiaus called Nature (as we are informed byApuleius) Ifis. Likewise since the moon, as we learn from Pro­clus, is the auiWion ayafyia tr,% (fveit*;, the fe/f-i't/ive image of Na­ture, we may fee why Nature was called by the Cretans, accordingto Apuleius in the tame place, Diana. And in short, as Minervawas justly called by the ancients xoji/f n t«» Si»>», the summit of thegods, and is therefore their source in conjunction with her fatherJupittr, we may at one view see the propriety of her being calledby the names of so many other goddesses, in the following sublimepassage from the Metamorphoses of Apuleius : for, as every causeis that primarily which its estect is secondarily, Minerva is in acertain respect the same with all the divinities that proceed iromher, when they arc considered according to their causal subsistencein her essence.

the interment of the slain; a desire of terrifying theirenemies by this specimen of their ferocity; and their wantof commisexation for the dead. In this engagement fortyof the Greeks fell, but the number of the Barbarians thatwere slain cannot be accurately ascertained, because manyof them were swallowed up in the mud.


CHAP. XXII.
On the seventh day after the battle, a part of theGallic army endeavoured to ascend the mountain Oeta,in that part of it which is near Heraclea. But the pathhere was very narrow, beyond which were the ruins ofTrachis; and beyond Trachis there was a temple of Mi­nerva, which contained sacred offerings. The Gauls how­ever hoped they should be able to ascend Oeta throughthis narrow path, and at the fame time plunder the tem­ple of Minerva. That guard, however, which was underthe command of Telefarchus vanquished the Barbarians,though Telesarchus himself sell in the engagement, a manremarkably zealous in the cause of Greece. But. whenthe other commanders of the Barbarians were terrified bythe valour of the Greeks, and began to despair of successin future, as they saw that all their present undertakingswere adverse, Brennus considered that, if he could butforce the Ætolians to return home, he should easily .finishhis war on the Greeks. Having therefore chosen fortythousand soot and eight hundred horse out of his wholearmy, he gave the command of these forces to Orestoriusand Combutis, and ordered them first os all to pass into3 Theffaly

TH respect to the dead bodies in the picture, oneof them is Pelis, who is naked, and is thrown on his fide.Beneath him Eioneus and Admetus lie, having on theircoats of mail. Lescheus informs us, that Eioneus was llainby Neoptolemus, and Admetus by Philoctetes. Abovethese theje are other dead bodies. Under the laver Leo-critus the son of Polydamas lies, who was slain by Ulysses.Above Eioneus and Admetus is Corœbus the son ofMygdon. There is a noble monument of this Mygdonin the borders of the Ectorean Phrygians: and from himpoets denominate the Phrygians, Mygdonians. Corœbuscame to the wedding of Cassandra; and, according togeneral report, was slain by Neoptolemus. Lescheus faysthat he was slain by'Diomed. Above Corœbus are Priam,Axion, and Agenor. Lescheus informs us, that Priam wasnot slain at the altar of Hercean Jupiter, but being draggedfrom the altar was beheaded by Neoptolemus, when hemet him before the doors of the palace. With respect toHecuba, Stesichorus, in his potm on the destruction ofTroy, fays that flie was transported by Apollo to Lycia. ButLescheus fays, that Axion was the son of Priam, and that,he was slain by Eurypylus the son of Eusemon. The famepoet too asserts that Neoptolenlus slew Agenor. Andhence it appears, that Echcclus the sort of Agenor wasslain by Achilles, and Agenor himself by Neoptolemus.Sinon the companion of Ulysses and Anchialus arc car­rying out the dead body of Laomedon.

Olen was the first who prophesied at Delphos, and de­livered oracles in hexameter verses. The following arethe verses of Boeo:
"Here Pagafus, Agyicus the divine,
From th' Hyperboreans, Phœbus, rais'd to thee
A building, for thine oracle renovvn'd.''
And after she has enumerated other Hyperboreans, to­wards the end of the hymn, she mentions Olen:
"Olen, the first who Phœbus' will disclos'd,The first who verses of the ancients fung.''
If we follow tradition, however, women alone were thefirst interpreters of oracles.
They farther report, that the most ancient temple ofApollo was raised from the laurel-tree; and that thebranches from which it was built were cut from that treewhich is at Tempe. The form of this temple resembledthat of a cottage. But the Delphi say, that the othertemple of Apollo was raised by bees from wax and wings,and was sent by Apollo to the Hyperboreans. There is like­wise another report concerning chis affair, that a Delphosman, whose name was Pteras, built this temple, and thatfrom this circumstance the temple came to be called bythe name of its artificer. From this fame Pteras, too, aCretan city, with the addition of one letter, was denomi­nated Apterxi. I cannot, however, be induced to be­lieve that this temple was framed from a herb Pteris, orfern, which grows on mountains, and this while the herbwas yet green.

When therefore hedrew near to Lechæus, and was about to pass throughthe difficult and narrow defiles, Iphicrates the son ofTimotheus met him with troops armed with shields likea half moon, and witk the other forces of the Athenians,which he led against the Thebans.

As it is the province therefore of Mercuryto unfold and fill all things with truth, and truth is the fame withsure simplicity; and as stability osejfcnct is derived from truth, wemay easily perceive the propriety of consecrating a square figureto Mercury. As Hercules too, according to his mundane distri­bution as a god, seems to be the fame with the Sun, according tothe Orphic theology, and Mercury, Venus and Apollo arc deitiesof the fame order, and profoundly united to each other, we can­not wonder that the statues of Hercules should resemble those ofMercury.

The passage in which he employs this argument is asfollows; "It is here requisite to remember the Platonic hypo­theses concerning the earth. For Plato does not measure itsmagnitude after the same manner as mathematicians; but thinks%hat its interval is much greater, as Socrates asserts in the Phaedo,In whieh dialogue also he fays, that there are many habitableparts similar to the places of our abode. And hence he relates,that an island and continent of this kind existed in the externalpr Atlantic sea. For indeed, if the earth be naturally spherical,it is necessary that it should be such according to its greatest part.But the parts which we inhabit, both internally and externally,exhibit great inequality.

But Amphion obtainedhis reputation in music, in consequence of having learntfrom the Lydians, through his alliance to Tantalus, thetydian harmony, and inventing three chords in additionto the four which had been—already discovered. Theauthor, however, of the verses upon Europa fays, thatAmphion first learned the use of the lyre, from Mercury,and that he drew along stones aud wild beasts by his har­mony. But Myron the Byzantian, who wrote heroicverses and elegies, fays, that Amphion was the first thatraised an altar to Mercury j and that for this he receiveda lyre from the god- It is also said that Amphion ispunished in Hades for reviling Latona and her sons. Thispunishment of Amphion is mentioned in the poem calledMinyas, and which is composed in common upon Am­phion and Thamyris.
But after the house of Amphion was destroyed bypestjlence, and Zethus had fallen a victim to grief, in con­sequence of his wife having slain his son for a certainoffence, then the Thebans gave up the government toJ^aius. And Laius, during his reign, married Jocasta..He received too an oracle from Delphos, which told himthat if he had a son by Jocasta, that son would be themean6 of his death. In consequence of this he exposedOedipus as soon as he was born: and Oedipus, as soon ashe arrived at manhood, flew his father, and married his mo­ther. But that Oedipus had no children by his mother, isevident from the following verses of Homer in the Odyssey:

On coming into the city, you will fee temples in a con-rtinued series. The first of these is in a ruinous condition;the second is without statues; the third has images of theRoman emperors, but these are not numerous 5 and thefourth is called the temple of Minerva Pronoia. But ofthe statues which are in the vestibule of this temple, thereis an offering of the Maflilienfes, which is larger than thestatue within the temple. These Maflilienfes are a co­lony of the Phocaenses, and a part of those Ionians, who,in order to avoid Harpagus the Mede, fled from Phoccea.Having, however, vanquiflied the Carthaginians in a navalbattle, they took possession of that country which theynow inhabit, and arrived at a high degree of prosperity.The offering too of the Maflilienfes is brazen. But theDelphi fay, that the golden shield which was dedicatedby Crœsus the Lydian king to Minerva Pronoia, wastaken away by Philomelus. Near this temple of Minervathere is an heroic grove of Phylacus. According to theDelphi, this Phylacus assisted them when they were at­tacked by the Persians.

Carrying with them burning lamps."] The proprietyof employing burning lamps, in a contest sacred to Prometheut,is sufficiently apparent from the account we have already given ofthis divinity. For Prometheus, we have shewn, is the inspec-tive guardian of the descent of rational souls; and fire, from itstending upwards, is an emblem of the rational foul. As a burn­ing lamp therefore may be considered as a very proper image ofour rational part, it appears to me, that this custom adopted bythe Athenians, of running from the altar of Prometheus to thecity with burning lamps, in which he alone was victoiious whoselamp remained unextinguished in the race, was intended to signi­fy that he is the true conqueror in the race of life, whose rationalpart is not extinguished, or, in other words, does not become dor­mant in the career.

On pro­ceeding therefore from Orchomenos to Opus, and turninga little to the left hand, you will fee a road which leadsto Abæ. The inhabitants of this city fay that they cameto Phocis from Argos, and that their city was denominatedirom Abas by whom it was built. They add, that Abaswas the son of Lynceus and Hypermnestra the daughterof Danaus. The Abæans too have venerated Apollo froman early period of time, and once possessed an oracle ofthe god. But the Persians did not pay the fame venera­tion to this divinity as the Romans did afterwards. Forthe Romans, through their piety to Apollo, suffered theAbæans to use their own laws: but the army of Xerxesburnt the temple in Abæ. The Greeks, however, that op­posed the Barbarians, did not think proper to rebuild thetemples of the Greeks which the Persians had burnt, thatthe ruins of them might remain as perpetual monumentsof hatred between the two nations. Hence, in the bordersof the Haliartians, many half-burnt temples yet remain;and among the Athenians in the Phaleric road there is atemple of Juno half burnt, and this is the cafe with atemple of Ceres in Phalerum.

As Pau-sanias therefore was pious, but without philosophy, he could nothave any conception of the concealed philosophical meaning ofHomer in the fable of Ulysses.

success chose Epaminondas for their general, with thefree consent of the Bœotian præfects. Alexander, there­fore, perceiving that the command was transferred toEpaminondas, had not the boldness to come to an engage­ment, and voluntarily dismissed Pclopidas. 'But duringthe absence of Epaminondas, the Thebans drove the Or-chomenians from their country. This violence Epami­nondas bore indignantly, and said that the Thebans wouldhot have dared to act in this manner if he had beenpresent.
In the mean time, as no other Bœotian governor waschosen, Epaminondas led his army again to Peloponnesus,and vanquished the Lacedæmonians near Lechæus; andtogether with them the Pelienenscs from among theAchaians, and of the Athenians, those which had beenled by Chabr'as. It w as an established custom among theThebuns to take a ransom for their prisoners, except suchas were Bœotians •, for these they condemned to death.But Epaminondas having taken a small city of the Sicyo-nians called Fhœbia, and which contained the greatestpanel the Bœotian exiles, enfranchised them on their pay­ing down a certain sum of money ; at the same time call­ing them by the names of unlerent countries, just as theycame into his mind. However, when he came to Man-tinea with his army, and was then victorious, he was(lain by an nthenian: and among the Athenians in apicture of an equestrian battle, a man is represented slay­ing Epaminondas, and the writing under him shews thathe is GrylluS the son of Xenophon.

But in order to understand who the Homeric Circe is, it is ne«cessary to observe, that the ancient theologists, when they repre­sent divine natures, as employed in the exercise of certain arts,means to ininuate by such arts producing, prolific, inttllcBual, andperseQ'vvepowers, which proceed from the gods into the universe;all the parts of which are nothing more than illuminations ofthese powers. This being premised, "Circe (says Proclus inhis Scholia on the Cratylus) is that divine power which weavesall the life contained in the four elements, and at the fame timeby her song harmonizes the whole sublunary world. But theshuttle with which she weaves, is represented by theologists asgolden, because her essence is intellectual, pure, immaterial, andunmingled with generation; all which is signified by the shuttlebeing golden. And her employment consists in separating*things stable from such as are in motion, according to divinediversity." . I only add, that Homer with great propriety re­presents Circe, who presides over the sublunary world, or therealms of geneiation, as waited on by Nymphs sprung fromfountains: for Nympha,tsays Hermias (Comment. MS. in Flat.Phædrum), are goddesses presiding over regeneration, and arethe attendants of Bncchus the son of 'Semele. On this accountthey are present with water; that is, they ascend as it were into,and rule over generation.

And Pindar in one of his odes speaks in con­formity to this opinion. Here too there is an offering ofthe Lacedæmonians, viz. Hermione the daughter of Me-nelaus, who was married to Orestes the son of Aga­memnon, and prior to this to Neoptolemus the son ofAchilles. This was made by Calamis. The Ætolians like­wise dedicated in this temple a statue of Eurydamus, whowas their commander when they fought against the Gauls.In the mountains of Crete the city Elyros yet exists. Thi»city sent a brazen goat to Apollo, which is representedsuckling Phylacis and Phylander. The Elyrians fay, thatthese were the sons of Apollo and the nymph Acacallis;and that Apollo had connection with her in the cityTarrha, and in the house os Carmanor. But the Carystiifrom Eubcea sent a brazen ox to Apollo for havinggained a victory over the Persians.
Both theCarystii and Platxcnfes,indeed,dedicated oxen,as it appears to me, because, having expelled the Barba­rians from Greece, they obtained in other respects a stabledegree of property, and were enabled to cultivate a freeland. The Ætolians dedicated the images of their com­manders, and together with these Apollo and Diana, inconsequence of having conquered their neighbours theAcarnanes.

Above GlICis there is a mountain whichis called Supreme; and in it there is a temple with a statuees Jupiter the Supreme. But the torrent which is in thisplace they call Thennodon. On turning towards Teumef-(us, and into the road which leads to Chalcis, you will sec asepulchre of Chalcodon, who was (lain by. Amphitryon inthe battle between the Thebans and Eubœenses. Afterthis you will perceive the ruins of the cities Harmas and.Mycaleflus. The former of these was thus denominated,according to the Tanagræans, because Amphiaraus disap­peared with his chariot in this place, and not in that menrtioned by the Thebans. But it is acknowledged both by,the Tanagræans and Thebans, that Mycaleflus was socalled, because the ox which was the guide of Cadmusand hre associates, in their journey to Thebes, lowed there.After what manner too Mycaleflus came to be a desolateplace, I have Ihewn in my; account of the Athenianaihnrs.
In that part of Mycaleflus which borders on the sea,there is a temple of MycaleŒan. Ceres. They fay thatthis is opened and shut again every night by Hercules iand'that Hercules is one of those that arc called the Id.eiDactyli. The following wonderful circumstance happenshere: They place before the feet of the statue of Ceres,all the fruit which autumn produces: and this remains en­tire through the whole year.

entering this temple, you will fee a statue of Rhea pre-;senting Saturn with a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes,instead of the child of which she had been delivered. Theycall Juno, Teleia, or the perfect. There is a large statueof the goddess in an upright position: both these sta­tues are made of Pentelican stone, and are the works ofPraxiteles. There is another statue of Juno in a sittingposture in the same temple; and this wa§ made by Cal-limachus. But they call the goddess Numpheuemenc, orespoused, on the following account.
CHAP. III.
TliEY fay, that Juno being angry with Jupiter, on,what account it is not known, retired to Euboea; andJupiter not being able to appease her, came to Cithæron,who then reigned over the Platæenses. This Cithseronwas not second to any one in craft. He therefore per-;suaded Jupiter to make a statue of wood, to phee it veiledin a car drawn by two oxen, and publicly assert that thiswas Flatæa, the daughter of Asopus, whom he was goingto marry. As soon as Juno heard this, she immediatelycame to the car, and, cutting off the veil, perceived thatwhat stie supposed was a new married lady, was nothingmore than a wooden image; and in consequence of this-'became reconciled to Jupiter. In remembrance of thisreconciliation, they celebrate a festival which is calledDædal, because the ancients called wooden statues Dæda­lian. But it appears to me that this name was usurped,before Dædalus the son of Palamaon was born; and thatafterwards, from Dædalian statues Dædalus derived his
name.

a considerable part of the country. The Thebans fay, that!the river Cephissus was turned by Hercules into the Orcho-menian plains; and that prior to this it ran into the sea,under a mountain ; hut that Hercules closed up the chasm.Homer indeed knew of the lake Cephissis, but he doesnot fay that it was the work of Hercules. For thus hespeaks concerning it:
"Inclining o'er the lake Cephiffis"
Nor is it probable, that the chasm was not discovered bythe 'Orchomenians, and that Hercules, by separating it,restored to the river its ancient passage, since even in theTrojan times they were in, no want of money. Thisis evident from what Homer represents Achilles sayingin answer to the ambassadors of Agamemnon:
"Not all the wealth Orchomenus receives."
It is clear from hence, that the Orchomenians were sup­plied with gTeat riches at that time. But, as they fay, As-plcdcn was then deprived of inhabitants through scarcityof water. They add, that the city was denominated fromAspledon, who was the son of Neptune by the nymphMidea. This account is confirmed by the verses whichthey fay were made by Cherfias the Orchomcnian:
"Afpktlen, in an ample city bern,
Fr^m Neptune and th' illustrious Mida sorting."
The verses however of this Cherfias are not now extant iand the above lines ere cited by Calippus in his orationon the Orchomeni.ms. They likewise assert, that theepigram on the sepulchre of HeGod was composed byCherfias.

It is likewise reported of Orpheus, that after thedeath of his wife, he came in consequence of it to Aornusin Thesprotia, because there was an ancient oracle there ofdeparted spirits; that when he came here he expected thefoul of Eurydice would follow him; but that finding him­self disappointed, he flew himself through grief. TheThracians add, that the nightingales, which build theirnests about the sepulchre of Orpheus, sing sweeter andlouder than other nightingales. But the Macedonians,who inhabit die country under the Pierian mountain, andthe city Dibs, fay that Orpheus was slain in that place bywomen. On proceeding from Dios to the mountain atabout the distance of twenty stadia, you will fee a pillaron the right hand, and upon it a stone urn, which, ac­cording to the inhabitants of this place, contains the bonesof Orpheus. The river Helicon flows through this partof the country, and at the distance of eighty-five stadiahides itself in the earth. Afterwards having concealed it­self for about twenty-two stadia, it again rises, and, as­suming the name of Baphyræ instead os Helicon, becomesa navigable river, and pours itself into the sea. The Diatxsay, that this river at first ran in an open channel; but thatwhen the women who flew Orpheus attempted to washthemselves from his blood in it, then it funk into the earth,that its water might not be the means of purifying themfrom his murder.

Amphisla, the daughter of Macareus the son of Æolus,and who was beloved by Apollo.
This city is adorned with many excellent pieces of■workmanship; but the monuments of Amphisla and An-drærnon deserve to be mentioned beyond all the rest. Theysay that Gorge, the wise os Andrxmon, and daughter ofOeneus, is buried here with Andræmon. But in the towerthere is a temple of Minerva; and in it an erect brazenstatue. They say that this statue was brought by Thoasfrom Troy, and that it belonged to the Trojan spoils.This however I cannot believe. For in the former part ofthis work, I have fliewn that the Samians, Rhcecus theson of Philaeus, and Theodorus the son of Telecles, werethe first that found out the art of casting brass. But Ihave not yet been able to find any of the works of Theo­dorus which consist of brass. But in the temple of Ephe-fian Diana, as you approach to that cell which containscertain pictures, you will fee above the altar of Diana, whois called Protothronia, a stone inclosure. Upon this in­closure there are other statues, and an image of a womannear its extremity. This statue was made by Rhcecus;and the Ephesians call it Night. The statue therefore ofMinerva in Amphisla is more ancient in its appearance,and the art displayed in its fabrication is less polilhed.The Amphissenses too celebrate the mysteries of theyouths who are called AnaEles. Of these gods there arcvarious opinions. For, according to some, they are theDioscuri; according to others, the Curetes; and a stillgreater number think that they are the Cabiri.

For his body was covered with lice: and hisformer good fortune was terminated by so calamitous anend. But the temple in Alalcomenæ was neglected afterthis event, as being deprived of its divinity. Another cir­cumstance too happened in my time, which contributedto the dissolution of the temple. A large and strong ivy,which grew by the side of the temple, destroyed the ce­ment of the stones, and separated them from each other.A torrent not very large, which they call Triton, flowshere: and they fay it was thus denominated, because Mi­nerva was educated near the river Triton; just as if thistorrent was the river Triton, and not that which, pro­ceeding from the marsti Tritonis in Africa, pours itselfinto the Lybian sea.

For how could the report of his wickedness be imme­diately abolished, if he had four children byjocasta? Thesechildren indeed were the offspring of Euryganea thedaughter of Hyperphas: and this is evinced by the authorof the verses called Oedipodia. Onasias painted forthe Platæenfes Euryganea, with a sorrowful countenance,on account of t!>e battle between her sens. But Po-lynices, while Oedipus was yet alive and reigned, leftThebes, fearing left the imprecations of his father shouldbe accomplished. In consequence of this he came to Ar-gos, and married the daughter of Adrastus; but after thedeath of Oedipus, returned through the persuasions of hisbrother Eteocles to Thebes. Here, however, a disagree­ment arising between him and his brother, he was againexiled. After this he requested of Adrastus to furnishhim with an army against his brother. This Adrastuscomplied with: but Polynices lost his army, and the twobrothers engaging each other in a single combat, wereboth slain.

stadia from this temple of Æsculapius, there is an inclosure"?and in it there is an adytum sacred to Ifis. This is the mostholy of every thing which the Greeks consecrate to thisgoddess. For the Tithoreans neither think it proper totake up their residence here, nor to suffer any to enter theadytum, except such as the goddess Ifis informs them bya dream she thinks proper to admit. The subterraneangods in the cities above the Mæander act in just the famemanner; for they exhibit in dreams the images of thosepersons who they are willing should be admitted intothe adyta.
But the Tithoreans celebrate the Paneguris of Ifis twicea year, viz. in spring and in autumn. And on the thirdday prior to each of these public solemnities, those thatare permitted to enter the adytum purify it after a certainsecret manner; and always bring into the fame place therelics of the victims which were sacrificed in the formersolemnity, and bury them there. This place where theybury the relics, is, as far as I can conjecture, about twostadia distant from the adytum. And these are the cere­monies which they perform on that day. On the follow­ing day they erect pedlars tents from reeds and othermaterials which they happen to meet with. And on thelast of the three days, those who assemble in these tentsfell slaves, and cattle of every kind, together with appa­rel, silver, and gold. After the middle of the day, too,they turn their attention to the sacrifice. And then themore affluent sacrifice oxen and stags; but the poorerfort geese, and the birds called Meleagrides. But theydo not think proper to sacrifice swine; nor do they em­ploy on this occasion sheep or goats. Such victims asthey sacrifice they send into the adytum, where a funeral

had continued to (hine for about 1550 years. The historian,Pancirollus, who mentions this lamp, is a respectable author, andrelates it as a well-known fact, in his curious book, entitled, Con­cerning memorable Things known to the Antients, but now-lost.
Saint Austin too (De Civitat. Dei, I.21. cap. 6.) fays, thata lamp was found in a temple dedicated to Venus, which wasalways exposed to the open weather, and could never be con­sumed, or extinguished. And Ludovicua Vives, his commen­tator, mentions another lamp, which was found a little before histime, that had continued burning for 1050 years.
A very remarkable lamp was discovered about the year 1500,near Atestes, a town belonging to Padua in Italy, by a rustic,who digging deeper than usual, sound an earthen urn, contain­ing another urn, in which last was a lamp placed between twocylindrical vessels, one of gold, and the other of silver, and eachof which was full of a very pure liquor, by whose virtue, it isprobable, the lamp had continued to (hine for upwards of 1500years; and, unless it had been exposed to the air, might havecontinued its wonderful light for a still greater period of time.This curious lamp was the workmanship of one Maximus Oly-bius, who most probably effected this wonder by a profoundskill in the chymical art. On the greater urn some verses wereinscribed in Latin, which may be translated as follows:

At that time Theophilus was the Athenianarchon, and it was the first year of the one hundred andeighth Olympiad, in which the Cyrenæan Polycles wasvictor in the stadium. The following Phociean citieswere then taken, and levelled with the ground, viz. Lilaea,Hyampolis, Anticyra, Parapotamii, Panopeus, and Daulis.The names of these cities were renowned in former times,and afe celebrated in no small degree in the poems ofHomer. But the Phocæan cities Erochus, Charadra,Amphiclea, Neon,Tethronium, and Drymæa, which wereburnt by the army of Xerxes, became through this cir­cumstance more known to the Greeks. All the othercities except Elatea were obscure prior to this war, viz.the Phocic Thracis, Medeon, Phocicus, Echedamia, Ara-brysus, Ledon, Phlygonium, and Sterrhis. All these citieswhich we have enumerated were then destroyed, and, ex­cept Abas, were reduced to the form of villages. For theAbæans were free from the impiety of the other cities,and had neither plundered the temple of Apollo, nor en­gaged in the war. The Phoccnses too are forbidden theuse of the Delphic temple, are not admitted as membersof the general assembly of the Greeks, aud the Amphic-tyons have taken from them the privilege of voting, andtransferred it to the Macedonians. Some time after thisthe Phocrean cities were rebuilt, and the Phocenses rc-i turned.

Page 41. Near this is the temple of Celejlial Venus,,] The Celes­tial Venus (for there are two Venufes, as is well known) is thatdivine power which collects together the different genera ofthings, according to one desire of beauty. She is therefore veryproperly said to derive her subsistence from the prolific power ofHeaven: for Heaven, as I have (hewn in my notes on the Craty-lus, composes that order of gods which is called by the ChaldseartTheologists rouTo; voijoc, i. e. intelligible and at the fame timcintcl-leftual; which corresponds to intelligence; and is wholly of acontaining and conn :8ive nature. "But the second Venus, faysProclus (in Schol. MSS. in Cratylum), Jupiter produces from,his own generative powers, in conjunction with Dione: and thisgoddess likewise proceeds from foam, after the fame mannerwith the more ancient Venus, as Orpheus evinces. But thesegoddesses differ from each other, according to the causes of theirproduction, their orders and their powers. For she that pro­ceeds from the genitals of Heaven is supermundane, leads up­wards to intelligible beauty, is the supplier of an unpolluted'life, and separates from generation. But the Venus that pro­ceeds from Dione governs all the co-ordinations in the celestialworld and the earth, binds them to each other, and perfects theirgenerative progressions, through a kindred conjunction. These .divinities too are united with each other, through a similitude ofsubsistence: for they both proceed from generative powers; onefrom that of the containing power of Heaven, and the otherfrom that of Jupiter the artificer of the world." He adds,"that by the sea we must understand an expanded and circum­scribed life; by its profundity, the universally-extended progres­sion of such a life; and by the foam, the greatest purity ofnatute, that which is full of prolific light and power, that whichswims upon all life, and is as it were its highest flower."

tinually suspended from its proper principle, pervades throughevery order. But the golden throne which Vulcan fends toJuno, is that vehicle depending on the goddess, and from illu­minating which she has a mundane establishment: and the un-apparent bonds which it contains are those -vital connectives bywhich foul becomes united with body. These bonds are said t»be fixed in the throne by Vulcan, because this deity is superiorto Juno, considered according to her mundane establishment. Allthe gods except Bacchus were unable to persuade Vulcan to freeJuno from her bonds; because Bacchus, or the mundane intellect,is the monad or proximately exempt producing cause of theultimate progressions of all the gods; and hence Vulcan, consi­dered according to his last procession, is suspended from Bacchus,by whom at the fame time he is converted on high. HenceBacchus is said to have led him back to heaven: but it is added,by means of intoxication; i. e. by deific intelligence, throughwhich every inferior deity is converted to deities of a superiorcharacteristic, and all the gods become absorbed in the ineffableprinciple of all things. Lastly, by Vulcan freeing Juno from herbonds, nothing more is meant than, that this goddess accordingto her mundane establishment receives a power from Vulcan,through which while (he illuminates with a divine light her de­pending vehicle, flic is at the fame time exempt from all inclinationand passive affection towards the subject of her illuminations: andthe fame reasoning must be applied to every mundane divinity.

Lescheus relates in his verses, that when Troy wastaken, Æthra escaped, and came to the camps of theGreeks; that she was there known by the sons of Theseus,and that Demophon requested her in marriage 9s Aga­memnon. That he indeed was willing to gratify Demophon,but that he said he would not accomplish their desires, tillhe had gained the consent of Helen. A herald thereforebeing sent to Helen, found her disposed to the match.Hence, in the picture, Eurybates appears addressing Helenon account of Æthra, and delivering to her the messageof Agamemnon. Trojan women too are represented inthis picture in the habit of mourning captives. The firstof these is Andromache with an infant at her breast.Lescheus fays, that this infant was thrown from a tower,not indeed by the decree of the Greeks, but through theprivate hatred of Neoptolemus, who ordered him to beput to death. Medesicaste likewise is painted here, whowas one of the bastard daughters of Priam, who, accord­ing to Homer, dwelt in the city Pedæum, and was mar­ried to Imbrius the son of Mentor. Andromache andMedesicaste are veiled: but Polyxena is painted with herhair platted after the manner of virgins. Poets sing, andthe pictures which I have seen at Athens, and Pergamuswhich is a city above Cakus, in which die calamities ofPolyxena are painted, evince, that she was slain at thetomb of Achilles. Polygnotus too has painted in thefame picture, Nestor with a hat on his he.id, and a spearin his hand. A 'horse rolling in the dust is seen nearhim. The ground on which the horse lies is the sea shore jand the pebbles on the sliore are represented. The re­maining part of the ground does not appear to resemblethe sea shore. ,

the nature of the phantasy. In order to be convinced of which,it is neceflary to observe, that the rational soul, or the true man,consists of intellect, cogitation (Jiawia) and opinion; but thefictitious man, or the irrational foul, commences from the phanta­sy, under which desire and anger subsist. Hence the basis ofthe rational life is opinion, but the summit of the irrational life isthe phantasy. But the phantasy, as Jamblichus beautifully ob­serves, glows upon, as it were, and fashions all the powers ofthe foul; exciting in opinion the illuminations from the fenses,and fixing in that life which is extended with body the impres­sions which descend from intellect. Hence, says Proclus, it foldsitself about the indivisibility of true intellect, conforms itself toall formless species, and becomes perfectly every thing, fromwhich cogitation and our indivisible reason consist.
This being the cafe, as the phantasy is all things passivelywhich intellect is impassively (on which account Aristotle callsthe phantasy passive intellect), hence the head of the Sphinx ishuman, but at the fame time of the feminine sex; this sexbeing the image from its passivity of irrational life. By theSphinx having the body of a dog, the discriminating power ofthe phantasy is implied: for a dog, as we have stiewn before, isthe image of the discriminating power of the soul (to Siaxpilixoim ^vyjr.f). By her having the tail of a dragon, and the clawsof a lion, the communication of the phantasy with desire andanger is signified. And her wings are images of the elevatingpowers which the phantasy naturally possesses; for it is re-ele­vated, in conjunction with the returning foul, to the region everyway resplendent with light. But the riddles of the Sphinx areimages of the obscure and intricate nature of the phantasy. Hetherefore, who is unable to solve the riddles of the Sphinx,i. e. who cannot comprehend the dark and perplexed nature ofthe phantasy, will be drawn into her embraces and torn in pieces;i. e. the phantasy in such a one will subject to its power therational Use! cause its indivisible energies to become divisible,

CHAP. XIII.
ThE ancestors indeed of Epaminondas were very illus­trious; but his father, with respect to possessions, was butof the middle rank among the Thebans. However, hetook care to have his son accurately instructed in all thedisciplines belonging to his country: and Epaminondashimself, when he was but a youth, betook himself to Lysisthe Tarentine, who was skilled in the doctrine of Pytha­goras the Samian. But in the war which the Lacedæ­monians waged with the Mantinenses, Epaminondas issaid to have been sent with other Thebans to the aid ofthe Lacedæmonians. In this battle he saved Pelopidas,who, through a great wound which he received, was onthe very brink of destruction; and afterwards being sentas an ambassador to Sparta, when the Lacedæmonians de­creed to establish that peace which was called the peaceof Antalcidas, Agesilaus asked him whether the Thebanshad suffered the Bceotians in their respective cities toswear to the peace. To this interrogation Epaminondasreplied, By no means, O Spartan, till we find that thecities which border on your dominions have sworn. Butas soon as the war between the Lacedæmonians and The-,bans commenced, and the Lacedæmonians, trusting bothto their own power and that of their allies, pressed verymuch on the Thebans, Epaminondas with a part of theTheban army fixed his camps above the marsh Cephissis,as he perceived that in this part the Peloponnesians weredisposed to make an attack.

It is not therefore by any means proper to disbelievethese accounts: hut we ought to think that at first, nature beingvery vigorous caused every thing to approach near to the perfec­tion of the gods* j and that becoming afterwards debilitated, themagnitude of bodies also decreased. I am likewise informed,that at Rhodes there are bones which far surpass in magnitudethe bones of men of the present day.

"Eumachus, in his description of the earth, says that the Car--thaginians, when they were digging a trench in their own coun­try, found two skeletons placedfin coffins, one of which wattwenty-three, and the other twenty-four cubits in length.
"And Theopompus Sinopenfis, in hisTreatise on Earthquakes,fays, that a sudden earthquake happening in the CimmerianBosphorus, a certain hill was rent asunder, and bones of a pro­digious magnitude were thrown out of it: for the length of thewhole skeleton was found to be twenty-four cubits.

7* THE DESCRIPTION


mount Helicon is the river Lamusy which is not large iand in the borders of the Thespians there is a plaoe calledHedonacon, which contains the fountain of Narcissus.They fay that Narcissus beheld himself in this fountain }that he did not know he was in love himself; and thathe died through this love by the side of the fountain. Tobe in love indeed with a shadow, and not to know thedifference between a man and the shadow of a man, isstupidity in the extreme. But there is another reportconcerning Narcissus, which is less known thrn the formerone -, and this is, that he had a twin sister, who perfectlyresembled him in her whole form, that her hair and dresswere similar to those of Narcissus, and that they used togo out together to hunt. That Narcissus fell in Jove withthis sister ; and that slie happening to die before hini, heused to come to this fountain, in which, when he sawhis own shadow, without at the same time perceiving thatit was his own, he found some mitigation of the tormentsof his love, by imagining that it was the image of his sister.It appears to me, however, that the earth produced theflower Narcissus, prior to this circumstance; and m»opinion is confirmed by the verses of Pamphus. For hefays, that many years before the Thespian Narcissus,Proserpine the daughter of Ceres was forcibly takenaway by Pluto, as she was playing and gathering flowers jand that she was deceived not by violets, but by theparcissus.

this substance for lamps, -when burnt with oil, give a perpetual Tight,•without requiring frtjh supply- By the smell too of these lamps,those that labour under the falling sickness are detected. Thi»Hone grows in Carystus, from whence it derives its name. Itlikewise abounds in that part of Cyprus through which youdescend from Gerandrum towards Soli, on the left hand of El-mæus beneath the rocks. This stone increases about the fullmoon, and is diminished when the moon decreases." It appearsfrom this curious passage, that this stone Carystius must be the-same with lir.um vivum, or ajbeftinum.
What Plutarch too, in his treatise, Why the Oracles cease I*jive answers, says concerning the non-existence of this stone inhis time, particularly deserves the attention of the philosophicreader. "It is not long (fays he) since the quarry of Carystushas ceased to yield a certain soft stone, which used to be drawninto a fine thread 5 for I suppose that some here have seen tow­els, net-work, and coifs, woven of that tiiread which could notbe burnt; but when they were soiled with using, people threwthem into the fire, and took them out white and clean; for thefire only served to purify them. But all this is vanished, andnothing is to be found in the quarry now, but some few fibres orharry threads, lying scattered up and down. Aristotle and hi.followers affirm, that the cause of all this is owing to an exha­lation within the earth, the phainomena proceeding from whichfail, or again make their appeaiance, when this exhalation fails,or revives and recovers itself again." The reason why this stonesometimes fails, and at others appears again,can only be satisfacto­rily accounted for by that theory respecting fertile and barren pe­riods, which the reader will find unfolded in the note to page 104.
With respect to the lamp mentioned by Pausanias, whetherits burning day and night for a year was entirely owing to thewick being made of Carpalian flax, so that the lamp was notlarger than the lamps used in common, deserves tobe investigatedby the curious in natural researches.

But the Thespians venerated, from the first, Love be­yond all the gods: and they have a most ancient statue ofthis divinity, which is nothing more than a rude stone. Ido not however know who it was that instituted this highveneration of Love among theThefpians. The Pariani, too,who dwell about the Hellespont, and who originated fromIonia, and migrated hither from Erythræ, but at presentare in subjection to the Romans, venerate this divinity noless than the Thespians. The multitude are of opinion,that Love is the youngest of the gods, and the son ofVenus. But the Lycian Olen, who composed the mostancient hymns for the Greeks, fays in his hymn to Lucina,that Lucina is the mother of Love. And Pamphus andOrpheus, who flourished after Olen, have composed hymnsto Love, that they might be fung by the Lycomedæ duringthe celebration of the mysteries. I likewise once spoke witha torch-bearer of the Eleusinian mysteries, and throughhis means read these hymns of Pamphus and Orpheus, ofwhich I shall make no farther mention. Hesiod, indeed,or at least the author of the 1 heogony, I well know,says, that Chaos was first generated, afterwards Earth,and then Tartarus and Love.

Tanagræans fay, that their city was built by Poemandrus,the son of Chærefilaus, the grandso n of Iafius, and thegreat grandson of Elemher, who was the son of Apolioand Æthusa the daughter of Neptune. This Poemandrusmarried Tanagra the daughter of Ædlus ; though Corinnain her verses fays, that Tanagra was the daughter of Aso-pus. However, (he lived to so great an age, that she wagcalled by her neighbours Graia, or the grey, instead ofTanagra; and, in process of time, this name was givento the city, and remained so long, that it is mentioned byHomer ii„ his catalogue of the Greeks:
"Thefpia, Graia, Myealcfius broad."
In after-times, however, it recovered its pristine name.There is a monument too of Orion in Tanagra, and artountain Cercyius, in Which they fay Mercury was born.There is likewise a place called Poloson: and here theysay Atlas fat, diligently investigating subterranean andcelestial affairs. And that Homer, agreeable to this, faysof Atlas:.

And this alteration was made fry*Pierus, either because it appeared to him to be wiser, or inconsequence of some oracle, or as the result of what he hadlearned from the Thracians. For formerly the Thraciansseem to have excelled the Macedonians in dexterity inhuman affairs, and not to have been so negligent as theywere in divine concerns. There are those, too, who saythat Pierus had nine daughters, and that he called themby the names of the Muses; and that the grandchildrenof Pierus by these daughters were called by the nameswhich the Greeks give to the offspring of the Muses.But Mimnermus, who composed elegies respecting thebattle of the Smyrntcans against Gyges and the Lydians,fays in the preface to this work, that the more ancie.itMuses are the daughters of Heaven, and that those ofposterior origin are the daughters of Jupiter.
In Helicon, too, as you go to the grove of the Muses,you will fee on the left hand the fountain Aganippe. Theyfay that Aganippe was the daughter of Termessus, whichflows round mount Helicon. But if you proceed to thisgrove in a straight line, you will fee a stone image of Eu-pheme. This Eupheme is said to have been the nurse ofthe Muses. After her image there is a statue of Linusin a small stone, which is carved so as to resemble, acavern. They perform funeral sacrifices every year to thispoet, before they sacrifice to the Muses. It is said that Linuswas the son of Urania by Amphiaraus the son of Nep­tune. The renown which he acquired for his skill in music,was superior not only to that of his contemporaries, butto that of all his predecessors: and he is said to have beenslain by Apollo for attempting to compare his skill insinging with that of the god.

But among the Thebans, before the gate called Proetx,there is that which is denominated the gymnasium osIolaus: there is likewise a stadium, like that in Olympia,or that among the Laurians; for it is a heap of earth.In the fame place too they shew the heroic monument ofIolaus, who, as the Thebans acknowledge, died in Sar­dinia j the Athenians and Thespienses passing over withhim to that city at the fame time* Having proceeded be­yond the right hand part of the stadium, you will arrive atthe Hippodrome, in which there is a sepulchre of Pindar.It is said of Pindar, that when he was a young man, as hewas going to Thespia, being wearied with the heat, as itwas noon, and in the height of summer, he fell asleep at asmall distance from the public road j and that bees, as hewas asleep, flew to him and wrought their honey on his lips.This circumstance first induced Pindar to compose verses.Bat when his reputation spread through all Greece, thePythian deity ra.sed his glory to a still greater height, byordering the Delphi to assign to Pindar an equal part ofthose first-fruits which were offered to Apollo. It is alsosaid, that when he was an old man, he saw in a dreamProserpine standing by him, who at the same time told

Elpenor is represented aboveEriphyle and Ulysses kneeling, and holding a sword overa ditch. The prophet Tiresias approaches to the ditch;and after Tiresias, Anticlea the mother of Ulysses is seensitting on a stone. Elpenor is covered with a mat madeof bulrushes, after the manner of sailors, instead of a gar­ment. Theseus and Pirithous fit on a throne below Ulysses:and of these Theseus holds the sword of Pirithous, andhis own sword, in both his hands; but Pirithous looks atthe swords, and seems to be indignant that he has noweapons to accomplish his daring enterprise. PanyaGsaflerts in his verses, that Theseus and Pirithous were notbound to the throne like captives, but that a stone grewto their skin, and served instead of bonds. Homer in bothhis poems mentions the celebrated friendship of Theseus?nd Pirithous. For Ulysses thus speaks to the Phæacians;
"Th' illustrious Theseus' and Pirithous' sliades,Fam'd sons of gods, I then perhaps had seen."
And in the Iliad, Nestor, when he exhorts Agamemnonand Achilles to lay aside their enmity, thus speaks:
"A godlike race of heroes once I knew,
Such as no more these aged eyes shall view! ,

The Carthaginians built in this island two cities*Carnalis and Sylli: but a dispute arising concerningthe spoil, the Libyans and Spaniards revolted from theCarthaginians, and settled themselves in the elevatedparts of the island. The Corn call these people in theirnative tongue, Balaroi i for thus they denominate exiles.And such are the nations which inhabit Sardinia, andsuch the cities into which it is divided. But those partsof the island which are situated towards the north, andthe coast of Italy, are nothing but mountains difficult ofaccess, and whose summits are conjoined with each other.These parts, however, afford a very good harbour forships; and strong and irregular winds rush from the top»of the neighbouring mountains into the sea. In the middleof the island too there are less elevated mountains; butthe air in this part is very turbid and noxious. The reasonof this is the fait which becomes concreted here, and theheavy and violent south-wind which blows from thesemountains. The northern winds, too, through the lofti­ness of the mountain* towards the Italian coast, are pre­vented from refrigerating the ground and the air in sum­mer. Others are of opinion, that the island Corsica, whichis separated from Sardinia by not more than eight stadiaof sea, and which is on all sides mountainous and elevated,prevents the west and north winds from reaching as faras Sardinia.

the Thebans were accustomed to protract their publicassemblies for a long time, they watched the time of theirassembling together, and, whenever this happened, cul­tivated their land in peace. But Neocles the Theban, whowas then the chief magistrate of the Bœotians, perceivingthe crafty conduct of the Platæenses, ordered each of theThebans to come into the assembly armed, and immedi­ately led them, not in a direct line from Thebes throughthe fields, but to Hyfia, which is between the Eleuthe-rans and Attica, and where the Platæenses had no spies.This took place about the middle of the day: and thePlatæenses, supposing that the Thebans were engaged intheir assembly, came into their fields as usual, having thegates of the city securely closed behind them. Th«Thebans therefore made the Platæenses that were withinthe walls promise, that they would leave the city beforesun-set; each man bringing with him one> and eachwoman two garments. At that time, indeed, the Platæ­enses were oppressed in a manner very different from thatwhich took place formerly through the Lacedæmonians,under the command of Archidamus: for then when theyjvere besieged they were prevented from leaving the cityby a twofold wall; but here the Thebans would not sufferthem to enter into their walls. This second loss happenedto the Platæenses, in the third year prior to the battle atLeuctra, and when Asteus was the Athenian archon;Every part of the city at this time was destroyed by theThebans, except the temples of the gods.

And thiscity was afflicted with many calamities in common withthe Phocenses: the Damon likewise prepared for themprivate misfortunes through the Macedonians. But it wasthrough the means of Olympiodorus that the siege of Caf-fander and the Macedonians was rendered ineffectual.Philip, however, the son of Demetrius, having corruptedthe principal persons of the city by gifts, raised the greatestterror in the minds of the common people. But TitusFlaminius, being sent from Rome in order to give libertyto Greece, declared that he would restore the Elatæansto their ancient polity, if they would only revolt from theMacedonians. However, whether it was through the stu­pidity of the common people, or the persuasion of theirrulers, they continued faithful to Philip, and sufferedthemselves to be besieged by the Romans.
Some time after this they sustained the siege of Taxi-lus, who commanded the army of Mithridates and ofthe Barbarians from Pontus •, and for this the Romansgave them their liberty. When, too, in my time the Cos-toboci, who were a band of robbers, infested Greece bytheir depredations, and penetrated as far as to Elatea,Mnesibulus, having collected a number of chosen men,made a great daughter of the Barbarians, but fell himselfin the engagement.

colossal statues of Minerva and Hercules, of Pentelicanstone, and made by Alcamenes. A gymnafium and sta­dium too of Hercules are contiguous to this temple. Butabove the stone Sophronister there is an altar of Apollo,who is called Spondios: and this altar is raised from theasties of victims. Divination from omens is here esta­blished ; which I know the Smyrnæans use beyond all theGreeks. For in the outward inclosure of their walls theyhave a temple, raised for the purpose of receiving omens.


J. HE Thebans too, in ancient times, sacrificed bulls toApollo Polios, or the hoary. But it once happened in thisfestival, that when the time for slaying the victim was atfiand. and those that were sent for the bull did notcome as they were expected, the sacrificers met witha car drawn bv two oxen, one of which they sacri­ficed to the gcd; and from this circumstance they after­wards thought proper to sacrifice labouring oxen. Thefollowing circumstance likewise is related by the Thebans:When Cadmus came from the Delphi to Phocis, he fol­lowed an ox as his guide. This ox was bought of theherdsmen of Pelagos, and hail on each of its fides a whitespot resembling the full moon. It was necessary, there­fore, that Cadmus and his army, by the command of anoracle, should fix their residence in that place in whichshe ox when weary laid itself down to rest.

Hence, certain poets call Eteocles in their verses, Cephi-fiades. This Eteocles, when he began to reign, sufferedthem to call the country from Andreus. But lie institutedtwo tribes, one of which he ordered to be called Cephi-fiades, and the other after his own name Eteoclea. WhenHalmus, too, the son of Sisyphus, came to him, he gavehim but a small part of the country for his portion: andthe towns were called Halmones from Halmus. But inafter times, one town alone came to be called Halmones.

1 H E Bœotians-, too, fay that Eteocles was the first thatsacrificed to the Graces. And, indeed, that he establishedthree Graces they are well convinced j but they have lostthe remembrance of the names which he gave them. Forthe Lacedsemonians only worship two Graces, tlie statuesof which, they fay, were dedicated by Lacedæmon theson os Taygete, who also gave them the names of Cletaand Phaenna. These names, indeed, are very properlygiven to the Graces, as likewise are those names whichare assigned to the Graces by the Athenians. For theAthenians have from ancient times venerated the Graces,Auxo arid Hegemone. And as to Carpus, it is not a nameof one of the Graces, but of one of the Seasons. Butthe Athenians worship the other of the Seasons, together■with Pandrosus, arid call this diviriity Thalloie, or thejkurijbing.

gfeatest alacrity in restoring Thebes to its pristine state;and they were joined in this by the Messenians and Mega-lopolitans. But it appears to me that Cassander rebuiltThebes, principally through his hatred of Alexander:for he endeavoured totally to destroy all his house. Thushe delivered up Olympias the mother of Alexander to bestoned to death, by those Macedonians who violently hatedher, and destroyed by poison Hercules the son of Alex­ander by Barfina, and Alexander his son by Roxana. Hedid not, however, depart rejoicing from the present life;for he was seized with a dropsy, through which he wasdevoured by vermin. Of his sons, too, the eldest, Philip,not long after he began his reign, was attacked with atabid disease. Antipater who succeeded him slew hismotheT Thessalonice, who was the daughter of Philip theson of Amyntas by Nicafipolis. His reason for commit­ting this parricide, was her extreme fondness of Alexander,the youngest of Antipater's sons. Alexander, however,caHing to his assistance Demetrius the son of Antigonus,stew Antipater, and thus revenged the murder of hismother.
Some god, therefore, deservedly punished Cassanderfor his guilty conduct. However, all the ancient inclo­sure os Thebes was restored to the Thebans by Cassander.But it was requisite, that they should afterwards taste ofthe greatest evils. * For when Mithidrates warred on theRomans, the Thebans assisted him in this war, for no otherreason, as it appears to me, than their friendstiip to theAthenians. But when Sylla led his army into Bceotia,the Thebans were terrified, and, immediately changingtheir intentions, joined themselves to the Romans.

They also dedicated Erafus the son of Triphylus. Butwith respect to the artificers of these statues, Apollo andCallisto were made by Pausanias the Apollonian; Victory,and the image of Areas, by Dædalus the Sicyonian;Triphylus and Azah, by Areas Samolas; and Elatus,Aphidas, and Erafus, by the Argive Antiphanes. Thesestatues the Tegeatæ sent to Dtelphos, in consequence ashaving made the Lacedæmonians captives, who madehostile incursions on their borders. Opposite to these arcthe offerings which the Lacedæmonians dedicated whenthey vanquished the Athenians, viz. the Dioscuri, Jupiter,Apollo, Diana; and together with these, Neptune andLysander the son of Aristocretus, receiving a crown fromNeptune. There are besides, Abas, who prophesied toLysander, and-Hermon, who was the pilot of Lysander'9prætorian sliip. Thcocofmus the Mtgarensian made thisstatue of Hermon, when he was ranked among the citi­zens of the Megarenses. But the Dioscuri were made bythe Argive Antiphanes. The prophet Abas was made byPauson from Calaurea belonging to the Troezenians.Damias made Diana, Neptune, and Lysander; and Athe-nodorus Apollo and Jupiter. Both these artists were Ar­cadians from Clitov. Behind the statues which we havejust mentioned, the statues of those men are placed whoalsisted Lysander in the battle at Ægospotamos, and whowere either Spartans, or the allies of the Spartans. Andthese ave as follow: Aracus and Erianches, the former aLacedæmonian, and the latter a Bœotian from Mimas.After these Astycrares, Cephisocles, Hermophantus, Hici-sius, Chians; '1 imarchus and Diagoras, Rhodians; Theo-

The Greeks, too, in other relations differ very much fromeach other. The Thcbans have besides, in this place, mo­numents of the children of Amphion, the male beingapart from the female offspring.


CHAP. XVII.
Near these is the temple of Diana Eucleia, or the re­nowned : and the statue of the goddess in it was made byScopas. They fay that the daughters of Antipcenus, An-droclea and Alcida, are buried in this temple. For whenthe Thebans led by Hercules were about to engage withthe Orchomenians, they were told by an oracle, that thearmy would be victorious out of which a citizen of themost illustrious birth should destroy himself. Antipcenus,therefore, was the chief of all his fellow citizens with re­spect to the splendor of his origin; but he could not bepersuaded to kill himself for the good of his country. Hisdaughters, however, cheerfully devoted themselves for theaccomplishment of this end: and for this they were pub­licly honoured. Before this temple of Diana Eucleia thereis a lion of stone, which they fay was dedicated by Her-,cules after he had vanquished the Orchomenians, andtheir king Erg'tnus the son of Clymenus. Near this templethere is a statue of Boedromian Apollo, and a statue ofJudicial Mercury, which was dedicated by Pindar. Thefuneral pile of the children of Amphion is about half astadium distant from their sepulchres. The ashes yet re­main upon this funeral pile.

turning to the left hand, you will see an inclosure, whichcontains the tomb of Neoptolemus the son of Achilles,to whom the Delphi perform funeral sacrifices every year.On ascending from this monument, you will see a stoneof a moderate size. This they anoint with oil every day,and during every festival cover it with new-stiorn wool.They are of opinion respecting this stone, that it wasjyven to Saturn as a substitute for the infant Jupiter, andthat he afterwards threw it up by a vomit. On leavingthis stone, and directing your course aa if back again tothe temple, you will see a fountain which is called CassotisThere is a wall of a moderate size before it: and throughthe wall there is a passage of ascent to the fountain. Theyfay, that the water of this fountain merges itself in theearth, and causes the women in the adytum of the godto possess prophetic powers. They add, that the foun­tain was denominated from one of the nymphs aboutParnaflus.


CHAP. XXV.
BEYOND the fountain Cassotis there is a buildingwhich contains the pictures of Polygnotus, which werededicated by the Gnidians. The Delphi call this buildingLtfche; because formerly men used to discuss serious andtrifling affairs in it. Homer, in the abusive speech ofMelantho to Ulysses, evinces that there were many suchplaces in every part of Greece:
"Hence to the Lefcbe, from the midnight air,Or some bLck forge the vagrant's haunt repair."

Dionys. informsus, that these seven gates were raised agreeably to the numberand order of the seven planets; so that the first gate was assignedto the Moon, the second to Mercury, the fourth to the Sun,under the appellation of Electra, a surname of Phaethon, thefifth to Mars, the third to Venus, the sixth to Jupiter, and theseventh to Saturn. By this is meant, that the properties of theseven planets are participated by the sublunary world. For asCadmus is the deity of the sublunary region, the city Thebes^which he is said to have built, and in which, according to thefable, he resided, must be an image of the body of the sublunaryworld.

But fables, inmy opinion, intend to signify by Helen all the beauty subsistingabout generation, for which there is a perpetual battle «f fouls,till the more intellectual, having vanquished the more irrationalforms of life, return to that place from which they originallycame. But, according to some, the period of their circulationabout sensible forms consists of ten thousand years, since a thou­sand years produce one ambit as of one year. For nine yearstherefore, i. e. for nine thousand years, fouls revolve about ge­neration; but in the tenth having vanquished all the barbarictumult, they are said to have returned to their paternal habi­tations." I only add farther, that the English reader who itdesirous of understanding the mystic meaning of the Odyssey,may perhaps find his expectations not entirely disappointed byperusing the notes to my translation of Porphyry on Homer'*Cave of the Nymphs, in vol. ii. of Proclus on Euclid.

Among the Tanagneans, thereare two kinds of cocks, the game, and those which theycall cojsuphoi, or black birds. The size of these cossuphoiis the fame with that of the Lydian birds, but their colourTesombles that of a crow. Their gills, too, and crestsresemble an anemony: and they have white spots, not verylarge, on the extremity of their bill and tail. But in thatpart of Bceotia which is on the left hand of the Euripusjthere is a fountain called Messapios, and under it is themaritime city of the Bœotians, Anthedon. Accordingto some, the city was thus denominated from the nymphAnthedon; but according to others, from Anthan theson of Neptune, by Alcyone the daughter "of Atlas, be­cause Anthan once reigned in this place. Among theAnthedonians, near the middle of their city, there is atemple of the Cabiri; and about it there is a grove ofCeres, and a temple of Proserpine. The statue of thegoddess is of white stone. Before the city, too, and to­wards the more interior part of the country, there is atemple of Bacchus, and in it there is a statue of the god.In this place likewise there are sepulchres of Iphimedca,and the sons of Aloeus, who were flain by Apollo inNaxos, which is above Paros, both according to Homerand Pindar. The sepulchres of these too are in Anthe­don. Near the sea there is a place which they call thethicket of Glaucus.

It is a wonderful circum­stance that, in this country, swallows neither breed, norlay eggs, nor build their nests on the roofs of houses.The Phocenses fay, that when Philomela was changedinto a bird, she flew from the country of Tereus throughfear of him. But the Daulienscs have a temple of Minerva,in which there is an ancient statue of the goddess. Itlikewise contains a more ancient wooden statue, whichthey fay Procne brought from Athens. A place calledThronius forms a part of the Daulian land: and- in thisplace there is an heroic monument, dedicated to that herofrom whom the people here derived their origin. Somefay, that this hero was Xanthippus, a man of no obscurereputation in warlike affairs: but others are of opinion,that he was Phocus the son of Ornytion, and the grand­son of Sisyphus. This hero they venerate every day; andafter they have slain the victims which they sacrifice tohim, they pour the blood through a hole into the se-,pulchre, and consume the entrails in the fame place.There is an eminence in Daulis, by which you mayascend to the summits of mount Parnassus.

Page 61. ^Theseus, when he departed to flay the Minotaur"] Theexplanation given by the moderns of the Minotaur, and the otherparts of the fable to which it belongs, is as absurd and foreignfrom the truth, as any of their solutions of ancient fables. "Ishall make it appear (fays the Abbe Banier* with all the lav/'less levity of a Frenchman, and in the true spirit of a Catholicdivine) that the Minotaur, with Pafipbac, and the rest of thatfable, contain nothing but an intrigue of the queen os Cretewith a captain named Taurus; ;. d the :-rtiLi.c of Dædalus onlya fly confident." And in this impudent manner he explainsthe most celebrated lables of antiquity. It is true indeed, thatmy own countrymen are at present unacquainted with the divinewisdom of the ancients; but I do not know of any English writerthat has attempted to explain the Grecian fables in a mani er soimpertinenti trifl'ng, and absurd. Surely every thinking mindmust unite with me in acknowledging, that if the ancients intend­ed to conceal in their fables nothing more than what Banier pre­sents us with, their fables are far more puerile than the riddlescomposed by the ingenious Mr. Newbery for children. LordBacon, though far from penetrating the profound meaning ofthe ancients in these fables, saw enough to be convinced that theywere replete with the highest wisdom of which he had any con­ception; and has done all in attempting to unfold them thatgreat genius without the assistance ot genuine philosophy is able toeffect, But the most piercing sagacity, the most brilliant wit, andthe most exquisite subtilty of thought, without this assistance, arehere of no avail.
It is indeed easy for ingenious men to give an explanation ofan ancient fable, which to the superficial observer shall appear tobe the precise meaning which its inventor designed to convey,though it be in reality very far from the truth. This may beeasily accounted for by considering, that all fables are images of* Vol. i. of the translation of his Mythology, p. 29.

It is not at all improbable there­fore that a nymph of the sea was connected with Selemus, whowhen he died attracted to himself through intemperate desire avehicle perfectly humid, by which he became bound as it wereto a certain stream, and was therefore said to have been changedinto a river by Venus.
Page 233. He cut offthe genitals of his father Heaven.'} Theauthors of fables invented images of divine concerns in Imitationof Nature, who shadows forth by parts things destitute ofall parts, by temporal eternal natures, by dimensions thing!void of quantity, by sensibles intelligibles, and so on. Forthese divine men by preternatural concerns adumbrated the trans-tendent nature of the gods; by such as ar: irrational, a power moredivine than all reason; and by things apparently base, incorporealbeauty. Hence, in the fable alluded to in this place by Pausanias,we must consider the genital parts as symbols ofprolific power; andthe castration of these parts, as signifying the progression of thispower into a subject order. So that the fable means, that the pro-lisic powers of Heaven are called forth into progression by Saturn,who is a deity of an inferior order. The utility arising fromfables of this kind, to such as properly understand them, is verygreat. For they call forth our unperverted conceptions of divinenatures, give a greater perfection to the divine part of our soul,through its sympathy with mystic concerns, heal the maladies ofour phantasy, and elevate it in conjunction with our rational partto supernal light.

The Ambryssenses too have a forum not verylarge, and many of the stone statues which it containsare broLen. On directing your course to Anticyra, youwill find the road at first steep ; but after you have ascend-»ed it for about two stadia it becomes level. And on theright hand of this road there is a temple of DictynnæanDiana. The Ambryssenses particularly reverence this god­dess : and her statue is of Æginean workmanship, and ismade of black stone.
All the road from this temple of Diana to Anticyra ison the ascent. They say that the more ancient name of thecity is Cyparissus ; and that Homer, in his catalogue of thePhocenfes, chooses rather to call this city Cyparissus thanAnticyra; for then it began to be called Anticyra. Theyadd, that Anticyreus was contemporary with Hercules.This city lies under the ruins of Medeon. In the begin­ning too of this account of the Phocensian affairs, I have(hewn that Medeon was one of those cities that plunderedthe temple of Apollo.

"But in die watry element he is the cause of fertility, facilityof motion, and all-various powers: for, according to the poet*,
From him the sea and ev'ry river flows.
In earth he is the source of generative perfection, of the dis­tinction of forms, and of generation and corruption. Hence,such terrestrial orders as are vivific and demiurgic he defines;and such powers as comprehend the reasons of earth, and are theinfpective guardians of generation, he excites and multiplies,and calls forth into motion." And shortly after, he adds,"that Ocean in fine is the cause of all motion; intellectual, be­longing to fouls ; and natural, to all secondary natures: but Te-tbjs is the cause.of all the distinction os the streams proceedingfrom the Ocean, conferring on each a proper purity of naturalmotion."
I only add, that it is peculiar to the Platonic philosophy tosuspend physics from theology, and this in imitation of Orpheus,who suspends Nature herself from the vivisic goddess Rhea, whois the cause of all life, both that which is intellectual, and thatwhich is inseparable from the fluctuating nature of bodies.This peculiarity must surely be pleasing to every one that isnot atheistically inclined; at the fame time, that by leading usup to such principles as are truly first, it enables us to removethe veil which conceals the mystic wisdom of the ancients, andcauses it to appear in the eyes of the multitude inextricably con­fused, and beyond all comparison absurd. The trutli of thisobservation will be immediately assented to, by any one whounderstands the above explanation of Ocean.

But the most remarkable particulars in the groveare a temple of Trophonius, and a statue, which may beconjectured to be that of Æsculapius. This statue wasmade by Praxiteles. There is also a temple here of CeresEuropa: and in the open air there is a temple of JupiterPluvius,
As you ascend to the place from which the oracleis given, and pass on to the anterior part of the moun­tain, you will fee a temple of Proserpine the huntressand Jupiter the king. This temple, either through itsmagnitude, or through unceasing wars, was left halffiniQied. In another temple which stands here there arestatues of Saturn, Juno, and Jupiter. There is also inthis place a temple of Apollo. With respect to what per­tains to this oracle, when any one desires to descend intothe ca*e of Trophonius, he must first take up his resiidence for a certain number of days in a building destinedto this purpose. This building is a temple of the GoodDamon, and of Guod Fortune. While he stays here he pu­rifies himself in other respects, and abstains from hotbaths. The river Hercyna is used by him for a bath:and he is well supplied with animal food from the vic­tims which are sacrificed. For he who descends hither,sacrifices to Trophonius and his sons; to Apollo, Sa­turn, and Jupiter the king; to Juno the rhariot drhi-rtand to Ceres, whom they call Europa, and who theyfay was the nurse of Trophonius.

guardian of Laodamas the son of Eteocles. I know, too,that at present the Thebans choose as the annual priest ofApollo Ismenios, a boy illustrious for his origin, and ofgreat beauty and strength. This boy is called Daphnophoros,because ht is crowned -with laurel. But I am not certainwhether all the boys that are crowned with laurel dedi­cate a brazen tripod to Apollo. It appears to me, thatall are not obliged to do this by law; for I did not feemany tripods dedicated here. The wealthier fort of theseboys however dedicate tripods: and among these, thatwhich Amphitryon dedicated,withHercules on it crownedwith laurel, is the most illustrious, both for its antiquityand the renowH of the person by whom it was sent as anoffering. Beyond this temple of Ismenian Apollo you willsee a fountain, which they say is sacred to Mars: andthey add, that a dragon is stationed here by Mars asthe guardian of the fountain. Near this is the tomb ofCaanthus, who they fay was the brother of Melia, andthe son of Ocean ; and who was sent by his father to seekhis sister that was forcibly taken away. But when hesound that (he was in the power of Apollo, and that in con­sequence of this he was not able to take her away, he hadthe boldness to set on fire the grove- of Apollo, whichthey call Ismenion; and for this action, as the Thebansfay, the god flew him with his arrows. They fay, too, thatApollo had two sons by Melia, Tenerus and Ismenius;and that Apollo endowed Tenerus with a prophetic power,but the river was denominated from Ismenius. However,prior to the birth of Ismenius this river was calledLadoa.

Page 109. But he that has h:cn initiated in th? Eleusinian mys­teries, SsV.] From the present passive, in conjunction with iomeother authorities which I shall adduce, we may collect no con­temptible argument in favour ot' the opinion, thai the Orphichymns which exist at present were the very lumns which wereused in the Eleusinian mysteries. "For (fays Pa;.tan:as) it is notlawful to alcribe the invention of beans to Ceres; and he that hasbeen initiated in the Eleusinian mysi cries, or has read the poemscalled Crphic, will kiiow wiiat I mean." Now Porphyry DeAbftintntia, lib 4, informs us, that kans were forbidden in theEleusinian mysteries*; and in the Orphic hymn to Earth, thefacrificer is oiticied to fumigate from every kind of feed, exceptbeans and aromatic:. Again, Suidas informs; us, that tixAimeans a mystic sacrifice, the greatest and most venerable of all others,Surta jxwi-»ipia;2»is, n ftiytrv *} rtfuAfa. And Proclus, whenever hespeaks of the Eleusinian mysteries, calls them the most holy tchtai,ayiulaiau TtAilsif. Agrteably to this, the Orphic hymns arecalled in the Thryllitian manuscript tAiIow: and Scaliger justlyobserves, that they contain nothing but such invocations aswere used in mysteries. Besides, many of the hymns are expresslythus called by the author of them. Thus the conclusion of thehymn to Protogonns invokes that deity to be present at "theholy telcte" fj ti*i1«i» œyiai: of the hymn to the stars, to be pre­sent "at the very learned labours of the illustriously-holy telcte:

These pillars therefore are images of disterminating, and at thefame time connecting powers, which by their efficacious vigoureternally prevent things on high from being confused with thingsbelow. Hence Atlas, who contains these powers, and who isone of the Tartarean gods about Bacchus, energizes not onlyaccording to a separating power, which is the characteristic ofthe Titans, but likewise according to a connecting power, whichis the characteristic of Jupiter.

Page 55. Cabiri.~\ It appears to me, that the celestial twinsare no other than the Curetes, according to their mundane sub­sistence. For the first subsistence of the Curetes is, as we learnfrom Proclus, in that order of gods which is denominated by the,Chaldxan theologists »ofpo; intellectual, and of which Saturn isthe summit. Their next subsistence is among the supermundanegods, in which order they are called the Corylanlei. And theirthird subsistence is doubtless that of the twins. For the Curetesin the Orphic hymns are celebrated as the twins. If this bethe case, and the Cabiri are, according to the Scholiast on Apol-lonius Rhodius, Ceres, Proserpine, Pluto and Mercury, theycannot be the same with either the Curetes, Corybantes, orDioscuri. For the Curetes, according to Proclus, are the guar­dian triad of the intellectual triad, Saturn, Rhea, and Jupiter,and he informs us that one of these Curetes is Minerva. The Co­rybantes, as we learn from the fame author, are the guardians ofthe Coric triad, Diana, Proserpine, and Minerva. And as to theDioscuri, or the twine, they are evidently different from theCabi ri mentioned by the Scholiast.

certain persons, who are called Speculators, to the Delphicgod, who gave them an oracle, signifying that they mustbring the bones of Heliod from the Naupactian to the Or-chomenian land, and that this would be the only means offreeing them from their malady. But upon their again inter­rogating the god, in what part of the Naupactian land thebones were deposited, the Pythian deity answered them,*hat a crow would shew them. As the messengers there­fore were proceeding on their journey, they saw not farfrom the road a crow sitting on a stone; and in the hol­low of this stone they found the bones of Hesiod, withthe following inscription on the tomb:
*' The senile Ascra is the native land0£ Hesiod, but the Minyæ, fkill'd to tameThe warlike need, his bones possess. His fameTrtie wisdom's votaries, of discernment nice,Through all th' Argolic land have widely spread."
With respect to Actxon, a report is circulated amongthe Orchomenians, that their land was injured by meansof a spectre, which sat on a stone; and that on their con­sulting the Delphic oracle about it, they were ordered bythe god to bury any remains of Actxon which they mighthappen to find; and besides this, to make a brazen imagepf the spectre, and fasten it with iron to the stone. Andthis statue I have seen. They perform too every yearfuneral sacrifices to Actæon. The temple of Hercules, inwhich there is a statue not large, is distant from Qrcho*menus about seven stadia.

As a punishment for this action, they wereafflicted with a pestilent disease; and at the same timewere ordered by the Delphic Oracle to sacrifice to Bacchusa boy in the flower of his youth. However, not manyyears after this, they fay, that the god changed the sa­crifice of a boy for that os a goat. Among the Potniæ,too, there is a well; and they report, that the horseswhich are natives of Potnix become mad by drinking thiswater. As you go from hence to Thebes, you will feeon the right hand of the road an inclosure, not very large,and in it certain pillars. They are of opinion that theearth opened in this place to Amphiaraus; and they fay,that birds will not sit on these pillars, nor grafs grow,nor any tame or savage animal feed in this place.
But the Thebans, in the inclosure of their ancientwall, have seven gates, which remain even at present. I haveheard that one of these gates was called Electra, fromElectra, the sister of Cadmus, and another Prcetæ, fromPrœtus, a native of this place. I have not, however, beenable to find at what time this Prœtus lived.

fled on the following night to the Ulyrians: and the As-gives delivered up Thebes, which they had taken, to Ther­sander the son of Polyniccs. As a great part, however,of the forces which Agamemnon led against Troy, wan­dered during their voyage from their destined course, andwere shipwrecked about Mysia, it happened that Ther-sander, who in valour surpassed most of the Greeks in that, war, was slain by Telephus. But the sepulchre of Ther­sander is in the plains of Caicus* in the city Ehea. This-sepulchre is of stone, and is in that«part of the forumwhich is in the open air; in which placej as they fay, theinhabitants perform funeral sacrifices in honour of him.After the death of Thersander, a second fleet being fittedout against Paris and the Trojans, the command of it wasgiven to Peneleus: for Tisamenus the son of Thersanderwas not yet old enough for this purpose. But Peneleusbeing slain by Eurypylus the son of Telephus, they choseTisamenus for their king, who was the son of Thersanderand Demonassa the daughter of Amphiaraus. This ThVmenus was free from the imprecations of Laiusand Oedi-*pus; but Autesion the son of Tisamenus did not escapethem, but was compelled on this account, in compliancewith an oracle, to migrate to the Dorienscs. After thedeparture of Autesion, Damafichthon, the grandson ofPeneleus the son of Opheltes^ was chosen king. Ptolemywas the son of this Damafichthon, and Xanthus of Pto-;lemy, I mean that Xanthus whom Andropompus slew ina single combat, by stratagem, and not in a lawful man­ner. Afterwards it appeared better to the Thebans tobe governed by many, and not to commit the administra^tion of affairs to one man alone.

circumstances which took place respecting it, piety forbidsme to disclose. The mysteries therefore of the Cabiriwere the gift of Ceres. But when the Epigoni led anarmy against Thebes, and Thebes was taken, the Cabiribeing driven from their country were not able for sometime to celebrate these mysteries. Afterwards, however,they were restored by Pelarge, the daughter of Potneus,in conjunction with her husband Isthmiades. And then,indeed, Pelarge initiated persons in these mysteries beyondthe ancient boundaries of the country: but Telondes, andthose of the Cabiri that were restored Jo their nativeland, celebrated the mysteries in Cabiræa. By an oracletoo given from Dodona, other honours were decreed toPelarge; and a victim big with young was ordered to besacrificed to her. Many instances likewise have evincedthat the wrath of the Cabiri is implacable. Far whencertain private persons in Naupactus had the boldness,to perform the ceremonies established by the Thebans,they were shortly after punistied for their impiety. Suchtoo of the forces of Xerxes as, together with Mardonius,pitched their camps in Bccotia, when they entered thetemple of the Cabiri, either allured by the hope of gain­ing great riches, or (as it appears to me) through theircontempt of a divine nature, became immediately insane:and some of them threw themselves into the sea, andOthers hurled themselves headlong from rocks. Thusagain, when Alexander had vanquished the Thebans, anddestroyed all Thebes by. sire, such of the Macedonians asentered the temple of the Cabiri, because they were uponhostile ground, were destroyed by thunder and lightning.So holy has this temple been fj^ni the beginning.

Two obelisks are raised onthis wall, which, as well as the zones that hold them to­gether, are of brass. Between these there are doors: andwithin the inclosure there is a chasm of the earth, whichwas not formed by nature, but was made by art, and isexcavated in according proportion with consummate ac­curacy and (kill. The shape of this chasm resembks thatof an oven. Its breadth, measured diametrically, may beconjectured to be about sour cubits. Its depth does notappear to me more than eight cubits. There are notsteps to its bottom: but when any one designs to descendto Trophonius, they give him a ladder, which is bothnarrow and light. On descending into this chasm, be­tween its bottom and summit there is a small cavern, th«breadth of which is about two spans, and its altitude apjpears to be about one span.

From the pillars too there are steps toeach of its walls: and on these steps' the Phocenfes fitwhen they assemble. But near the extremity of the build­ing there are neither pillars nor steps. There is how­ever here a statue of Jupiter sitting on a throne; and onhis right hand there is a statue of Juno, and on his leftof Minerva. Proceeding from hence, .you will arrive ata road which they call Schifte, or cut; and in this roadOedipus murdered his father. Indeed, every part ofGreece contains some monument of the calamities ofOedipus. For as soon as he was born, his parents boredthe soles of his feet, and exposed him on the mountainCithasron belonging to the Platæcnfes. Corinth, and thecountry about the Isthmus, educated him. Phocis, andthe road Schiste, were polluted with his father's blood.And the Thebans are rendered infamous by the mar­riages of Oedipus, aud the base conduct of Eteocles-Howevcr, the daring action of Oedipus in the road Schistewas tthe origin of all his calamities.

For every god, as I have before observed, confer*,the characteristic oshi3 nature on ail its participants; and thoseheroic souls that have at times appeared on the earth, and of whomwe have given an account in a former note, conscious that theypossessed the properties of those gods from whom they descended,calied themselves by tbt names of their parent divinities. Thusheroic fouls who descended from Jupirer, called themselves by thename of that god. Thus a hero Æsculapius has lived among men,who descended from the god os that name. This too has been thecafe with an heroic Bacchus, Mercury, Apollo, and in short withheroes of the fame names with all the other gods. Hence we mustconsider Hercules as a hero who descended from the deity of thatname, who in his highelt subsistence, according to the Orphictheology, is the fame with the celebrated Phanes or Prutogmus,the exemplar of the universe. Ag heroic souls therefore of thiskind were, as we have before observed, called by the ancientsgods according to similitude, or in other words, from their ap­proaching to the perfection of a divine nature as much as is pos­sible to man, and particularly when liberated, from the presentbody ;—hence it is easy to see how Hercules may be a god, andyet a man; how the hero Hercules may be said to have been dei-sied after his death, without confounding the divine with the hu­man nature; and in short, how ignorance of this mojl importantparticular has given birth to the delirious systems of modern wri­ters on mythology.

In the lowest partsof the picture, after the Thracian Thamyris, you will feeHector fitting with both his hands on his left knee, andexhibiting the appearance of a man oppressed with sorrow.After him is Memnon sitting on a stone; and close byhim is Sarpedon leaning with his face on both his hands.But one of the hands of Memnon is placed on the shoulderos Sarpedon. And all these have a beard. In the robeof Memnon too birds are painted: and these birds arecalled Memnonides. The inhabitants of Hellespont saythat these birds, on stated days every year, fly to the se­pulchre of Memnon, and dig up every part about the tombthat is void of trees and grafs, and afterwards sprinklesuch parts with their wings which are wet with the waterof the river Æsepus. Near Memnon there is a nakedÆthiopian boy, because Memnon was a king of theÆthiopians. However, he came to the Trojan •war, notfrom Æthiopia, but from Susa a Persian city, and theriver Choaspes; having vanquished all those nations whichare situated between Susa and the Choaspes. The Phry­gians too, even at present, shew a road through which heled his army at that time when he was selecting theshortest passages. This road is cut through desert places.Above Sarpedon and Memnon, Paris is painted, as yet abeardless youth. He is represented clapping his handsalter the manner of rustics; and you may conjecture, thatby this clapping he calls Penthesilea. Penthesilea too islooking at Paris; and by her countenance she appears todespise him, and to consider him as a man of no estima­tion. But the figure of Penthesilea is that of a virgin,

stadia, you will see a fountain, which is called the fountainof the horse. They say, that the horse of Bellerophonmade this fountain by striking the earth with his hoof.But the Bœotians that dwell about Helicon have a tradi­tion among them, that Hesiod wrote nothing besides thepoem entitled Works and Days; and from this they takeaway the introduction to the Muses, and fay that sheproper beginning of the poem is that part which speaksof Contentions. They shewed me too a leaden table nearthe fountain, which was almost entirely rotten throughage, but on which the Works and Days of Hesiod waswritten. Their opinion, however, who ascribe many worksto Hesiod, is very different from this. And, according to 1these, he composed a poem On Women; The Great Eoea *The Thtogony; Verses on the Prophet Melampus; The De­scent of Theseus with Pirithous to Hades; The Exhortation ofChiron, viz. relative to the instruclidti of Achilles; and thepoem called Works and Days.
The same persons too assert, that Hesiod was instructed'jn divination by the Acarnanes: and, indeed, a poem of He-Cod On Divination is extant, which I have read, together1with The Narrations of Prodigies, which are at the end of it.Contrary reports likewise are circulated about the deathof Hesiod. For though it is universally agreed, that thesons of Ganyctor, Ctimenus, and Antiphus, fled to Mo­lucca from Naupactus on account of the murder ofHesiod, and that through their impiety to Neptune theywere punished there, yet some are of opinion, that He­siod was falsely accused of having ravished the sister ofthese young men, and others assert, that she was ravishedby him. And such arc the different reports which arecirculated about Hesiod and his works. On the top ofF 4 mount

Page 301. Sprinkled with human Mood.] If we attend to thepre-existence of human fouls, and consider the crimes which theymay have committed in former periods of existence on the earth,and at the fame time consider that nothing escapes the pene­trating eye of providence, and that all its administrations are con-consummately just, the apparent cruelty in the injunction of thisoracle vanishes. For of what consequence is it whether a manwho deserves to die is flain before an altar, or put to death in acommon way? And we may be sure that no man is punished ei­ther with death or the loss of his possessions, or is in short op­pressed with any calamity, unjustly. For though the conduct ofsuch a one in that period of his existence in which he suffers may de­serve a milder destiny, yet it may be safely concluded that in somepast period of existence, it has been such as to demand the pu­nishment which he endures. It must however be observed, thatthis doctrine does not hold good with respect to truly worthymen, by which I mean those heroic souls of whom I have givenan account in a former note; for the calamities which befallothers, when they happen to these, are sent by divinity as purifi­cation*

Theyfay that it was thus denominated from Larymna, thedaughter of Cynus. But I (hall relate who were her moreremote ancestors, in my account of the Locrian affairs,formerly Larymna belonged to the city Opus: but whenthe power of the Thebans became very considerable, thenthe inhabitants of Larymna voluntarily joined themselvesto the Bœotians. There is a temple here of Bacchus,and a statue in an upright position. There is likewise alake, whose profundity commences from its very margin:and the mountains which are above the city afford wildboars for hunters.

On proceeding from Acræphnium, in a straight line tothe lake Cephiffis, which is called by some Copais, youwill arrive at a plain which is denominated Athamantios.They fay that Athamas dwelt in this place. The riverCephiffus pours itself into this lake. This river commencesfrom Lilæa among the Phocenscs, and affords a passagefor sliips to Copse, which is a small city situated near thelake, and which is mentioned by Homer in his catalogueof the sliips. In this city there are temples of Ceres,Bacchus, and Serapis. The Bœotians too fay, that for­merly other small cities, Athenx and Eleusis, were inha­bited near this lake, which were destroyed during the win­ter season by the overflowing of the lake.

either through the interference of some divine power, orby stratagem, as his naval forces were much superior tnthose of Theseus. This Bacchus, too, in my opinion, wasthe fame with the one who first led an army to the Indies,and first raised bridges over the Euphrates, in that partof the city which is called Zeugma, and where even atpresent a repe is preserved, made of vine and ivy twigs,which Bacchus is said to haye used when he built thebridges. Many things indeed are reported concerningBacchus, both by the Greeks and Egyptian*.
Under Phxdra Chloris reclines on the knees of Thyia.He who asserts that a great friendship subsisted betweenthese women, while living, will certainly not err. ThisChloris was a native of Orchomenus in Bceotia: and itis said by some that she married Neleus the son of Ncp-'tune, at that time when Neptune had connection withThyia. Procris the daughter of Erechtheus stands nearThyia : and after her you may fee Clymene", with her backtowards Thyia. In the poem called Nostpi, it is said tha^Clymene was the daughter of Minyas, and that.she wasmarried to Cephalus the son of Deion, by whom she hadIphiclus. Of Procris it is universally said, that before.Clymene she was married to Cephalus, and that she wasstain by her husband. In the more interior part of thepicture, after Clymene you may see the Theban Megara,•who was the wife of Hercules. She was however atlength dismissed by Hercules, in consequence of his beingdeprived of all the children which he had by her, and be-:lieving that his connection with- her was inauspicious.Above the heads of those women we have just mentioned,is the dajighter of Salmoneus sitting on a stone.

The reader mayfind the original of it in my translation of the Phædrus, page 52."The particulars which are reported about this Sibyl are so won­derful, that they liave the appearance of fables. But indeed therewere many Sibyls, all of whom adopted the fame life, and all ofthem, perhaps through a certain rational cause, were called Sibyls:just as Hermes Trifmegistus, who often resided in Egypt, is saidto have made mention of himself, and to have been called the thirdtime Hermes. Three Orpheuses also aie said to have existedamatig the Thracians. Perhaps therefore these Sibyls chosethese appellations from a certain communication and recollection;since this very Erythræan Sibyl, of whom Plato now speaks, wasfrom the first called Herophile. But they report that she calledevery one by his proper name as soon as she was born, that shelikewise spoke in verse, and that in a short time she arrived at"theperfection of the human species."

of a great name both in Greece and among the Bar*barians. Thus the Phrygians that dwell near the rivetPeucella, and who derive their origin from Arcadia andthe Azanes, shew those who travel to their country a ca­vern called Steunos. This cavern is round, and its alti­tude is accommodated to descent; and within it there isa temple of the mother of the gods, and a statue of thegoddess. Themisonium is a city above Laodicea, and itinhabited by the Phrygians: and when the army of theGauls spread all over Ionia and the neighbouring coasts,bringing with them destruction wherever they came, theThemisonians fay, that Hercules, Apollo, and Mercury,gave them assistance; and that the rulers of their country•were admonished by these divinities in a dream, to orderthe men, women, and children, to conceal themselves ina cavern belonging to this city. In remembrance of thiscircumstance, they have placed before the cavern statuesof a moderate size of Hercules, Mercury, and Apollo:and these statues they call Spela'iui.
This cavern is about thirty stadia distant from the town $and in it there are fountains of water: but there isnot any path which leads to it, nor does the light of thefun penetrate far into it. And besides this, the greatestpart of the roof is very near the ground* Among theMagnetx too who dwell near the river Lethæus, thereis a place called Hylæ: and in it there is a cavern sacredto Apollo, which for its magnitude does not demand muchadmiration; but the statue of Apollo within this cavernis very ancient, and imparts strength in overy undertak­ing.

nMONC the Thebans, near the gate Neitis, is thesepulchre of Menoeceus the son of Creon, who voluntarilyslew himself, in compliance with the Delphic oracle, whenPolynices came with an army from Argos. A pomegra­nate-tree grows near his tomb, the fruit of which, whenripe, on breaking the exterior rind, has the appearance ofblood. This tree regerminates perpetually. The Thebanstoo assert that the vine first made its appearance in theircountry; but they have not any token to shew of this atpresent. Not far from the sepulchre of Menoeceus, theylay that the sons of Oedipus, fighting in a single combat,slew each other. As a proof of this combat, there is apillar here, and upon it a stone shield.

But in the fifth Pythiad from this, they ran with coltsjoined to the car; and in this the sour colts of the ThebanOrphondas gained the victory. They instituted, however,many years after the Eleans, the pancratium among boys,the car drawn by two colts, and the vaulting horse: forthey instituted the pancratium in the sixty-first Pythiad,and in this the Theban Laidas was victorious: but onePythiad after this, they established the course with thevaulting colt; and in the sixty-ninth Pythiad, the cardrawn by two colts. And with the vaulting colt, indeed,the Larissæan Lycormas was victorious; but the Macedo­nian Ptolemy with the two-yoked car. For the Egyptiankings willingly suffered themselves to be called Macedo­nians, as indeed they were. But it appears to me, thatthe laurel crown was given as the reward of victory in thePythian games, for no other reason than because, accord­ing to report, Daphne the daughter os Ladon was belovedby Apollo.

As Hercules, therefore, was acharacter of this kind, it would be absurd to consider the pro­digies related of him as historical facts; but we should view themin the light of fables, under which certain divine truths are con­cealed. Indeed, to such as consider the accounts given of Her­cules as historical fists, we may very properly address the wordsof Plato to Dionylius, when he was interrogating him on thisvery subject, I mean the achievements of Hercules, "that if thethings reported of Hercules are true, he was neither the son ofJupiter, nor blessed, but on the contrary miserable: but if hewas the son of Jupiter and blessed, these accounts are false."* ccht.vc zs Js. roif Ta ToixJa fjL:§a.eia Xtyoicn, etxny o aTttxa&i) •• ?'. .Ta; hotvcriv iri^\ tov tj^aiiAeyj* oli a ftm Tavla a>.r,S»j isiv, a %tst aviavXt'/avtsit, b1e Jiio.- r,i, nit nicu^ui, a.},*.' a&XiO{" 11 ot ii.o; m *ai iviai-

the heavens: but they every where energize according to a pa­ternal and demiurgic mode, unfolding the one fabrication of theuniverse, and accommodating it to parts. But their allotmentand distribution are first according to the whole universe: and oneof these (Jupiter) produces the essences of things; but the second(Neptune), lives and generations; and the third (Pluto) admi­nisters the divisions of forms. And one of these establishes in theone demiurgus of the world every thing proceeding from thence;but the other evocates all things into progression: and the third,converts all things to himself. But their second distribution isinto the parts of the universe. For the first of these gods governsthe inerratic sphere, and its revolution. But the second presidesover the planetary spheres, and perfects their multiform, effica­cious, and prolific motions. And the last' of these gods governsthe sublunary region, and perfects intellectually the terrestrialworld. But in the third place, we may contemplate these threedemiurgic progressions in that which is generated. Jupiter there­fore governs the summit of generated natures, and the sphere offire and air: but Neptune excites with an all-various motion theextremely-mutable elements, and is the inspector and guardian ofever)- humid essence subsisting in air and water : and Pluto admi­nisters by his providence the earth, and all which it contains; andon this account he is called Terrestrial "Jupiter.
"In the fourth place, with respect to the whole of generation,Jupiter is allotted the most exalted places, in which, as Sorratesobserves in the Phædo, the regions detUned to blessed fouls arecontained ; because they live stparatc from gem ration, under thegovernment of Jove : but Neptune governs hollow places and ta­verns, in which generation, motion and concussions subsist; onwhich account he is called the carthJLaling god: nr,d Pluto go­verns places under the earth, the various streams of water, Tar­tarus, and the places in which fouls are judged.

dedicated by the Heracleotx near the Euxine sea, and theother by the Amphictyons from a sine which they leviedon the Phocenses for cultivating the land sacTed to thegod. This Apollo is called by the Delphi Sitalcas, and isthirty-five cubits in magnitude. Here too there are manystatues of commanders. There are besides statues of Dianaand Minerva, and two of Apollo, which were dedicatedby the Ætolians when they vanquished the Gauls. Pha-ennis, indeed, in her oracles, predicted that the army ofthe Celtæ would pass over from Europe into Asia, andprove the destruction of Asiatic cities, one age prior to theaccomplishment of her prediction: "Then, indeed, thepernicious army of the Celtæ, having passed over the nar­row sea of the Hellespont, shall play on the flute, and ina lawless manner depopulate Asia. ■ But divinity will stillmore severely afflict those that dwell near the sea. How­ever, in a short time after Jupiter will send them a de­fender, the beloved son of a Jove-nourished bull, who willbring destruction on all the Gauls."
Phaennis in this oracle means by the son of a bull, At­tains king of Pergamus, whom the oracle of Apollo calledTtmroleroos, or bull-horned. The generals of the horse,who are themselves seated on horseback, were dedicatedby the Phcrxi, for having vanquished the Athenian horse.But the Athenians dedicated the brazen palm, with thegilt st.ituc of Minerva, in consequence of having gainedin one and the same day a victory by land near Eury-medon, and by sea in the same river. When I saw thatthe gold was plucked from this statue in many places, Ithrew the blame on the sacrilegious; but I found after­wards in the account of the Attic affairs by Clitodemus,that, when the Athenians had prepared themselves for the

was lamented by every barbarous nation; and among theEgyptians there is a song which the Greeks call Linus:for this song is denominated by the Egyptians Manerem,But the Greeks, and among these Homer, mention thissong as Grecian. For Homer, being well acquainted withthe misfortune of Linus, fays that Vulcan represented,among other things, in the shield of Achilles, a boy play­ing on a harp, aiid singing the fate of Linus:
"To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,Whole fender ky the fate of Linus sings."
But Pamphus, who composed the most ancient hymns forthe Athenians, fays, that grief for the death of Linus in­creased to that degree, that he came to be called Oitolinos,or lamentable Linus. And afterwards the Lesbian Sappho,having learnt the name Oitolinos from the verses of Pam­phus, celebrates in her poems Adonis and Oitolinos. TheThebans too boast that Linus was buried in their coun­try; and they fay, that after the loss of the Greeks atChæronea, Philip the son of Amyntas, in consequence ofa vision in a dream, brought the bones of Linus to Mace­donia ; and afterwards, from another dream, carried backthe bones to Thebes. The covering however of this tomb,and every thing else belonging to it, have, they say, beenobliterated through length of time. The Thebans like­wise assert, that there was a junior Linus, the son os Isme-'nius; and that when but a boy he was slain by Hercules,whom he instructed in music. However, neither theLinus the son of Amphimarus, nor he who was the son ofIsmenius, composed any tlung in verse; or, if they did, ithas not been transmitted to posterity.

Even at present there are ruins, in the Trojan mount Ida,of the city Marpessus ; and it contains about sixty inhabit­ants. All the country about Marpessus is red, and verysultry. Hence it appears to me, that the reason why theriver Aidoneus, at one time hides itself in the earth,again emerges, and at last entirely disappears underground, is to be ascribed to the attenuated and cavernousnature of mount Ida. Marpessus is distant from theTrojan city Alexandrca about two hundred and fortystadia. The inhabitants of Alexandrea fay, that Herophilewas the guardian of the temple of Apollo, and that flicprophesied, in consequence of a dream of Hecuba, suchthings as I am very certain afterwards happened. ThisSibyl dwelt the greatest part of her life in Samos: shelikewise came to Delos and Delphos, in which last placeshe delivered her oracles on the stone which we havealready mentioned.
She died in Troy: her sepulchre is in the grove ofSminthcus: and on it there is a pillar with the followinginscription:
I who am buried in this stone sepulchreAm a Sibyl, a clear interpreter of the willOf Phoebus:
I was once a vocal virgin, but am now for ever dumb:And lie thus fettered, through the oppressive powerOf Fate.
I am however placed under the Nymphs and Mercury;And k is from Apollo that I receive thisDestiny, as the reward of iny ancientSacerdotal office.
Near her sepulchre there is a stone.Mercury of a quadran­gular figure; and on the left hand there is water runninginto a receptacle, and near it there are statues of Nymphs.

Page 57. Ar.d that Bacchus himself appeared as their leader.^The following Ptatonic dogma, which belongs to the greatestarcana of ancient Wisdom, solves all that appears to be so absurdend ridiculous to the atheistical and superficial in such-like histo­rical relations as the present. Every deity beginning from onhigh, produces his own proper series to the last of things; andthis series comprehends in itself mary essences differing from eachOther. Thus, for instance, the Sun produces Angelical, De­moniacal, Heroical, Nymphical, Panical, and such-like powers, eachof which subsists according to a solar characteristic: and the famereasoning must be applied to every other divinity. All thesepowers are the perpetual attendants of the Gcds, but they havenot all of them an essence wholly superior to man. For asteressential Heroes an order of souls follows, who proximately go­vern the affairs of men, and are dxmoniacal xxra axMl1i accordingto habitude or alliance, but not essentially. Of this kind are theNymphs that sympathize with waters, Pans with the feet ofgoats, and the like: and they d'sser from those powers that arcessentially of a dæmoniacal characteristic, in this, that they assumea variety of shapes (each of the others immutably preseiving oneform), are subject to various passions, and are the causes of all-various deception to mankind.

On proceedingfrom Copæ,on the left hand, at about the distance of twelvestadia, you will arrive at Holmones : and from Holmones,Hyettus is distant about seven stadia. These are now, asthey were at first, nothing more than villages; and it ap­pears to me that they are parts of the Orchomenian land,as well as the Athamantian plains. With respect toHyettus, and Holmus the son of Sisyphus, I (hall relatewhat I have heard concerning them, in my account ofthe Orchomenians.
But there is not any thing which deserves in the least tobe inspected among the Holmonians. In Hyettus thereis a temple of Hercules; and in it remedies are found forthe diseased. The statue, however, of Hercules is notartificially made, but is a rude stone after the ancientmanner. At about the distance of twenty stadia fromHyettus, is Crytones, They fay that this small city wasformerly called Cyrtone. It is built on a lofty mountain,and in it there are a temple and grove of Apollo. But inthe temple there are statues in an upright position os Apolloand Diana. Cold water flows here from a rock: and nearthis fountain there is a temple of the Nymphs, and a smallgrove in which trees of every kind are planted. On pro­ceeding from Crytones, after you have passed over themountain, you will arrive at the town Corsea. Underthis town there is a grove of planted trees, which are forthe most part scarlet oaks. A small statue os Mercurystands in that part of the grove which is in the open air.This grove too is about half a stadium distant from Corsea.On descending into the flat part of the country, you willsee the river Platanius pouring itself into the sea.

On the left hand of the gate which 16 called Electra,are the ruins of a house which they say was inhabited byAmphitryon when he fled from Tiryntha, on account ofthe death of Electryon. The bed-chamber of Alcmeneis yet to be seen among these ruins. They fay, that thisbed-chamber was built for Amphitryon by Trophoniusand Agamedes ; and that the following epigram was onceinscribed on it: Amphitryon, when he designed to marryAlcmene, chose this for his bed-chamber, which wasmade by Ancafius, Trophonius, and Agamedes. The The-bans, too, shew the sepulchre of the children of Hercule«by Megara: but the particulars which they relate con­cerning their death, do not in any respect correspond withthose given by Stesichorus Himereus and Panyasis in theirpoems. The Thebans farther add, that Hercules, throughhis insanity, would have slain Amphitryon himself, butthat before he could accomplish this he fell asleep throughthe blow of a stone; and that this stone was thrown byMinerva, whom they call Sophronijler, or tht restrainer. liithis place too there are images, of women on a pillar,whose form is obscured through age. These images theThebans call Pharmakides, or -witches; and they fay, thatthey were sent by Juno in order to prevent Alcmene frombeing delivered. However, Istoris the daughter ofTiresiasdeceived them while they were acting in this manner byAlcmene, by the following means; Fjom a place whenceshe could easily be heard by the witches, she cried out witha loud voice, that Alcmene was delivered; and in conse­quence

ThE race however of Halmus was destined to coma toan end. For Orchomenus did not leave behind him any*>children ; and in consequence of this, the royal authoritypassed to Clymenus the son of Presbon, and the grandson,of Phrixus. Erginus was the eldest son of this Clymenus jthe next to him in age were Stratius, Arrhon, and Pyleus \but the youngest of all was Axeus. Certain Thebans, fora very trifling offence, flew Clymenus during the cele­bration of the festival of Onchestian Neptune, this flightoffence having roused them to vehement wrath. Erginus,as being the eldest son of Clymenus, reigned after hisfather; and immediately as he came to the throne, havingwith the assistance of his brothers collected an army, ledhis forces against Thebes, vanquished the Thebans, andafterwards made a treaty of peace with them, On conditionthat they paid him an annual sum of money as a recom­pense for the murder of Clymenus. But when Herculesundertook to defend the Thebans, then the Thebans werefreed from this tribute, and the Minyæ suffered greatlyin war. Hence Erginus, who saw that his subjects werewearied in the extreme with the continuance of the war,made a peace with Hercules; and desirous that his king­dom might recover its pristine opulence and felicity, somuch neglected every thing else to accomplish this, thathe arrived at extreme old age without ever having been,married, or had any children.

On descending from the mountain Laphystion to thetemple of Minerva Itonia, you will see the river Phalarusrunning into the lake Cephiffis. Beyond the mountain La-phystion is Orchomenus, an illustrious and renowned Gre*cian city, which once arrived at the highest degree of feli­city, and which was destroyed by nearly the fame means atMycene and Delos. The following particulars are handeddown to us respecting its ancient affairs. They fay, thatAndreus the son of the river Peneus, first of all dwelt inthis place, and that from him the country was denominatedAndreis. That Athamas, becoming acquainted with him,gave him all the country about the mountain Laphystion,together with that region which is now called Coroneaand Haliartia. But Athamas, being of opinion that heIhould not leave any male children behind him (becausehe called to mind his conduct, when insane, towards Lear-chus and Melicerte, Leiicon had died through disease,and he was ignorant whether Phrixus was alive, or had anychildren), on this account he adopted Coronus and Ha-liartus, the sons of Thersander, who was the son of Sisy­phus: for Athamas-was the brother of Sisyphus. How­ever, when Phrixus, as some say, or Presbon, accordingto others, who was the son of Phrixus by the daughterof Ættes, returned from the Colchi, the sons of Ther­sander gave up the kingdom of Athamas to Athamas andhis progeny. These, therefore;, having received fromAthamas a pnrt of the land, built Haliartus and Coronea.But prior to the return of these, Evippe the daughter ofLcucon was given in marriage by Athamas to Andreus:and by her he had Eteoclcs; though it is reported by thecitizens, that Eteoclcs was the son of the river Cephisus.

In this engagement, however, many of the Phocensesfell, and among these Aleximachus, who in the vigour ofhis age, the strength of his body, and the ardour of hiszeal, surpassed all the Greeks. The Phoqenses afterwardssent his image to Apollo at Delphos. And such was theterror and slaughter to which the Gauls were exposed inthe day-time; but during the night they suffered stillmore severely. For the weather was vehemently cold,and this was accompanied with snow. Large stones, too,and fragments of rocks torn from Parnassus, fell on theBarbarians, as the destined mark at which they aimed.Nor was it only one or two that died by this means; butthirty, or still more, as they stood upon 'guard or slept inthe fame place, were at once dashed in pieces by the fall­ing rocks. As soon as it was day too the Greeks pouredout of Delphos: and of these some marched in a directline to the army of the enemy; but the Phocenses, asbeing better acquainted with the nature of the place, de­scended through the snow down the precipices of Parnas­sus, and, attacking the Gauls behind, pierced the Barba­rians with their darts and arrows in perfect security. Butwhen the two armies began to engage, the soldiers aboutBrcnnus, as they were the tallest and strongest of theGauls, vigorously resisted the Greeks; and though dartswere hurled at them on all sides, and they suffered greatlyby the cold, especially such as were'wounded, yet theystood their ground, till Brennus, through some woundswhich he had received, was carried out of the battle onthe point of expiring.
