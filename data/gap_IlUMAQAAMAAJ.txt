The same province, and, perhaps, the same city,which had given to the throne the virtues of Trajan,and the talents of Hadrian, was the original seat ofanother family of Spaniards, who, in a less fortunateage, possessed, near fourscore years, the decliningempire of Rome. They emerged from the obscurityof municipal honours by the active spirit of the elderTheodosius, a general, whose exploits in Britainand Africa have formed one of the most splendidparts of the annals of Valentinian. The son of thatgeneral, who likewise bore the name of Theodosius,was educated, by skilful preceptors, in the liberalstudies of youth; but he was instructed in the artof war by the tender care and severe discipline ofhis father. Under the standard of such a leader,young Theodosius sought glory and knowledge, inthe most distant scenes of military action; inured hisconstitution to.the difference of seasons and climates;distinguished his valour by sea and land; and ob­served the various warfare of the Scots, the Saxons,and the Moors. His own merit, and the recom­mendation of the conqueror of Africa, soon raisedhim to a separate command: and in the station ofDuke of Maesia, he vanquished an army of Sarma-tians; saved the province; deserved the love of thesoldiers; and provoked the envy of the court *.

Julian chap.had received the submission of two legions and a co- XVI1'hort of archers, who were stationed at Sirmium;but he suspected, with reason, the fidelity of thosetroops, which had been distinguished by the em­peror; and it was thought expedient, under the pre­tence of the exposed state of the Gallic frontier, todismiss them from the most important scene of ac­tion. They advanced, with reluctance, as far as theconfines of Italy; but as they dreaded the length ofthe way, and the savage fierceness of the Germans,they resolved, by the instigation of one of their tri­bunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to erect the bannersof Constantius on the walls of that impregnable city.The vigilance of Julian perceived at once the extentof the mischief, and the necessity of applying an im­mediate remedy. By his order, Jovinus led back apart of the army into Italy; and the siege of Aqui­leia was formed with diligence, and prosecuted withvigour. But the legionaries, who seemed to haverejected the yoke of discipline, conducted the de­fence of the place with skill and perseverance; in,rvited the rest of Italy to imitate the example of theircourage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat ofJulian, if he should be forced to yield to the supe­rior numbers of the armies of the East.

The person, as well as the mind, of Constantine chap.had been enriched by nature with her choicest en- XV'dowments. His stature was lofty, his countenance His virtues.majestic, his deportment graceful; his strength andactivity were displayed in every manly exercise, andfrom his earliest youth, to a very advanced season oflife, he preserved the vigour of his constitution by astrict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastityand temperance. He delighted in the social inter­course of familiar conversation; and though he mightsometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with lessreseijfre than was required by the severe dignity ofhis station, the courtesy and liberality of his man­ners gained ^the hearts of all who approached him.The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected;yet he showed, on some occasions, that he was notincapable of a warm and lasting attachment. Thedisadvantage of an illiterate education had not pre­vented him from forming a just estimate of the valueof learning; and the arts and sciences derived someencouragement from the munificent protection ofConstantine. In the despatch of business, his dili­gence was indefatigable; and the active powers ofhis mind were almost continually exercised in read­ing, writing, or meditating, in giving audience toambassadors, and in examining the complaints ofhis subjects. Even those who censured the proprietyof his measures were compelled to acknowledge, thathe possessed magnanimity to conceive, and patienceto execute, the most arduous designs, without beingchecked either by the prejudices of education, or bythe clamours of the multitude. In the field, he in­fused his own intrepid spirit into the troops, whomhe conducted with the talents of a consummate ge­neral; and to his abilities, rather than to his fortune,we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtainedover the foreign and domestic foes of the republic.

The subjects ofthe empire, who had so often experienced that theAlemanni could neither be subdued by arms norrestrained by treaties, might not promise themselvesany solid or lasting tranquillity: but they discovered,in the virtues of their young sovereign, the prospectof a long and auspicious reign. When the legionsclimbed the mountains, and scaled the fortifications,of the Barbarians, the valour of Gratian was distin­guished in the foremost ranks; and the gilt and va­riegated armour of his guards was pierced and shat- ,tered by the blows, which they had received in theirconstant attachment to the person of their sovereign.At the age of nineteen, the son of Valentinian seemedto possess the talents of peace and war; and his per-'sonal success against the Alemanni was interpretedas a sure presage of his Gothic triumphs *.

Theordinary speed of the Huns was checked by theweight of baggage, and the encumbrance of captives;but their military skill deceived, and almost de­stroyed, the army of Athanaric. While the judge ofthe Visigoths defended the banks of the Niester, hewas encompassed and attacked by a numerous detach­ment of cavalry, who, by the light of the moon,had passed the river in a fordable place; and it wasnot without the utmost efforts of courage and con­duct that he was able to effect his retreat towardsthe hilly country. The undaunted general had al­ready formed a new and judicious plan of defensivewar; and the strong lines, which he was preparing toconstruct between the mountains, the Pruth, and theDanube, would have secured the extensive and fertileterritory that bears the modern name of Walachiafrom the destructive inroads of the Huns.

The difficulty, as well as glory, ofthis enterprise, consisted in a laborious march; andJulian had conquered, as soon as he could penetrateinto a country, which former princes had consideredas inaccessible. After he had given peace to theBarbarians, the emperor carefully visited the forti­fications along the Rhine from Cleves to Basil; sur­veyed, with peculiar attention, the territories whichhe had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni,passed through Besan$on, which had severely sufferedfrom their fury, and fixed his head-quarters at Viennefor the ensuing winter. The barrier of Gaul wasimproved and strengthened with additional fortifica­tions; and Julian entertained some hopes, that theGermans, whom he had so often vanquished, might,in his absence, be restrained by the terror of his name.Vadomair was the only prince of the Alemanniwhom he esteemed or feared; and while the subtleBarbarian affected to observe the faith of treaties, theprogress of his arms threatened the state with anunseasonable and dangerous war.

The Caesar had rejected withabhorrence a mandate for the levy of an extraor­dinary tax; a new superdiction, which the prefecthad offered for his signature; and the faithful pic­ture of the public misery, by which he had beenobliged to justify his refusal, offended the court ofConstantius. We may enjoy the pleasure of readingthe sentiments of Julian, as he expresses them withwarmth and freedom in a letter to one of his most in­timate friends.

Could I abandon the"unhappy subjects intrusted to my care? Was I"not called upon to defend them from the repeated"injuries of these unfeeling robbers?

He restrained the impatientspirit of the Visigoths, till the injuries and the insultsof their tyrants should justify their resistance in theopinion of mankind: but he was not disposed tosacrifice any solid advantages for the empty praiseof justice and moderation. Sensible of the benefitswhich would result from the union of the Gothicpowers under the same standard, he secretly culti­vated the friendship of the Ostrogoths; and while heprofessed an implicit obedience to the orders of theRoman generals, he proceeded by slow marches to­wards Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower Maesia,about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube.On that fatal spot, the flames of discord and mutualhatred burst forth into a dreadful conflagration.Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendidentertainment; and their martial train remained underarms at the entrance of the palace.

The Quadi were much declinedfrom that formidable power, which, in the time ofMarcus Antoninus, had spread terror to the gates ofRome.

It was in vain that Constantine repeatedthe most dreadful menaces of fire and sword againstthe Borderers who should dare to desert their colours,to connive at the inroads of the Barbarians, or toparticipate in the spoil*. The mischiefs which flowfrom injudicious counsels are seldom removed by theapplication of partial severities: and though succeed­ing princes laboured to restore the strength andnumbers of the frontier garrisons, the empire, till thelast moment of its dissolution, continued to languishunder the mortal wound which had been so rashly orso weakly inflicted by the hand of Constantine.
The same timid policy, of dividing whatever is Reductionunited, of reducing whatever is eminent, of dreading iegi0n8.every active power, and of expecting that the mostfeeble will prove the most obedient, seems to pervadethe institutions of several princes, and particularlythose of Constantine. The martial pride of thelegions, whose victorious camps had so often been thescene of rebellion, was nourished by the memory oftheir past exploits, and the consciousness of theiractual strength.

But the active spirit of the He­ruli was subdued by the slow and steady perseveranceof the Goths; and, after a bloody action, in whichthe king was slain, the remains of that warlike tribebecame an useful accession to the camp of Hermanric.He then marched against the Venedi; unskilled inthe use of arms, and formidable only by their num­bers, which filled the wide extent of the plains ofmodern Poland. The victorious Goths, who werenot inferior in numbers, prevailed in the contest, bythe decisive advantages of exercise and discipline.After the submission of the Venedi, the conqueroradvanced, without resistance, as far as the confines ofthe Estii; an ancient people, whose name is still pre­served in the province of Esthonia.

A wiseprince should have rewarded the crime of Taurus:the faithful minister, when he was no longer able tooppose the progress of a rebel, had taken refuge inthe court of his benefactor and his lawful sovereign.But the guilt of Florentius justified the severityof the judges; and his escape served to display themagnanimity of Julian; who nobly checked the in­terested diligence of an informer, and refused to learnwhat place concealed the wretched fugitive from hisjust resentment*. Some months after the tribunalof Chalcedon had been dissolved, the prastorian vice­gerent of Africa, the notary Gaudentius, and Arte-mius duke of Egypt, were executed at Antioch.Artemius had reigned the cruel and corrupt tyrantof a great province; Gaudentius had long practisedthe arts of calumny against the innocent, the virtuous,and even the person of Julian himself.

in the study of the reign of Theodosius, we are re- chap.duced to illustrate the partial narrative of Zoshnus, xxxby the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles, bythe figurative style of poetry or panegyric, and bythe precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers.Conscious of these disadvantages, which will con­tinue to involve a considerable portion of the declineand fall of the Roman empire, I shall proceed withdoubtful and timorous steps. Yet I may boldly pro­nounce, that the battle of Hadrianople was never re­venged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodo­sius over the Barbarians; and the expressive silenceof his venal orators may be confirmed by the obser­vation of the condition and circumstances of thetimes. The fabric of a mighty state, which has beenreared by the labours of successive ages, could notbe overturned by the misfortune of a single day, ifthe fatal power of the imagination did not exaggeratethe real measure of the calamity. The loss of fortythousand Romans, who fell in the plains of Hadrian­ople, might have been soon recruited in the popu­lous provinces of the East, which contained so manymillions of inhabitants. The courage of a soldier isfound to be the. cheapest, and most common, qualityof human nature; and sufficient skill to encounteran undisciplined foe might have been speedily taughtby the care of the surviving centurions.

To his friends and soldiers, the philosophic heroappeared in a more amiable light; and his virtueswere never more conspicuously displayed than in thelast, and most active, period of his life. He practised,without effort, and almost without merit, the habitualqualities of temperance and sobriety. In the warmclimate of Assyria, a youthful conqueror preservedhis chastity pure and inviolate: nor was Julian evertempted, even by a motive of curiosity, to visit hisfemale captives. With the same firmness that heresisted, the allurements of love, he sustained thehardships of war. When the Romans marchedthrough the flat and flooded country, their sovereign,on foot, at the head of his legions, shared their fa­tigues, and animated their diligence. In every use­ful labour, the hand of Julian was prompt and stre­nuous; and the Imperial purple was wet and dirty,as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier. Thetwo sieges allowed him some remarkable opportuni­ties of signalizing his personal valour, which, in theimproved state of the military art, can seldom beexerted by a prudent general. The emperor stoodbefore the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his ex­treme danger, and encouraged his troops to burstopen the gates of iron, till he was almost overwhelmedunder a cloud of missile weapons, and huge stones,that were directed against his person.

Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage whichdisgraced the palace and table of the Roman emperor;and, as the impatient Goths could only be restrainedby the firm and temperate character of Theodosius;the public safety seemed to depend on the life andabilities of a single man *.

The sophists of every age, despising, oraffecting to despise, the accidental distinctions of .birth and fortune, reserve their esteem for the su­perior qualities of the mind, with which they them­selves are so plentifully endowed. Julian might dis­dain the acclamations of a venal court, who adoredthe Imperial purple; but he was deeply flattered bythe praise, the admonition, the freedom, and theenvy of an independent philosopher, who refused hisfavours, loved his person, celebrated his fame, andprotected his memory. The voluminous writings ofLibanius still exist; for the most part, they are thevain and idle compositions of an orator, who culti­vated the science of words; the productions of arecluse student, whose mind, regardless of his con­temporaries, was incessantly fixed on the Trojanwar, and the Athenian commonwealth. Yet thesophist of Antioch sometimes descended from thisimaginary elevation; he entertained a various andelaborate correspondence; he praised the virtues ofhis own times; he boldly arraigned the abuses ofpublic and private life; and he eloquently pleadedthe cause of Antioch against the just resentment ofJulian and Theodosius. It is the common calamityof old age, to lose whatever might have rendered itdesirable; but Libanius experienced the peculiarmisfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences,to which he had consecrated his genius. The friendof Julian was an indignant spectator of the triumphof Christianity; and his bigotry, which darkenedthe prospect of the visible world, did not inspire Li­banius with any lively hopes of celestial glory andhappiness.

Their contemplation of fancied triumphswas disturbed by the melancholy rumour of his death;and they persisted to doubt, after they could no longerdeny, the truth of that fatal event. The messengersof Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudentand necessary peace; the voice of fame, louder andmore sincere, revealed the disgrace of the emperor,and the conditions of the ignominious treaty. Theminds of the people were filled with astonishment andgrief, with indignation and terror, when they wereinformed, that the unworthy successor of Julian re­linquished the five provinces, which had been ac­quired by the victory of Galerius; and that heshamefully surrendered to the Barbarians the import­ant city of Nisibis, the firmest bulwark of the pro­vinces of the East. The deep and dangerous ques­tion, how far the public faith should be observed,when it becomes incompatible with the public safety,was freely agitated in popular conversation; and somehopes were entertained, that the emperor would re­deem his pusillanimous behaviour by a splendid actof patriotic perfidy. The inflexible spirit of the Ro­man senate had always disclaimed the unequal con­ditions which were extorted from the distress of hercaptive armies; and, if it were necessary to satisfythe national honour, by delivering the guilty generalinto the hands of the Barbarians, the greatest partof the subjects of Jovian would have cheerfully ac­quiesced in the precedent of ancient times.
But the emperor, whatever might be the limits ofhis constitutional authority, was the absolute masterof the laws and arms of the state; and the same mo­tives which had forced him to subscribe, now pressedhim to execute the treaty of peace.

If itcan be affirmed, with any degree of truth, that theluxury of the Romans was more shameless and dis­solute in the reign of Theodosius than in the age ofConstantine, perhaps, or of Augustus, the alterationcannot be ascribed to any beneficial improvements,which had gradually increased the stock of nationalriches. A long period of calamity or decay musthave checked the industry, and diminished the wealth,of the people; and their profuse luxury must havebeen the result of that indolent despair, which enjoysthe present hour, and declines the thoughts of fu­turity. The uncertain condition of their propertydiscouraged the subjects of Theodosius from engagingin those useful and laborious undertakings which re­quire an immediate expense, and promise a slow anddistant advantage. The frequent examples of ruinand desolation tempted them not to spare the remainsof a patrimony, which might, every hour, become theprey of the rapacious Goth. And the mad prodi­gality which prevails in the confusion of a shipwreck,or a siege, may serve to explain the progress of luxuryamidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation.

Of this work, which consisted of thirty-onebooks, only the last eighteen are now extant; butthese books contain a very circumstantial history oftwenty-five years; during which period Ammianuswas an eye-witness to the greater part of the trans­actions which he relates. Minute accuracy, and strict .veracity appear to be characteristics of this writer,whom Mr. Gibbon repeatedly calls his faithful guide.Though Ammianus is evidently desirous of placingthe character of Julian in as favourable a light aspossible, yet he does not allow his partiality for theemperor to induce him to deviate from that strictadherence to truth which is required of an historian.He mentions the hypocrisy of Julian in endeavouringto gain the favour of the Christians in Gaul, by join­ing with them in the celebration of the Epiphany,though he had already in secret abandoned their faith.And he relates the execution of Ursulus, though hecannot deny that it was an act of ingratitude, as wellas injustice, on the part of the emperor: the recitalof which will be displeasing to the favourers (fauto-ribus) of Julian. He describes very minutely theevents of the Persian expedition; yet he abstainsfrom any censure on the imprudence of his hero, inrejecting an offer of peace under the walls of Ctesi-phon, when he might have dictated the conditions ofthe treaty; instead of which, he led the Romans intosuch a situation, that, in a short time afterwards, thearmy could not be extricated without the most hu­miliating sacrifices.

The fame of Gratian, before he had accomplished chap.the twentieth year of his age, was equal to that of the XXILmost celebrated princes. His gentle and amiable dis- Characterposition endeared him to his private friends, the duct oTthegraceful affability of his manners engaged the affec-tion of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed a. d.379—the liberality, acknowledged the taste and eloquenceof their sovereign; his valour and dexterity in armswere equally applauded by the soldiers; and theclergy c6nsidered the humble piety of Gratian as thefirst and most useful of his virtues. The victory ofColmar had delivered the West from a formidableinvasion; and the grateful provinces of the Eastascribed the merits of Theodosius to the author ofhis greatness, and of the public safety. Gratian sur­vived those memorable events only four or five years;but he survived his reputation; and, before he fella victim to rebellion, he had lost, in a great mea­sure, the respect and confidence of the Romanworld.

The hopes of safety sub­dued the firmness of the Romans; the emperor wascompelled, by the advice of his council, and the criesof the soldiers, to embrace the offer of peace; andthe praefect Sallust was immediately sent, with thegeneral Arinthaeus, to understand the pleasure ofthe Great King. The crafty Persian delayed, undervarious pretences, the conclusion of the agreement;started difficulties, required explanations, suggestedexpedients, receded from his concessions, increasedhis demands, and wasted four days in the arts ofnegotiation, till he had consumed the stock of pro­visions which yet remained in the camp of the Ro­mans. Had Jovian been capable of executing a boldand prudent measure, he would have continued hismarch with unremitting diligence; the progress ofthe treaty would have suspended the attacks of theBarbarians; and, before the expiration of the fourthday, he might have safely reached the fruitful pro­vince of Corduene, at the distance only of one hun­dred miles. The irresolute emperor, instead ofbreaking through the toils of the enemy, expectedhis fate with patient resignation; and accepted thehumiliating conditions of peace, which it was nolonger in his power to refuse. The five provincesbeyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by thegrandfather of Sapor, were restored to the Persianmonarchy.

By this rash declaration of war, the impatienttemper of Gallus was provoked to embrace the mostdesperate counsels. He ordered his guards to standto their arms, assembled the populace of Antioch,and recommended to their zeal the care of his safetyand revenge. His commands were too fatally obeyed.They rudely seized the praefect and the quaestor, andtying their legs together with ropes, they draggedthem through the streets of the city, inflicted a thou­sand insults and a thousand wounds on these un­happy victims, and at last precipitated their mangledand lifeless bodies into the stream of the Orontes *.

The Persians, on every side, supportedtheir efforts, and animated their courage; and themonarch himself, careless of his rank and safety, dis­played, in the prosecution of the siege, the ardour ofa youthful soldier. After an obstinate combat, theBarbarians were repulsed; they incessantly returnedto the charge; they were again driven back with adreadful slaughter, and two rebel legions of Gauls,who had been banished into the East, signalized theirundisciplined courage by a nocturnal sally into theheart of the Persian camp.

infantry was invariably covered with defensive armour, chap.from the foundation of the city, to the reign of the XXILemperor Gratian. The relaxation of discipline, andthe disuse of exercise, rendered the soldiers less able,and less willing, to support the fatigues of the service;they complained of the weight of the armour, whichthey seldom wore; and they successively obtained thepermission of laying aside both their cuirasses andtheir helmets. The heavy weapons of their ancestors,the short sword, and the formidable pilum, which hadsubdued the world, insensibly dropped from theirfeeble hands. As the use of the shield is incom­patible with that of the bow, they reluctantly marchedinto the field; condemned to suffer, either the painof wounds, or the ignominy of flight, and always dis­posed to prefer the more shameful alternative. Thecavalry of the Goths, the Huns, and the Alani, hadfelt the benefits, and adopted the use, of defensivearmour; and as they excelled in the management ofmissile weapons, they easily overwhelmed the nakedand trembling legions, whose heads and breasts wereexposed, without defence, to the arrows of the Bar­barians. The loss of armies, the destruction of cities,and the dishonour of the Roman name, ineffectuallysolicited the successors of Gratian to restore the hel­mets and cuirasses of the infantry. The enervatedsoldiers abandoned their own, and the public de­fence; and their pusillanimous indolence may beconsidered as the immediate cause of the downfal ofthe empire*.

The fall of paganism, which, with one short interval, had been progressivefrom the time of Constantine, was rendered complete during the reign of Theo-dosius. The worship of Jupiter was condemned at Rome in the year 388, bythe decree of a very large majority of the senate: and the worship of idols, with

When thetyrant Caligula was suspected of an intention toinvest a very extraordinary candidate with the con­sular robes, the sacrilegious profanation would havescarcely excited less astonishment, if, instead of ahorse, the noblest chieftain of Germany or Britainhad been the object of his choice. The revolutionof three centuries had produced so remarkable achange in the prejudices of the people, that, with thepublic approbation, Constantine showed his successorsthe example of bestowing the honours of the consul­ship on the Barbarians, who, by their merit and ser­vices, had deserved to be ranked among the first ofthe Romans. But as these hardy veterans, who hadbeen educated in the ignorance or contempt of thelaws, were incapable of exercising any civil offices^the powers of the human mind were contracted bythe irreconcileable separation of talents as well as ofprofessions. The accomplished citizens of the Greekand Roman republics, whose characters could adaptthemselves to the bar, the senate, the camp, or theschools, had learned to write, to speak, and to actwith the same spirit, and with equal abilities.

The accumulated treasures found in xv.the palaces of Maxentius and Licinius were lavishlyconsumed; the various innovations introduced bythe conqueror were attended with an increasing ex­pense; the cost of his buildings, his court, and hisfestivals, required an immediate and plentiful sup­ply; and the oppression of the people was the onlyfund which could support the magnificence of thesovereign. His unworthy favourites, enriched bythe boundless liberality of their master, usurped withimpunity the privilege of rapine and corruption. Asecret but universal decay was felt in every part ofthe public administration, and the emperor himself,though he still retained the obedience, graduallylost the esteem, of his subjects. The dress and man­ners, which, towards the decline of life, he choseto affect, served only to degrade him in the eyesof mankind. The Asiatic pomp, which had beenadopted by the pride of Diocletian, assumed an airof softness and effeminacy in the person of Constan-tine. He is represented with false hair of variouscolours laboriously arranged by the skilful artists ofthe times; a diadem of a new and more expensivefashion; a profusion of gems and pearls, of collarsand bracelets, and a variegated flowing robe of silk,most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold. Insuch apparel, scarcely to be excused by the youthand folly of Elagabalus, we are at a loss to discoverthe wisdom of an aged monarch, and the simplicityof a Roman veteran. A mind thus relaxed byprosperity and indulgence was incapable of risingto that magnanimity which disdains suspicion, anddares to forgive.

In the meanwhile, Valentinian was alarmed andperplexed, by the doubtful intelligence of the revoltof the East. The difficulties of a German war forcedhim to confine his immediate care to the safety of hisown dominions; and, as every channel of communi­cation was stopt or corrupted, he listened, with doubt­ful anxiety, to the rumours which were industriouslyspread, that the defeat and death of Valens had leftProcopius sole master of the eastern provinces. Va­lens was not dead: but, on the news of the rebellion,which he received at Caesarea, he basely despairedof his life and fortune; proposed to negotiate withthe usurper, and discovered his secret inclination toabdicate the Imperial purple. The timid monarchwas saved from disgrace and ruin by the firmness ofhis ministers, and their abilities soon decided in hisfavour the event of the civil war. In a season oftranquillity, Sallust had resigned without a murmur;but as soon as the public safety was attacked, heambitiously solicited the pre-eminence of toil anddanger; and the restoration of that virtuous mini­ster to the praefecture of the East was the first stepwhich indicated the repentance of Valens, and satis­fied the minds of the people. The reign of Proco­pius was apparently supported by powerful armies,and obedient provinces. But many of the principalofficers, military as well as civil, had been urged,either by motives of duty or interest, to withdrawthemselves from the guilty scene; or to watch themoment of betraying, and deserting, the cause ofthe usurper.

The haughty and threatening style ofthe Imperial mandates awakened the secret indig­nation of a prince, who, in the humiliating state ofdependence, was still conscious of his royal descentfrom the Arsacides, the lords of the East, and therivals of the Roman power.
The military dispositions of Julian were skilfully Militarycontrived to deceive the spies, and to divert the at- tions.tention of Sapor. The legions appeared to directtheir march towards Nisibis and the Tigris. On asudden they wheeled to the right; traversed thelevel and naked plain of Carrhae; and reached, onthe third day, the banks of the Euphrates, wherethe strong town of Nicephorium, or Callinicum, hadbeen founded by the Macedonian kings. Fromthence the emperor pursued his march, above ninetymiles, along the winding stream of the Euphrates,till, at length, about one month after his departurefrom Antioch, he discovered the towers of Circesium,the extreme limit of the Roman dominions. Thearmy of Julian, the most numerous that any of theCaesars had ever led against Persia, consisted ofsixty-five thousand effective and well-disciplined sol­diers. The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry,of Romans and Barbarians, had been selected fromthe different provinces; and a just pre-eminence ofloyalty and valour was claimed by the hardy Gauls,who guarded the throne and person of their belovedprince.

Inthe exercise of his various functions, so essentiallyconnected with the whole system of civil government,he acquired the confidence of a monarch, who soondiscovered his diligence and capacity in business, andwho long remained ignorant of the pride, the malice,and the covetousness of his disposition. These viceswere concealed beneath the mask of profound dissi­mulation; his passions were subservient only to thepassions of his master; yet, in the horrid massacre ofThe"ssalonica, the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury,without imitating the repentance, of Theodosius.The minister, who viewed with proud indifferencethe rest of mankind, never forgave the appearance ofan injury; and his personal enemies had forfeited inhis opinion the merit of all public services. Promotus,the master-general of the infantry, had saved the em­pire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths; but heindignantly supported the pre-eminence of a rival,whose character and profession he despised; and, inthe midst of a public council, the impatient soldierwas provoked to chastise with a blow the indecentpride of the favourite. This act of violence was re­presented to the emperor as an insult, which it wasincumbent on his dignity to resent. The disgraceand exile of Promotus were signified by a peremptoryorder to repair, without delay, to a military stationon the banks of the Danube; and the death of thatgeneral (though he was slain in a skirmish with theBarbarians) was imputed to the perfidious arts ofRufinus*.

He obtainedthe formidable aid of the Taifalae, whose military re­nown was disgraced and polluted by the public in­famy of their domestic manners.

Soon after the reign of Augustus, they obligedthe Dacians, who subsisted by fishing on the banks (of the river Teyss or Tibiscus, to retire into the hillycountry, and to abandon to the victorious Sarmatiansthe fertile plains of the Upper Hungary, which arebounded by the course of the Danube and the semi­circular inclosure of the Carpathian mountains. Inthis advantageous position, they watched or sus­pended the moment of attack, as they were provokedby injuries or appeased by presents; they graduallyacquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons;and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate theirname by any memorable exploits, they occasionallyassisted their eastern and western neighbours, theGoths and the Germans, with a formidable body ofcavalry. They lived under the irregular aristocracyof their chieftains; but after they had received intotheir bosom the fugitive Vandals, who yielded to thepressure of the Gothic power, they seem to havechosen a king from that nation, and from the illus­trious race of the Astingi, who had formerly dwelton the shores of the northern ocean.
This motive of enmity must have inflamed theTheGothicsubjects of contention, which perpetually arise on the a.d. 351.confines of warlike and independent nations.

In the unsuspicious moment of a Christiana. d. 368. festival, Rando, a bold and artful chieftain, who hadlong meditated his attempt, suddenly passed theRhine; entered the defenceless town, and retiredwith a multitude of captives of either sex. Valen­tinian resolved to execute severe vengeance on thewhole body of the nation. Count Sebastian, withthe bands of Italy and Illyricum, was ordered to in­vade their country, most probably on the side ofRhaetia. The emperor in person, accompanied byhis son Gratian, passed the Rhine at the head of aformidable army, which was supported on both flanksby Jovinus and Severus, the two masters-general ofthe cavalry and infantry of the West. The Ale­manni, unable to prevent the devastation of theirvillages, fixed their camp on a lofty, and almost in­accessible, mountain, in the modern duchy of Wir-temberg, and resolutely expected the approach ofthe Romans. The life of Valentinian was exposedto imminent danger, by the intrepid curiosity withwhich he persisted to explore some secret and un­guarded path. A troop of Barbarians suddenly rosefrom their ambuscade; and the emperor, who vigor­ously spurred his horse down a steep and slipperydescent, was obliged to leave behind him his armour-bearer, and his helmet, magnificently enriched withgold and precious stones.

He considered,with a mixture of indignation and fear, the victoryof an aspiring eunuch, who had secretly captivatedthe favour of his sovereign; and the disgrace of hisdaughter, whose interest was inseparably connectedwith his own, wounded the tenderness, or at leastthe pride, of Rufinus. At the moment when he flat­tered himself that he should become the father of aline of kings, a foreign maid, who had been educatedin the house of his implacable enemies, was intro­duced into the Imperial bed; and Eudoxia soon dis­played a superiority of sense and spirit, to improvethe ascendant which her beauty must acquire overthe mind of a fond and youthful husband.

In the presence of this formidable assembly,the two emperors were called upon to explain thesituation of public affairs: the precedency of rankwas yielded to the royal birth of Constantius; andthough he was indifferently skilled in the arts ofrhetoric, he acquitted himself, under these difficultcircumstances, with firmness, dexterity, and elo­quence. The first part of his oration seemed to bepointed only against the tyrant of Gaul; but whilehe tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans,he insinuated, that none, except a brother, could claima right to the succession of his brother. He dis­played, with some complacency, the glories of his Im­perial race; and recalled to the memory of thetroops, the valour, the triumphs, the liberality of thegreat Constantine, to whose sons they had engagedtheir allegiance by an oath of fidelity, which the in­gratitude of his most favoured servants had temptedthem to violate. The officers, who surrounded thetribunal, and were instructed to act their parts in thisextraordinary scene, confessed the irresistible powerof reason and eloquence, by saluting the emperorConstantius as their lawful sovereign.

As soon as they possessed a more equalfield, Julian, who with his light infantry had led theattack, darted through the ranks a skilful and ex­perienced eye: his bravest soldiers, according to theprecepts of Homer, were distributed in the front andrear; and all the trumpets of the Imperial armysounded to battle. The Romans, after sending upa military shout, advanced in measured steps to theanimating notes of martial music; launched theirformidable javelins; and rushed forwards with drawnswords, to deprive the Barbarians, by a closer onset,of the advantage of their missile weapons. Thewhole engagement lasted above twelve hours; tillthe gradual retreat of the Persians was changed intoa disorderly flight, of which the shameful examplewas given by the principal leaders, and the Surenashimself. They were pursued to the gates of Ctesi-phon; and the conquerors might have entered thedismayed city, if their general, Victor, who was dan­gerously wounded with an arrrow, had not conjuredthem to desist from a rash attempt, which must befatal, if it were not successful. On their side, theRomans acknowledged the loss of only seventy-fivemen; while they affirmed, that the Barbarians hadleft on the field of battle two thousand five hundred,or even six thousand, of their bravest soldiers. Thespoil was such as might be expected from the richesand luxury of an oriental camp; large quantities ofsilver andgold, splendid arms and trappings, and bedsand tables of massy silver. The victorious emperordistributed, as the rewards of valour, some honourablegifts, civic, and mural, and naval, crowns; which he,and perhaps he alone, esteemed more precious thanthe wealth of Asia.

Although they werestrongly actuated by the allurements of rapine, theyprofessed a disinterested love of war, which theyconsidered as the supreme honour and felicity ofhuman nature; and their minds and bodies were socompletely hardened by perpetual action, that, ac­cording to the lively expression of an orator, thesnows of winter were as pleasant to them as theflowers of spring. In the month of December, whichfollowed the battle of Strasburgh, Julian attacked abody of six hundred Franks, who had thrown them­selves into two castles on the Meuse. In the midstof that severe season they sustained, with inflexibleconstancy, a siege of fifty-four days; till at length,exhausted by hunger, and satisfied that the vigilanceof the enemy in breaking the ice of the river leftthem no hopes of escape, the Franks consented, forthe first time, to dispense with the ancient law whichcommanded them to conquer or to die. The Caesarimmediately sent his captives to the court of Con-stantius, who accepting them as a valuable present,rejoiced in the opportunity of adding so many heroesto the choicest troops of his domestic guards. Theobstinate resistance of this handful of Franks ap­prised Julian of the difficulties of the expeditionwhich he meditated for the ensuing spring, againstthe whole body of the nation. His rapid diligencesurprised and astonished the active Barbarians. Or­dering his soldiers to provide themselves with biscuitfor twenty days, he suddenly pitched his camp nearTongres, while the enemy still supposed him in hiswinter quarters of Paris, expecting the slow arrivalof his convoys from Aquitain.

They immediately exer­cised an act of jurisdiction, by the manumission of aslave, who was brought before them for that pur­pose; and the ceremony was intended to representthe celebrated action of the elder Brutus, the authorof liberty and of the consulship, when he admittedamong his fellow-citizens the faithful Vindex, whohad revealed the conspiracy of the Tarquins.

Residence of Julian at Antioch.—His successful Expeditionagainst the Persians. — Passage of the Tigris.— TheRetreat and Death of Julian.— Election of Jovian.—He saves the Roman Army by a disgraceful Treaty.
The philosophical fable which Julian composed CHj^p,under the name of the Caesars, is one of the most'agreeable and instructive productions of ancient J/j,^^318wit. During the freedom and equality of the daysof the Saturnalia, Romulus prepared a feast forthe deities of Olympus, who had adopted him as aworthy associate, and for the Roman princes, whohad reigned over his martial people, and the van­quished nations of the earth. The immortals wereplaced in just order on their thrones of state, andthe table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon,in the upper region of the air. The tyrants, whowould have disgraced the society of gods and men,were thrown .headlong, by the inexorable Nemesis,into the Tartarean abyss. The rest of the Caesarssuccessively advanced to their seats; and, as theypassed, the vices, the defects, the blemishes of theirrespective characters, were maliciously noticed byold Silenus, a laughing moralist, who disguised thewisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a Bac­chanal *. As soon as the feast was ended, the voiceof Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter, that acelestial crown should be the reward of superiormerit. Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, and Mar­cus Antoninus, were selected as the most illustriouscandidates; the effeminate Constantine t was not

had extorted from the gods a seeming consent to hisown wishes, and those of the emperor. The journeyof Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed thetriumph of philosophic vanity; and the magistratesvied with each other in the honourable receptionwhich they prepared for the friend of their sovereign.Julian was pronouncing an oration before the senate,when he was informed of the arrival of Maximus.The emperor immediately interrupted his discourse,advanced to meet him, and, after a tender embrace,conducted him by the hand into the midst of theassembly; where he publicly acknowledged the be­nefits which he had derived from the instructions ofthe philosopher. Maximus *, who soon acquired theconfidence, and influenced the councils, of Julian,was insensibly corrupted by the temptations of acourt. His dress became more splendid, his de­meanour more lofty, and he was exposed, under asucceeding reign, to a disgraceful inquiry into themeans by which the disciple of Plato had accumu­lated, in the short duration of his favour, a veryscandalous proportion of wealth. Of the other phi­losophers and sophists, who were invited to the Im­perial residence by the choice of Julian, or by thesuccess of Maximus, few were able to preserve theirinnocence, or their reputation. The liberal gifts ofmoney, lands, and houses, were insufficient to satiatetheir rapacious avarice; and the indignation of thepeople was justly excited by the remembrance oftheir abject poverty and disinterested professions.The penetration of Julian could not always be de­ceived: but he was unwilling to despise the charac­ters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem;

The emperor subscribed with his own chap.hand, and in purple ink, the solemn edict, or in- XIV*diction, which was fixed up in the principal cityof each diocese, during two months previous to thefirst day of September. And, by a very easy con­nexion of ideas, the word indiction was transferred tothe measure of tribute which it prescribed, and tothe annual term which it allowed for the payment.This general estimate of the supplies was propor­tioned to the real and imaginary wants of the state;but as often as the expense exceeded the revenue, orthe revenue fell short of the computation, an addi­tional tax, under the name of superindiction, wasimposed on the people, and the most valuable attri­bute of sovereignty was communicated to the Prae­torian praefects, who, on some occasions, were per­mitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraor­dinary exigencies of the public service. The execu­tion of these laws (which it would be tedious to pur­sue in their minute and intricate detail) consisted oftwo distinct operations; the resolving the generalimposition into its constituent parts, which were as­sessed on the provinces, the cities, and the indivi­duals of the Roman world; and the collecting theseparate contributions of the individuals, the cities,and the provinces, till the accumulated sums werepoured into the Imperial treasuries. But as the ac­count between the monarch and the subject was per­petually open, and as the renewal of the demand an­ticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding obli­gation, the weighty machine of the finances wasmoved by the same hands round the cirele of itsyearly revolution.

The Moorish guards of thetyrant had been massacred in the first heat of thevictory; and a small number of the most obnoxiouscriminals suffered the punishment of the law. Butthe emperor showed himself much more attentive torelieve the innocent than to chastise the guilty. Theoppressed subjects of the West, who would have deemedthemselves happy in the restoration of their lands,were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalentto their losses; and the liberality of the conquerorsupported the aged mother, and educated the orphandaughters, of Maximus *. A character thus accom­plished might almost excuse the extravagant sup­position of the orator Pacatus, that if the elder Bru­tus could be permitted to revisit the earth, the sternrepublican would abjure, at the feet of Theodosius,his hatred of kings; and ingenuously confess, thatsuch a monarch was the most faithful guardian of thehappiness and dignity of the Roman people t.
Yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic Faultsmust have discerned two essential imperfections, which dosl!*?0might, perhaps, have abated his recent love of despot­ism. The virtuous mind of Theodosius was often re­laxed by indolence, and it was sometimes inflamed bypassion. In the pursuit of an important object, hisactive courage was capable of the most vigorous exer­tions; but as soon as the design was accomplished,or the danger was surmounted, the hero sunk intoinglorious repose; and, forgetful that the time of aprince is the property of his people, resigned himselfto the enjoyment of the innocent, but trifling, plea­sures of a luxurious court.

TheLimigantes obeyed with reluctance; but before theycould reach, at least before they could occupy, theirdestined habitations, they returned to the banks ofthe Danube, exaggerating the hardships of theirsituation, and requesting, with fervent professionsof fidelity, that the emperor would grant them anundisturbed settlement within the limits of the Ro­man provinces. Instead of consulting his own ex­perience of their incurable perfidy, Constantius list­ened to his flatterers, who were ready to representthe honour and advantage of accepting a colony ofsoldiers, at a time when it was much easier to obtainthe pecuniary contributions, than the military serviceof the subjects of the empire. The Limigantes werepermitted to pass the Danube; and the emperorgave audience to the multitude in a large plain nearthe modern city of Buda. They surrounded thetribunal,' and seemed to hear with respect an orationfull of mildness and dignity; when one of the Bar­barians, casting his shoe into the air, exclaimed witha loud voice, Marha!

Theyrushed with fury to seize the person of the emperor;his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged bythese rude hands; but the faithful defence of hisguards, who died at his feet, allowed him a momentto mount a fleet horse, and to escape from the con­fusion.

But they soon repented of theirown rashness. They were confounded by the re­proaches and threats of the Persian monarch. Theyfound reason to distrust the cruel and inconstanttemper of Para himself: who , sacrificed, to theslightest suspicions, the lives of his most faithful ser­vants; and held a secret and disgraceful correspond­ence with the assassin of his father, and the enemy ofhis country. Under the specious pretence of con­sulting with the emperor on the subject of their com­mon interest, Para was persuaded to descend from themountains of Armenia, where his party was in arms,and to trust his independence and safety to the dis­cretion of a perfidious court. The king of Armenia,for such he appeared in his own eyes and in those ofhis nation, was received with due honours by the go­vernors of the provinces through which he passed;but when he arrived at Tarsus in Cilicia, his progresswas stopped under various pretences; his motionswere watched with respectful vigilance, and he gra­dually discovered, that he was a prisoner in the handsof the Romans.

The latter, a crafty and cor­rupt statesman, declining to assume a responsiblepart on this dangerous occasion, eluded the pressingand repeated invitations of Julian, who representedto him, that in every important measure, the pre­sence of the praefect was indispensable in the councilof the prince. In the mean while the Caesar wasoppressed by the rude and importunate solicitationsof the Imperial messengers, who presumed to sug­gest, that if he expected the return of his ministers,he would charge himself with the guilt of the delay,and reserve for them the merit of the execution.Unable to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian ex­pressed, in the most serious terms, his wish, andeven his intention, of resigning the purple, whichhe could not preserve with honour, but which heCould not abdicate with safety.

The exploits ofthat general, the father of a line of emperors, havebeen celebrated, with peculiar complacency, by thewriters of the age: but his real merit deserved theirapplause; and his nomination was received, by thearmy and province, as a sure presage of approachingvictory. He seized the favourable moment of navi­gation, and securely landed the numerous and veteranbands of the Heruli and Batavians, the Jovians andthe Victors.

the first opportunity of regaining the affection of theircountrymen, and of signalizing their immortal hatredto the Persian name. Since the conversion of theArmenians and Iberians, those nations consideredthe Christians as the favourites, and the Magians asthe adversaries, of the Supreme Being; the influenceof the clergy over a superstitious people was uniformlyexerted in the cause of Rome; and as long as thesuccessors of Constantine disputed with those of Ar-taxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediate pro­vinces, the religious connexion always threw a de­cisive advantage into the scale of the empire. A nu­merous and active party acknowledged Para, the sonof Tiranus, as the lawful sovereign of Armenia; andhis title to the throne was deeply rooted in the here­ditary succession of five hundred years. By theunanimous consent of the Iberians, the country wasequally divided between the rival princes; and As-pacuras, who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor,was obliged to declare, that his regard for his chil­dren, who were detained as hostages by the tyrant,was the only consideration which prevented him fromopenly renouncing the alliance of Persia. The em­peror Valens, who respected the obligations of thetreaty, and who was apprehensive of involving theEast in a dangerous war, ventured, with slow andcautious measures, to support the Roman party in thekingdoms of Iberia and Armenia. Twelve legionsestablished the authority of Sauromaces on the banksof the Cyrus. The Euphrates was protected by thevalour of Arintheus. A powerful army, under thecommand of Count Trajan, and of Vadomair, kingof the Alemanni, fixed their camp on the confines ofArmenia.

Ten thou­sand of those auxiliaries, and Bacurius, general of theIberians, died bravely on the field of battle. But thevictory was not purchased by their blood: the Gaulsmaintained their advantage; and the approach ofnight protected the disorderly flight, or retreat, ofthe troops of Theodosius. The emperor retired tothe adjacent hills; where he passed a disconsolatenight, without sleep, without provisions, and withouthopes; except that strong assurance, which, underthe most desperate circumstances, the independentmind may derive from the contempt of fortune andof life. The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated bythe insolent and dissolute joy of his camp; whilst theactive and vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached aconsiderable body of troops to occupy the passes ofthe mountains, and to encompass the rear of theEastern army. The dawn of day discovered to theeyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity ofhis danger: but his apprehensions were soon dis­pelled, by a friendly message from the leaders ofthose troops, who expressed their inclination to desertthe standard of the tyrant.

They were encountered, onthe sacred threshold, by the archbishop, who, thun­dering against them a sentence of excommunication,asked them, in the tone of a father and a master,Whether it was to invade the house of God, that theyhad implored the hospitable protection of the repub­lic?

XIx'He despised the trophies of a Gothic victory, andwas satisfied that the rapacious Barbarians of theDanube would be restrained from any future viola­tion of the faith of treaties, by the terror of hisname, and the additional fortifications with whichhe strengthened the Thracian and Illyrian frontiers.The successor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the onlyrival whom he deemed worthy of his arms; and heresolved, by the final conquest of Persia, to chastisethe haughty nation, which had so long resisted andinsulted the majesty of Rome. As soon as the Per­sian monarch was informed that the throne of Con-stantius was filled by a prince of a very different cha­racter, he condescended to make some artful, orperhaps sincere, overtures, towards a negotiation ofpeace. But the pride of Sapor was astonished bythe firmness of Julian; who sternly declared, thathe would never consent to hold a peaceful conferenceamong the flames and ruins of the cities of Meso­potamia; and who added, with a smile of contempt,that it was needless to treat by ambassadors, as hehimself had determined to visit speedily the court ofPersia. The impatience of the emperor urged thediligence of the military preparations. The generalswere named; a formidable army was destined for thisimportant service; and Julian, marching from Con­stantinople through the provinces of Asia Minor, ar­rived at Antioch about eight months after the deathof his predecessor. His ardent desire to march intothe heart of Persia was checked by the indispensableduty of regulating the state of the empire; by hiszeal to revive the worship of the gods; and by theadvice of his wisest friends; who represented thenecessity of allowing the salutary interval of winter-quarters, to restore the exhausted strength of the

A motive of superstition pre­vented the execution of the design which Julian hadfrequently meditated, of relieving his head from theweight of a costly diadem: but he absolutely refusedthe title of Dominus, or Lord, a word which wasgrown so familiar to the ears of the Romans, thatthey no longer remembered its servile and humiliatingorigin. The office, or rather the name, of consul,was cherished by a prince who contemplated withreverence the ruins of the republic; and the samebehaviour which had been assumed by the prudenceof Augustus, was adopted by Julian from choice, anda.d.363. inclination. On the calends of January, at break ofJan' '* day, the new consuls, Mamertinus and Nevitta, has­tened to the palace to salute the emperor.

The emperor, on foot,marched before their litters; and the gazing multi­tude admired the image of ancient times, or secretlyblamed a conduct, which, in their eyes, degraded themajesty of the purple.

The discontent of the troops was producedby the malice of his enemies; their tumult was thenatural effect of interest and of passion; and if Julianhad tried to conceal a deep design under the appear­ances of chance, he must have employed the mostconsummate artifice without necessity, and probablywithout success. He solemnly declares, in the pre­sence of Jupiter, of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva,and of all the other deities, that till the close of theevening which preceded his elevation, he was utterlyignorant of the designs of the soldiers; and it mayseem ungenerous to distrust the honour of a hero,and the truth of a philosopher. Yet the superstitiousconfidence that Constantius was the enemy, and thathe himself was the favourite of the gods, mightprompt him to desire, to solicit, and even to hastenthe auspicious moment of his reign, which was pre­destined to restore the ancient religion of mankind.When Julian had received the intelligence of the con­spiracy, he resigned himself to a short slumber; andafterwards related to his friends, that he had seen theGenius of the empire waiting with some impatienceat his door, pressing for admittance, and reproachinghis want of spirit and ambition*.

Both were alikeimpatient to engage; but the Barbarians, after aslight resistance, fled in disorder; unable to resist,or desirous to weary, the strength of the heavylegions, who, fainting with heat and thirst, pursuedthem across the plain, and cut in pieces a line ofcavalry, clothed in complete armour, which had beenposted before the gates of the camp to protect theirretreat. Constantius, who was hurried along in thepursuit, attempted, without effect, to restrain theardour of his troops, by representing to them thedangers of the approaching night, and the certaintyof completing their success with the return of day.As they depended much more on their own valourthan on the experience or the abilities of their chief,they silenced by their clamours his timid remon­strances; and rushing with fury to the charge, filledup the ditch, broke down the rampart, and dispersedthemselves through the tents to recruit their ex­hausted strength, and to enjoy the rich harvest oftheir labours.

The confidence derived from the view oftheir own strength was increased by the intelligencewhich they received from a deserter, that the Caesar,with a feeble army of thirteen thousand men, oc­cupied a post about one-and-twenty miles from theircamp of Strasburgh. With this inadequate force,Julian resolved to seek and to encounter the Bar­barian host; and the chance of a general action waspreferred to the tedious and uncertain operation ofseparately engaging the dispersed parties of the Ale-manni. The Romans marched in close order, andin two columns, the cavalry on the right, the in­fantry on the left; and the day was so far spentwhen they appeared in sight of the enemy, thatJulian was desirous of deferring the battle till thenext morning, and of allowing his troops to recruittheir exhausted strength by the necessary refresh­ments of sleep and food. Yielding, however, withsome reluctance, to the clamours of the soldiers,and even to the opinion of his council, he exhortedthem to justify by their valour the eager impatience,which, in case of a defeat, would be universallybranded with the epithets of rashness and presump­tion. The trumpets sounded, the military shout washeard through the field, and the two armies rushedwith equal fury to the charge.

The Chamavians submissively retired totheir former habitations beyond the Rhine: but theSalians were permitted to possess their new esta­blishment of Toxandria, as the subjects and auxili­aries of the Roman empire. The treaty was ratifiedby solemn oaths; and perpetual inspectors were ap­pointed to reside among the Franks, with the au­thority of enforcing the strict observance of the con­ditions. An incident is related, interesting enoughin itself, and by no means repugnant to the cha­racter of Julian, who ingeniously contrived both theplot and the catastrophe of the tragedy. When theChamavians sued for peace, he required the son oftheir king, as the only hostage in whom he couldrely. A mournful silence, interrupted by tears andgroans, declared the sad perplexity of the Barba­rians; and their aged chief lamented in patheticlanguage, that his private loss was now embitteredby a sense of the public calamity. While the Cha­mavians lay prostrate at the foot of his throne, theroyal captive, whom they believed to have been slain,unexpectedly appeared before their eyes; and assoon as the tumult of joy was hushed into attention,the Ceesar addressed the assembly in the followingterms: "Behold the son, the prince, whom you"wept.

The pride assumed by Con- xv'stans, from the unmerited success of his arms, wasrendered more contemptible by his want of abilitiesand application. His fond partiality towards someGerman captives, distinguished only by the charmsof youth, was an object of scandal to the people; andMagnentius, an ambitious soldier, who was himselfof Barbarian extraction, was encouraged by the pub­lic discontent to assert the honour of the Romanname. The chosen bands of Jovians and Herculians,who acknowledged Magnentius as their leader, main­tained the most respectable and important station in,the Imperial camp. The friendship of Marcellinus,count of the sacred largesses, supplied with a liberalhand the means of seduction. The soldiers wereconvinced by the most specious arguments, that therepublic summoned them to break the bonds ofhereditary servitude; and, by the choice of an activeand vigilant prince, to reward the same virtues whichhad raised the ancestors of the degenerate Constansfrom a private condition to the throne of the world.As soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution,Marcellinus, under the pretence of celebrating hisson's birth-day, gave a splendid entertainment to theillustrious and honourable persons of the court ofGaul, which then resided in the city of Autun. Theintemperance of the feast was artfully protracted tilla very late hour of the night; and the unsuspectingguests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dan­gerous and guilty freedom of conversation.

The hasty and imprudentattack was" made by Bacurius the Iberian, who com­manded a body of archers and targeteers; and asthey advanced with rashness, they retreated with lossand disgrace. In the same moment, the flying squa­drons of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose return wasanxiously expected by the general of the Goths, de­scended like a whirlwind from the hills, swept acrossthe plain, and added new terrors to the tumultuous,but irresistible, charge of the Barbarian host.

The most skilfulmanf,evolutions, the firmest courage, are scarcely sufficientto extricate a body of foot, encompassed on an openplain by superior numbers of horse: but the troopsof Valens, oppressed by the weight of the enemy andtheir own fears, were crowded into a narrow space,where it was impossible for them to extend theirranks, or even to use, with effect, their swords andjavelins.

The power of sails or oars was insufficient;it became necessary to tow the ships against the cur­rent of the river; the strength of twenty thousandsoldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servilelabour; and if the Romans continued to march alongthe banks of the Tigris, they could only expect toreturn home without achieving any enterprise worthyof the genius or fortune of their leader. If, on thecontrary, it was advisable to advance into the inlandcountry, the destruction of the fleet and magazineswas the only measure which could save that valuableprize from the hands of the numerous and active troopswhich might suddenly be poured from the gates ofCtesiphon. Had the arms of Julian been victorious,we should now admire the conduct, as well as thecourage, of a hero, who, by depriving his soldiers ofthe hopes of a retreat, left them only the alternativeof death or conquest.

Notwith-. standing the positive testimony of several writers ofthe Pagan as well as of the Christian religion, theremay still remain some reason to believe, or at leastto suspect, that Fausta escaped the blind and suspi­cious cruelty of her husband.

Thepride of Constantius, and the ingenuity of his cour­tiers, were at a loss to discover any materials forpanegyric in the events of the Persian war; whilethe glory of his cousin Julian, to whose military com­mand he had intrusted the provinces of Gaul, wasproclaimed to the world in the simple and concisenarrative of his exploits.

They were strictly prohibited from inter­fering in any matter which related to the admini­stration of justice or the revenue; but the commandwhich they exercised over the troops of their de­partment was independent of the authority of themagistrates. About the same time that Constantinegave a legal sanction to the ecclesiastical order, heinstituted in the Roman empire the nice balance ofthe civil and the military powers. The emulation,and sometimes the discord, which reigned betweentwo professions of opposite interests and incompati­ble manners, was productive of beneficial and of per­nicious consequences. It was seldom to be expectedthat the general and the civil governor of a provinceshould either conspire for the disturbance, or shouldunite for the service of their country. While theone delayed to offer the assistance which the otherdisdained to solicit, the troops very frequently re­mained without orders or without supplies; thepublic safety was betrayed, and the defenceless sub­jects were left exposed to the fury of the Barbarians.The divided administration, which had been formedby Constantine, relaxed the vigour of the state,while it secured the tranquillity of the monarch.
The memory of Constantine has been deservedly °^enctioncensured for another innovation which corrupted troops.military discipline, and prepared the ruin of the em­pire.

The ambas­sador condescended to justify, or excuse, the conductof his master; and to protest, in specious language,that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated with­out his knowledge or consent, by the precipitate zealof the soldiers.

But the first and most seriouscare of Julian was to deliver his oppressed deity fromthe odious presence of the dead and living Christians,who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraudor enthusiasm. The scene of infection was purified,according to the forms of ancient rituals: the bodieswere decently removed; and the ministers of the ^e™^' ofchurch were permitted to convey the remains of St. bodies, andBabylas to their former habitation within the walls of ^ortheAntioch.

TheAlemanni, familiarized to the knowledge of thecountry, secretly collected their scattered forces, andseizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day,poured with unexpected fury on the rear-guard ofthe Romans.

The power ofthe enemy was yet unbroken; and the Caesar hadno sooner separated his troops and fixed his own mquarters at Sens, in the centre of Gaul, than he wassurrounded and besieged by a numerous host ofGermans.

The ela­borate work *, which he composed amidst the pre­parations of the Persian war, contained the substanceof those arguments which he had long revolved inhis mind.

But some re­mains of pride and prejudice still opposed the eleva­tion of Arbogastes himself; and the judicious Bar­barian thought it more advisable to reign under thename of some dependent Roman. He bestowed thepurple on the rhetorician Eugenius; whom he hadalready raised from the place of his domestic se­cretary, to the rank of master of the offices. In thecourse both of his private and public service, thecount had always approved the attachment and abili­ties of Eugenius; his learning and eloquence, sup­ported by the gravity of his manners, recommendedhim to the esteem of the people; and the reluctance,with which he seemed to ascend the throne, may in­spire a favourable prejudice of his virtue and mo­deration.

Basnage objects, that Sozomen does not name anyof these eye-witnesses, or the person who had derivedinformation from them. In reply to Basnage, it hasbeen said, that witnesses are seldom named if referenceis made to a multitude of persons who have viewedand related a public spectacle. He takes no noticeof the three contemporary writers, Ambrose, Chry-sostom, and Gregory Nazienzen; the last of whomwrote before the close of the year in which the occur­rences took place. But, what is still more extraordi­nary, Mr. Basnage makes no mention of AmmianusMarcellinus. He entirely overlooks this great paganhistorian, who relates with circumstantial minutenessthe events of the reign of Julian, to the greater partof which he was an eye-witness, and who certainly wasnot influenced by any partiality to the cause of Chris­tianity.
Bishop Warburton, in his Julian, an elaborate work,in reply to Basnage, has stated, if I mistake not, everything that can be adduced on this subject. He alsoquotes some expressions from an epistle of Julian, toprove that the emperor himself could not help ac­knowledging the truth of the occurrence.

Many opulent senators X1V'of Rome, and of the Eastern provinces, were probablyinvited by Constantine to adopt for their country thefortunate spot which he had chosen for his own re­sidence. The invitations of a master are scarcely tobe distinguished from commands; and the liberalityof the emperor obtained a ready and cheerful obedi­ence. He bestowed on his favourites the palaceswhich he had built in the several quarters of the city,assigned them lands and pensions for the support oftheir dignity, and alienated the demesnes of Pontusand Asia, to grant hereditary estates by the easytenure of maintaining a house in the capital.

The intelligence of his defeat and death wasreceived with sincere, or well-dissembled, joy: hisson Victor, on whom he had conferred the title ofAugustus, died by the order, perhaps by the hand,of the bold Arbogastes; and all the military plans ofTheodosius were successfully executed. When hehad thus terminated the civil war, with less difficulty.and bloodshed than he might naturally expect, heemployed the winter months of his residence at Milanto restore the state.of the afflicted provinces; andearly in the spring he made, after the example ofConstantine and Constantius, his triumphal entryinto the ancient capital of the Roman empire.

The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy maybe derived from the early period of his life, when hewas left an orphan in the hands of the murderers ofhis family. The names of Christ and of Constantius,the ideas of slavery and of religion, were soon asso­ciated in a youthful imagination, which was suscepti­ble of the most lively impressions. The care of hisinfancy was intrusted to Eusebius, the Arian bishopof Nicomedia, who was related to him on the side ofhis mother. He was educated in the Lesser Asia,amidst the scandals of the Arian controversy. Thefierce contests of the Eastern bishops, the incessantalterations of their creeds, and the profane motiveswhich appeared to actuate their conduct, insensiblystrengthened the prejudice of Julian, that they nei­ther understood nor believed the religion for whichthey so fiercely contended. Instead of listening tothe proofs of Christianity with that favourable atten­tion which adds weight to the most respectable evi­dence, he heard with suspicion, and disputed withobstinacy and acuteness, the doctrines for which healready entertained an invincible aversion.
The creed which Julian adopted for his own usewas of the largest dimensions; and, by a strangecontradiction, he disdained the salutary yoke of theGospel, whilst he made a voluntary offering of hisreason on the altars of Jupiter and Apollo. One ofthe orations of Julian is consecrated to the honour ofCybele, the mother of the gods, who required fromher effeminate priests the bloody sacrifice, so rashlyperformed by the madness of the Phrygian boy.

A bridge of boats wasestablished upon the Danube ; the presence of Valensanimated his troops; and his ignorance of the art ofwar was compensated by personal bravery, and a wisedeference to the advice of Victor and Arintheus, hismasters-general of the cavalry and infantry. Theoperations of the campaign were conducted by theirskill and experience; but they found it impossible todrive the Visigoths from their strong posts in themountains ; and the devastation of the plains obligedthe Romans themselves to repass the Danube on theapproach of winter. The incessant rains, whichswelled the waters of the river, produced a tacit sus­pension of arms, and confined the emperor Valens,during the whole course of the ensuing summer, tohis camp of Marcianapolis. The third year of thewar was more favourable to the Romans, and morepernicious to the Goths. The interruption of tradedeprived the Barbarians of the objects of luxury,which they already confounded with the necessariesof life; and the desolation of a very extensive tractof country threatened them with the horrors of fa­mine.

Thestory is related by several succeeding authors, withsome variations and additional circumstances, but, forthe most part, copying the three foregoing fathers.Of modern writers *, Basnage, in his Histoire desJuifs, endeavours to controvert the truth of the story,and the authority of the Christian authors; but heconfines his observations to Socrates, Sozomen, andTheodoret, who wrote at a somewhat later period.
Basnage urges the following objection to the testi­mony of Sozomen: That writer concludes his account
"Lardner expresses himself as follows: Julian, in the fragment of someoration or epistle, having taken notice how often the Jewish temple had beendestroyed, and was not yet restored, adds, "I say not this by way of reproach,"for I also have designed (or have had a design) to raise that temple which has"been so long in ruins to the honour of the God who is there worshipped." Inconsidering the passage in Ammianus, he expresses himself thus: "Great weight."was laid on the testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus. who was a heathen and an"impartial historian." But then it has been said by some, that he had this accountfrom the Christians, and took it up without examination. To which I would addthat he was credulous, as appears from many things in his history. He mighttherefore, without scruple, record a miraculous interposition which had been repeat,ed to him.

Hisgenuine character, which was composed of pride andweakness, of superstition and cruelty, has been fullydisplayed in the preceding narrative. The longabuse of power rendered him a considerable objectin the eyes of his contemporaries; but as personalmerit can alone deserve the notice of posterity, thelast of the sons of Constantine may be dismissed fromthe world with the remark, that he inherited thedefects, without the abilities, of his father. BeforeConstantius expired, he is said to have named Julianfor his successor; nor does it seem improbable, thathis anxious concern for the fate of a young andtender wife, whom he left with child, may have pre­vailed, in his last moments, over the harsher pas­sions of hatred and revenge. Eusebius, and hisguilty associates, made a faint attempt to prolongthe reign of the eunuchs, by the election of anotheremperor: but their intrigues were rejected with dis­dain by an army which now abhorred the thought ofcivil discord; and two officers of rank were instantlydespatched, to assure Julian, that every sword in theempire would be drawn for his service. The mili­tary designs of that prince, who had formed threedifferent attacks against Thrace, were prevented bythis fortunate event. Without shedding the bloodof his fellow-citizens, he escaped the dangers of adoubtful conflict, and acquired the advantages of acomplete victory. Impatient to visit the place of hisbirth, and the new capital of the empire, he ad­vanced from Naissus through the mountains of Hae-mus, and the cities of Thrace. When he reached

At this tremendous sentence thetroops fell prostrate on the ground, deprecated theindignation of their sovereign, and protested, that ifhe would indulge them in another trial, they wouldapprove themselves not unworthy of the name of Ro­mans, and of his soldiers. Valentinian, with affectedreluctance, yielded to their entreaties: the Bata­vians resumed their arms; and, with their arms, theinvincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace inthe blood of the Alemanni. The principal commandwas declined by Degalaiphus; and that experiencedgeneral, who had represented, perhaps with too muchprudence, the extreme difficulties of the undertaking,had the mortification, before the end of the cam­paign, of seeing his rival Jovinus convert those dif­ficulties into a decisive advantage over the scatteredforces of the Barbarians. At the head of a well-disciplined army of cavalry, infantry, and light troops,Jovinus advanced, with cautious and rapid steps, toScarponna, in the territory of Metz, where he sur­prised a large division of the Alemanni, before theyhad time to run to their arms; and flushed his sol­diers with the confidence of an easy and bloodlessvictory. Another division, or rather army, of theenemy, after the cruel and wanton devastation of theadjacent country, reposed themselves on the shadybanks of the Moselle. Jovinus, who had viewed theground with the eye of a general, made his silentapproach through a deep and woody vale, till hecould distinctly perceive the indolent security of theGermans.

The valour of the Goths was so ablydirected by the genius of Fritigern, that they broke,by a close and vigorous attack, the ranks of the Ro­man legions. Lupicinus left his arms and standards,his tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field ofbattle; and their useless courage served only to pro­tect the ignominious flight of their leader. "That"successful day put an end to the distress of the"Barbarians, and the security of the Romans: from"that day the Goths, renouncing the precarious con-"dition of strangers and exiles, assumed the charac-"ter of citizens and masters, claimed an absolute"dominion over the possessors of land, and held, in"their own right, the northern provinces of the em-"pire, which are bounded by the Danube." Suchare the words of the Gothic historian, who celebrates,with rude eloquence, the glory of his countrymen.But the dominion of the Barbarians was exercisedonly for the purposes of rapine and destruction. Asthey had been deprived, by the ministers of the em­peror, of the common benefits of nature, and the fairintercourse of social life, they retaliated the injusticeon the subjects of the empire; and the crimes ofThcypcnc- Lupicinus were expiated by the ruin of the peacefulThraoe!° husbandmen of Thrace, the conflagration of their vil-. lages, and the massacre, or captivity, of their inno­cent families.

The fugitives escaped to the third andmost considerable camp, in the Catalaunian plains,near Chalons in Champagne: the straggling detach­ments were hastily recalled to their standard; andthe Barbarian chiefs, alarmed and admonished bythe fate of their companions, prepared to encounter,in a decisive battle, the victorious forces of the lieu­tenant of Valentinian. The bloody and obstinate con­flict lasted a whole summer's day, with equal valour,and with alternate success. The Romans at lengthprevailed, with the loss of about twelve hundred men. .Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain, four thou­sand were wounded; and the brave Jovinus, afterchasing the flying remnant of their host as far as thebanks of the Rhine, returned to Paris, to receive theapplause of his sovereign, and the ensigns of theconsulship for the ensuing year*. The triumph of July.the Romans was indeed sullied by their treatment ofthe captive king, whom they hung on a gibbet with­out the knowledge of their indignant general. Thisdisgraceful act of cruelty, which might be imputedto the fury of the troops, was followed by the de­liberate murder of Withicab, the son of Vadomair;a German prince, of a weak and sickly constitution,but of a daring and formidable spirit.

The re­turns which were sent of every province or districtexpressed the number of tributary subjects, and theamount of the public impositions. The latter ofthese sums was divided by the former; and the esti­mate, that such a province contained so many capita,or heads of tribute, and that each head was ratedat such a price, was universally received, not onlyin the popular, but even in the legal computation.The value of a tributary head must have varied, ac­cording to many accidental, or at least fluctuatingcircumstances: but some knowledge has been pre­served of a very curious fact, the more important,since it relates to one of the richest provinces of theRoman empire, and which now flourishes as themost splendid of the European kingdoms. The ra­pacious ministers of Constantius had exhausted thewealth of Gaul, by exacting twenty-five pieces ofgold for the annual tribute of every head. The hu­mane policy of his successor reduced the capitationto seven pieces. A moderate proportion betweenthese opposite extremes of extravagant oppressionand of transient indulgence, may therefore be fixedat sixteen pieces of gold, or about nine pounds ster­ling, the common standard perhaps of the impositionsof Gaul *. But this calculation, or rather indeedthe facts from whence it is deduced, cannot fail ofsuggesting two difficulties to a thinking mind, who

Those among hispredecessors who had enjoyed the longest and mostprosperous reigns, Augustus, Trajan, and Diocletian,had been disappointed of posterity; and the frequentrevolutions had never allowed sufficient time for anyImperial family to grow up and multiply under theshade of the purple. But the royalty of the Flavianline, which had been first ennobled by the GothicClaudius, descended through several generations;and Constantine himself derived from his royal fatherthe hereditary honours which he transmitted to hischildren. The emperor had been twice married.Minervina, the obscure but lawful object of his youth­ful attachment, had left him only one son, who wascalled Crispus. By Fausta, the daughter of Maxi-mian, he had three daughters, and three sons, knownby the kindred names of Constantine, Constantius,and Constans. The unambitious brothers of thegreat Constantine, Julius Constantius, Dalmatius, andHannibalianus, were permitted to enjoy the mosthonourable rank, and the most affluent fortune, thatcould be consistent with a private station.

TheGermans possessed the superiority of strength andstature, the Romans that of discipline and temper;and as the Barbarians, who served under the stand­ard of the empire, united the respective advantagesof both parties, their strenuous efforts, guided by askilful leader, at length determined the event of theday. The Romans lost four tribunes, and two hun­dred and forty-three soldiers, in this memorable bat­tle of Strasburgh, so glorious to the Caesar, and sosalutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul. Sixthousand of the Alemanni were slain in the field,without including those who were drowned in theRhine, or transfixed with darts whilst they attemptedto swim across the river. Chnodomar himself wassurrounded and taken prisoner, with three of hisbrave companions, who devoted themselves to followin life or death the fate of their chieftain. Julianreceived him with military pomp in the council ofhis officers; and expressing a generous pity for thefallen state, dissembled his inward contempt for theabject humiliation of his captive. Instead of ex­hibiting the vanquished king of the Alemanni, as agrateful spectacle to the cities of Gaul, he respect­fully laid at the feet of the emperor this splendidtrophy of his victory. Chnodomar experienced anhonourable treatment, but the impatient Barbariancould not long survive his defeat, his confinement,and his exile *.

But as soon as theywere landed, he issued an absolute order, which pro­hibited the watermen from transporting any Egyp­tian to Constantinople; and thus detained his disap­pointed clients on the Asiatic shore, till their pa­tience and money being utterly exhausted, they wereobliged to return with indignant murmurs to theirnative country *.clemency of The numerous army of spies, of agents, and in-formers, mlisted by Constantius to secure the reposeof one man, and to interrupt that of millions, wasimmediately disbanded by his generous successor.Julian was slow in his suspicions, and gentle in hispunishments; and his contempt of treason was theresult of judgment, of vanity, and of courage. Con­scious of superior merit, he was persuaded that fewamong his subjects would dare to meet him in thefield, to attempt his life, or even to seat themselveson his vacant throne.

XXI' the military command was divided between Nanienusand Mellobaudes; and the youthful emperor, thoughhe respected the long experience and sober wisdomof the former, was much more inclined to admire,and to follow, the martial ardour of his colleague;who was allowed to unite the incompatible charactersof count of the domestics, and of king of the Franks.His rival Priarius, king of the Alemanni, was guided,or rather impelled, by the same headstrong valour;and as their troops were animated by the spirit oftheir leaders, they met, they saw, they encountered,each other, near the town of Argentaria, or Colmar,in the plains of Alsace. The glory of the day wasjustly ascribed to the missile weapons, and well-prac­tised evolutions, of the Roman soldiers: the Ale­manni, who long maintained their ground, wereslaughtered with unrelenting fury: five thousandonly of the Barbarians escaped to the woods andmountains; and the glorious death of their king, onthe field of battle, saved him from the reproaches ofthe people, who are always disposed to accuse thejustice, or policy, of an unsuccessful war. After thissignal victory, which secured the peace of Gaul, andasserted the honour of the Roman arms, the empe­ror Gratian appeared to proceed without delay onhis Eastern expedition; but as he approached theconfines of the Alemanni, he suddenly inclined tothe left, surprised them by his unexpected passage ofthe Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart oftheir country.

The \^arguments by which they solicited the concurrence ofthe soldiers and people are of a more obvious nature;and they might with decency, as well as truth, insiston the superior rank of the children of Constantine,the danger of multiplying the number of sovereigns,and the impending mischiefs which threatened therepublic, from the discord of so many rival princes,who were not connected by the tender sympathy offraternal affection. The intrigue was conducted withzeal and secrecy, till a loud and unanimous declara­tion was procured from the troops, that they wouldsuffer none except the sons of their lamented mon­arch to reign over the Roman empire. The youngerDalmatius, who was united with his collateral rela­tions by the ties of friendship and interest, is allowedto have inherited a considerable share of the abilitiesof the great Constantine: but, on this occasion, hedoes not appear to have concerted any measures forsupporting, by arms, the just claims which himselfand his royal brother derived from the liberality oftheir uncle. Astonished and overwhelmed by thetide of popular fury, they seem to have remained,without the power of flight or of resistance, in thehands of their implacable enemies.

But the le­gions of Vetranio were seduced rather than provokedby the example of rebellion; their leader soon be­trayed a want of firmness, or a want of sincerity; andhis ambition derived a specious pretence from theapprobation of the princess Constantina. That crueland aspiring woman, who had obtained from the greatConstantine her father the rank of Augusta, placedthe diadem with her own hands on the head of theIllyrian general; and seemed to expect from his vic­tory the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes,of which she had been disappointed by the death ofher husband Hannibalianus< Perhaps it was withoutthe consent of Constantiria, that the new emperorformed a necessary, though dishonourable, alliancewith the usurper of the west, whose purple was sorecently stained with her brother's blood.

Insensible to the voice offlattery, which assured him that his all-powerfulvirtue, and celestial fortune, would still continue totriumph over every obstacle, he listened with com­placency to the advice of Eusebia, which gratifiedhis indolence, without offending his suspicious pride.As she perceived that the remembrance of Gallusdwelt on the emperor's mind, she artfully turned hisattention to the opposite characters of the two bro­thers, which from their infancy had been comparedto those of Domitian and of Titus. She accustomedher husband to consider Julian as a youth of a mildunambitious disposition, whose allegiance and gra­titude might be secured by the gift of the purple,and who was qualified to fill, with honour, a sub­ordinate station, without aspiring to dispute the com­mands, or to shade the glories, of his sovereign andbenefactor. After an obstinate, though secret strug­gle, the opposition of the favourite eunuchs submittedto the ascendancy of the empress; and it was resolvedthat Julian, after celebrating his nuptials with He­lena, sister of Constantius, should be appointed, withthe title of Caesar, to reign over the countries beyondthe Alps *.

Before Valentinian divided the provinces, he re- Jh.e.finalfformed the administration of the empire. All ranks the easternof subjects, who had been injured or oppressed under empirrat6™the reign of Julian, were invited to support their 364,public accusations. The silence of mankind attestedthe spotless integrity of the praefect Sallust; and hisown pressing solicitations, that he might be permittedto retire from the business of the state, were rejectedby Valentinian with the most honourable expressionsof friendship and esteem. But among the favouritesof the late emperor, there were many who had abusedhis credulity or superstition; and who could no longerhope to be protected either by favour or justice. Thegreater part of the ministers of the. palace, and the go­vernors of the provinces, were removed from their re­spective stations; yet the eminent merit of someofficers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd;and, notwithstanding the opposite clamours of zeal andresentment, the whole proceedings of this delicateinquiry appear to have been conducted with a reason­able share of wisdom and moderation. The festivityof a new reign received a short and suspicious inter­ruption from the sudden illness of the two princes:but as soon as their health was restored, they leftConstantinople in the beginning of the spring. Inthe castle or palace of Mediana, only three miles fromNaissus, they executed the solemn and final divisionof the Roman empire. Valentinian bestowed on hisbrother the rich prefecture of the East, from the LowerDanube to the confines of Persia; whilst he reservedfor his immediate government the warlike prefecturesof Illyricum, Italy, and Gaul, from the extremity ofGreece to the Caledonian rampart; and from therampart of Caledonia to the foot of Mount Atlas.

Hisembassy fo moderate the zeal of his party, to protect thetius. persons of his enemies, to defeat and to despise thesecret enterprises which were formed against his lifeand dignity, were the cares which employed the firstdays of the reign of the new emperor. Although hewas firmly resolved to maintain the station which hehad assumed, he was still desirous of saving his coun­try from the calamities of civil war, of declining acontest with the superior forces of Constantius, andof preserving his own character from the reproach ofperfidy and ingratitude. Adorned with the ensignsof military and Imperial pomp, Julian showed himselfin the field of Mars to the soldiers, who glowed withardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil, theirleader, and their friend. He recapitulated their vic­tories, lamented their sufferings, applauded their re­solution, animated their hopes, and checked theirimpetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly, till hehad obtained a solemn promise from the troops, thatif the emperor of the East would subscribe an equita­ble treaty, they would renounce any views of con­quest, and satisfy themselves with the tranquil pos­session of the Gallic provinces. On this foundationhe composed, in his own name, and in that of thearmy, a specious and moderate epistle, which was de­livered to Pentadius, his master of the offices, andto his chamberlain Eutherius; two ambassadors whomhe appointed to receive the answer, and observe thedispositions of Constantius.

If Theodosius XXILhad consulted the rigid maxims of interest and policy,his conduct would have been justified by his friends;but the generosity of his behaviour on this memora­ble occasion has extorted the applause of his mostinveterate enemies. He seated Valentinian on thethrone of Milan; and, without stipulating any pre­sent or future advantages, restored him to the abso­lute dominion of all the provinces from which he hadbeen driven by the arms of Maximus. To the resti­tution of his ample patrimony, Theodosius added thefree and generous gift of the countries beyond theAlps, which his successful valour had recovered fromthe assassin of Gratian. Satisfied with the glory whichhe had acquired, by revenging the death of his bene­factor, and delivering the West from the yoke oftyranny, the emperor returned from Milan to Con­stantinople; and, in the peaceful possession of theEast, insensibly relapsed into his former habits ofluxury and indolence. Theodosius discharged hisobligation to the brother, he indulged his conjugaltenderness to the sister, of Valentinian; and poste­rity, which admires the pure and singular glory ofhis elevation, must applaud his unrivalled generosityin the use of victory.
The empress Justina did not long survive her re- characterturn to Italy; and, though she beheld the triumph {£^en"of Theodosius, she was not allowed to influence the A, D.381,government of her son *.

Without presuming to disputethe royal mandate, he requested the indulgence ofa few moments to embrace his weeping family; and,while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by aplentiful entertainment, he dexterously escaped tothe sea-coast of the Euxine, from whence he passedover to the country of Bosphorus. In that seques­tered region he remained many months, exposed tothe hardships of exile, of solitude, and of want; hismelancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes,and his mind agitated by the just apprehension, thatif any accident should discover his name, the faith­less Barbarians would violate, without much scruple,the laws of hospitality.

The body of thepeople was infected with a spirit of discontent: theyregretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust, whohad been imprudently dismissed from the praefectureof the East. They despised the character of Valens,which was rude without vigour, and feeble withoutmildness.

The unworthy spec­tacle of a Roman prince, who had renounced thedress and manners of his country, filled the minds ofthe legions with grief and indignation. Even theGermans, so strong and formidable in the armies ofthe empire, affected to disdain the strange and horridappearance of the savages of the North, who, in thespace of a few years, had wandered from the banks ofthe Volga to those of the Seine. A loud and licen­tious murmur was echoed through the camps andgarrisons of the West; and as the mild indolence ofGratian neglected to extinguish the first symptomsof discontent, the want of love and respect was notsupplied by the influence of fear.

WhileConstantius gave laws to the Barbarians beyond theDanube, he distinguished with specious compassionthe Sarmatian exiles, who had been expelled fromtheir native country by the rebellion of their slaves,and who formed a very considerable accession to thepower of the Quadi.

The disputed possession ofsome salt-pits engaged the Alemanni and the Bur-gundians in frequent contests: the latter were easilytempted, by the secret solicitations, and liberal offers,of the emperor; and their fabulous descent from theRoman soldiers, who had formerly been left to gar­rison the fortresses of Drusus, was admitted with mu­tual credulity, as it was conducive to mutual interest.An army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soonappeared on the banks of the Rhine; and impatientlyrequired the support and subsidies which Valentinianhad promised: but they were amused with excusesand delays, till at length, after a fruitless expecta­tion, they were compelled to retire.

Two ministers of illustriousrank, Domitian, the Oriental praefect, and Montius,quaestor of the palace, were empowered by a specialcommission to visit and reform the state of the East.They were instructed to behave towards Gallus withmoderation and respect, and, by the gentlest arts ofpersuasion, to engage him to comply with the in­vitation of his brother and colleague. The rashnessof the praefect disappointed these prudent measures,and hastened his own ruin, as well as that of hisenemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian passeddisdainfully before the gates of the palace, and al­leging a slight pretence of indisposition, continuedseveral days in sullen retirement, to prepare an in­flammatory memorial, which he transmitted to theImperial court. Yielding at length to the pressingsolicitations of Gallus, the praefect condescended totake his seat in council; but his first step was tosignify a concise and haughty mandate, importingthat the Caesar should immediately repair to Italy,and threatening that he himself would punish hisdelay or hesitation, by suspending the usual allow­ance of his household. The nephew and daughterof Constantine, who could ill brook the insolence ofa subject, expressed their resentment by instantlydelivering Domitian to the custody of a guard. Thequarrel still admitted of some terms of accommoda­tion.

On these banks tradition long preservedthe memory of the palace of Phineus, infested bythe obscene harpies t; and of the sylvan reign ofAmycus, who defied the son of Leda to the combatof the Cestus. The streights of the Bosphorus areterminated by the Cyanean rocks, which, accordingto the description of the poets, had once floated onthe face of the waters; and were destined by thegods to protect the entrance of the Euxine againstthe eye of profane curiosity. From the Cyaneanrocks to the point and harbour of Byzantium, thewinding length of the Bosphorus extends about six­teen miles, and its most ordinary breadth may becomputed at about one mile and a half. The newcastles of Europe and Asia are constructed, on eithercontinent, upon the foundations of two celebratedtemples, of Serapis and of Jupiter Urius. The oldcastles, a work of the Greek emperors, commandthe narrowest part of the channel, in a place wherethe opposite banks advance within five hundred pacesof each other.

The statues of Theodosius, of his father,of his wife Flacilla, of his two sons, Arcadius andHonorius, were insolently thrown down from theirpedestals, broken in pieces, or dragged with contemptthrough the streets; and the indignities which wereoffered to the representations of Imperial majestysufficiently declared the impious and treasonablewishes of the populace.

The public apprehen­sions were fortified by the strong suspicion, that thesetumults were not the effect of accidental passion, butthe result of deep and premeditated design.

Polytheism appears from this period to haye sunk so* rapidly in all the provinces, that twenty-eight years after the death of the greatXheodosius, we find in the Theodosian code of the second emperor of that rthe following words: Pagan OS quos supersunt, quanquam jum nuDos essmiu. This expression was undoubtedly rather too general, but we may cfrom it, that the number of pagans was at that time become very r~able. Ed.
Among many anecdotes respecting the destruction of the objects of jship, there is one which is so well told by Mr. Gibbon, that tie editor thinks thereader will not be displeased at its insertion. It relates to the celebrated statue ofSerapis at Alexandria.
"The colossal statue of Serapis was involved in the ruin of his temple and reli­gion. A great number of plates of different metals, artificially joined together,composed the majestic figure of the deity, who touched on either side the walls ofthe sanctuary. The aspect of Serapis, his sitting posture, and the sceptre, whichhe bore in his left hand, were extremely similar to the ordinary representations ofJupiter.
"He was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket, or bushel, which was placedon his head; and by the emblematic monster which he held in his right hand:the had and body of a serpent branching into three tails, which were again ter­minated by the triple heads of a dog, a lion, and a wolf. It was confidentlyaffirmed, that if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the god,the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their original chaos.
"An intrepid soldier animated by zeal, and armed with a weighty battle-axe,ascended the ladder; and even the Christian multitude expected, with someanxiety, the event of the combat , He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheekof Serapis; the cheek fell to the ground, the thunder was still silent, and both theheavens and the earth continued to preserve their accustomed order and tranquil­lity. The victorious soldier repeated his blows, the huge idol was overthrown,and broken in pieces; and the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously draggedthrough the streets of Alexandra. His mangled carcass was burnt in the am­phitheatre, amidst the shouts of the populace; and many persons attributed theirconversion to this discovery of the impotence of their tutelar deity. The popularmodes of religion, that propose any visible and material objects of worship, havethe advantage of adapting and familiarizing themselves to the senses of mankind:but this advantage is counterbalanced by the various and inevitable accidents towhich the faith of the idolater is exposed. It is scarcely possible that, in everydisposition of mind, he should preserve his implicit reverence for the idols, or therelics, which the naked eye, and the profane hand, are unable to distinguish fromthe most common productions of art, or nature; and if, in the hour of danger,their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own preservation, hescorns the vain apologies of his priests, and justly derides the objects, and the folly,of his superstitious attachments. After the fall of Serapis, some hopes were stillentertained by the pagans, that the Nile would refuse his annual supply to theimpious masters of Egypt; and the extraordinary delay of the inundation seemedto announce the displeasure of the river-god. But this delay was soon compen­sated by the rapid swell of the waters. They suddenly rose to such an unusualheight, as to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation of a de­luge; till the peaceful river again subsided to the well,known and fertilizing levelof sixteen cubits, or about thirty English feet."

I. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutableconstitution of human nature produces and maintainsso unequal a division of property, the most numerouspart of the community would be deprived of theirsubsistence, by the equal assessment of a tax fromwhich the sovereign would derive a very trifling re­venue. Such indeed might be the theory of theRoman capitation; but in the practice, this unjustequality was no longer felt, as the tribute was col­lected on the principle of a real, not of a personalimposition. Several indigent citizens contributed tocompose a single head, or share of taxation; whilethe wealthy provincial, in proportion to his fortune,alone represented several of those imaginary beings.In a poetical request, addressed to one of the lastand most deserving of the Roman princes whoreigned in Gaul, Sidonius Appollinaris personifieshis tribute under the figure of a triple monster, theGeryon of the Grecian fables, and intreats the newHercules that he would most graciously be pleasedto save his life by cutting off three of his heads. Thefortune of Sidonius far exceeded the customary wealthof a poet; but if he had pursued the allusion, hemust have painted many of the Gallic nobles withthe hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, spreadingover the face of the country, and devouring the sub­stance of a hundred families.

At the decease ofConstantine, the throne of the east was filled bySapor, son of Hormouz, or Hormisdas, and grandsonof Narses, who, after the victory of Galerius, hadhumbly confessed the superiority of the Romanpower. Although Sapor was in the thirtieth year ofhis long reign, he was still in the vigour of youth, asthe date of his accession, by a very strange fatality,had preceded that of his birth. The wife of Hor­mouz remained pregnant at the time of her husband'sdeath; and the uncertainty of the sex, as well as ofthe event, excited the ambitious hopes of the princesof the house of Sassan. The apprehensions of civilwar were at length removed, by the positive assuranceof the Magi, that the widow of Hormouz had con­ceived, and would safely produce a son. Obedientto the voice of superstition, the Persians prepared,without delay, the ceremony of his coronation. Aroyal bed, on which the queen lay in state, was exhi­bited in the midst of the palace; the diadem wasplaced on the spot, which might be supposed to con­ceal the future heir of Artaxerxes, and the prostrateSatraps adored the majesty of their invisible and in­sensible sovereign. If any credit can be given tothis marvellous tale, which seems however to be coun­tenanced by the manners of the people, and by theextraordinary duration of his reign, we must admirenot only the fortune, but the genius, of Sapor.

The respectful submission withwhich they yielded to the order of their march mightbe considered as a proof of their fidelity; and theirmoderate request of a sufficient allowance of provi­sions, and of a delay of only two days, was expressedin the most dutiful terms. But the first magistrateof Hadrianople, incensed by some disorders whichhad been committed at his country-house, refusedthis indulgence; and arming against them the inha­bitants and manufacturers of a populous city, heurged, with hostile threats, their instant departure.The Barbarians stood silent and amazed, till theywere exasperated by the insulting clamours, and mis­sile weapons, of the populace: but when patience orcontempt was fatigued, they crushed the undisciplinedmultitude, inflicted many a shameful wound on thebacks of their flying enemies, and despoiled them ofthe splendid armour, which they were unworthy tobear.

The funeral ofAthanaric was performed with solemn rites in thecapital of the East; a stately monument was erectedto his memory; and his whole army, won by theliberal courtesy, and decent grief, of Theodosius,inlisted under the standard of the Roman empire*.The submission of so great a body of the Visigothswas productive of the most salutary consequences;and the mixed influence of force, of reason, and ofcorruption, became every day more powerful, andmore extensive. Each independent chieftain hastenedto obtain a separate treaty, from the apprehension thatan obstinate delay might expose him, alone and un­protected, to the revenge, or justice, of the conqueror.The general, or rather the final, capitulation of theGoths, may be dated four years, one month, anda.d. 382. twenty-five days, after the defeat and death of the

But the count, long exercised in the artsof corruption, had despatched a swift and trusty mes­senger to secure the venal friendship of Remigius,master of the offices. The wisdom of the Imperialcouncil was deceived by artifice; and their honestindignation was cooled by delay. At length, whenthe repetition of complaint had been justified by the*repetition of public misfortunes, the notary Palladiuswas sent from the court of Treves, to examine thestate of Africa, and the conduct of Romanus. Therigid impartiality of Palladius was easily disarmed:he was tempted to reserve for himself a part of thepublic treasure, which he brought with him for thepayment of the troops; and from the moment thathe was conscious of his own guilt, he could no longerrefuse to attest the innocence and merit of the count.The charge of the Tripolitans was declared to befalse and frivolous; and Palladius himself was sentback from Treves to Africa, with a special commissionto discover and prosecute the authors of this impiousconspiracy against the representatives of the sove­reign. His inquiries were managed with so muchdexterity and success, that he compelled the citizensof Leptis, who had sustained a recent siege of eightdays, to contradict the truth of their own decrees,and to censure the behaviour of their own deputies.A bloody sentence was pronounced, without hesita­tion, by the rash and headstrong cruelty of Valen-. tinian.

He was assisted by the eloquentMamertinus, one of the consuls elect, whose merit isloudly celebrated by the doubtful evidence of his ownapplause. But the civil wisdom of two magistrateswas overbalanced by the ferocious violence of fourgenerals, Nevitta, Agilo, Jovinus, and Arbetio.Arbetio, whom the public would have seen with lesssurprise at the bar than on the bench, was supposedto possess the secret of the commission: the armedand angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bandsencompassed the tribunal; and the judges werealternately swayed by the laws of justice, and by theclamours of faction.
The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abusedthe the favour of Constantius, expiated, by an ignomi­nious death, the insolence, the corruption, andcruelty of his servile reign. The executions of Pauland Apodemius (the former of whom was burnt alive)were accepted as an inadequate atonement by thewidows and orphans of so many hundred Romans,whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and mur­dered. But Justice herself (if we may use the pa­thetic expression of Ammianus*) appeared to weepover the fate of Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire;and his blood accused the ingratitude of Julian,whose distress had been seasonably relieved by theintrepid liberality of that honest minister. The rageof the soldiers, whom he had provoked by his indis­cretion, was the cause and the excuse of his death;and the emperor, deeply wounded by his own re­proaches and those of the public, offered some con­solation to the family of Ursulus, by the restitution

The institutions of Valentinian contri­buted to secure the benefits of peace and plenty;and the cities were guarded by the establishment ofthe Defensors; freely elected as the tribunes andadvocates of the people, to support their rights, andto expose their grievances, before the tribunals of thecivil magistrates, or even at the foot of the Imperialthrone. The finances were diligently administeredby two princes, who had been so long accustomedto the rigid economy of a private fortune; but inthe receipt and application of the revenue, a dis­cerning eye might observe some difference betweenthe government of the East and of the West. Valenswas persuaded, that royal liberality can be sup­plied only by public oppression, and his ambitionnever aspired to secure, by their actual distress, thefuture strength and prosperity of his people. Insteadof increasing the weight of taxes, which, in the spaceof forty years, had been gradually doubled, he re­duced, in the first years of his reign, one-fourth ofthe tribute of the East. Valentinian appears to havebeen less attentive and less anxious to relieve theburthens of his people. He might reform the abusesof the fiscal administration; but he exacted, withoutscruple, a very large share of the private property; ashe was convinced that the revenues, which supportedthe luxury of individuals, would be much more advan-

The Bar­barians, who considered their arms as the ensigns ofhonour, and the pledges of safety, were disposed tooffer a price, which the lust or avarice of the Imperialofficers was easily tempted to accept. To preservetheir arms, the haughty warriors consented, with somereluctance, to prostitute their wives or their daughters.The Goths, with arms in their hands, were permittedto enter the boats; and when their strength was col­lected on the other side of the river, the immensecamp which was spread over the plains and the hillsof the Lower Maesia assumed a threatening and evenhostile aspect. The leaders of the Ostrogoths, Ala-theus and Saphrax, the guardians of their infant king,appeared soon afterwards on the northern banks ofthe Danube; and immediately despatched their ambas­sadors to the court of Antioch, to solicit, with thesame professions of allegiance and gratitude, the samefavour which had been granted to the suppliant Visi­goths.

The most exquisite dainties were procured,to gratify their pride, rather than their taste; birdsof the most distant climates, fish from the most re­mote seas, fruits out of their natural season, winterroses, and summer snows.

About the same time,Count Richomer returned from the West, to announcethe defeat and submission of the Alemanni, to informValens, that his nephew advanced by rapid marchesat the head of the veteran and victorious legions ofGaul; and to request, in the name of Gratian andof the republic, that every dangerous and decisivemeasure might be suspended, till the junction of thetwo emperors should ensure the success of the Gothicwar. But the feeble sovereign of the East wasactuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jea­lousy. He disdained the importunate advice; herejected the humiliating aid; he secretly comparedthe ignominious, or at least the inglorious, period ofhis own reign, with the fame of a beardless youth;and Valens rushed into the field, to erect his ima­ginary trophy, before the diligence of his colleaguecould usurp any share of the triumphs of the day.
On the ninth of August, a day which has deservedto be marked among the most inauspicious of theRoman Calendar *, the emperor Valens, leaving,under a strong guard, his baggage and military trea­sure, marched from Hadrianople to attack the Goths,who were encamped about twelve miles from thecity t. By some mistake of the orders, or some ig­norance of the ground, the right wing, or column ofcavalry, arrived in sight of the enemy, whilst the leftwas still at a considerable distance; the soldiers werecompelled, in the sultry heat of summer, to precipi­tate their pace; and the line of battle was formedwith tedious confusion, and irregular delay.

In this rapid jour­ney, the profound respect which was due to thebrother and colleague of Constantius was insensiblychanged into rude familiarity; and Gallus, who dis­covered in the countenances of the attendants thatthey already considered themselves as his guards, andmight soon be employed as his executioners, beganto accuse his fatal rashness, and to recollect with ter-.ror and remorse the conduct by which he had pro­voked his fate. The dissimulation which had hithertobeen preserved was laid aside at Petovjo in Pannonia.He was conducted to a palace in the suburbs, wherethe general Barbatio, with a select band of soldiers,who could neither be moved by pity, nor corruptedby rewards, expected the arrival of his illustriousvictim. In the close of the evening he was arrested,ignominiously stripped of the ensigns of Cassar, andhurried away to Pola in Istria, a sequestered prisonwhich had been so recently polluted with royal blood.The horror which he felt was soon increased by theappearance of his implacable enemy the eunuchEusebius, who, with the assistance of a notary and atribune, proceeded to interrogate him concerning theadministration of the East. The Cajsar sunk underthe weight of shame and guilt, confessed all the cri­minal actions, and all the treasonable designs withwhich he was charged; and by imputing them to theadvice of his wife, exasperated the indignation ofConstantius, who reviewed with partial prejudice theminutes of the examination.

The severity of theclimate was tempered by the neighbourhood of theocean; and with some precautions, which experiencehad taught, the vine and fig-tree were successfullycultivated. But, in remarkable winters, the Seinewas deeply frozen; and the huge pieces of ice thatfloated down the stream might be compared, by anAsiatic, to the blocks of white marble which wereextracted from the quarries of Phrygia. The licen­tiousness and corruption of Antioch recalled to thememory of Julian the severe and simple manners ofhis beloved Lutetia *; where the amusements of thetheatre were unknown or despised.

The merit of Maximin,who had slaughtered the noblest families of Rome,was rewarded with the royal approbation, and theprefecture of Gaul. Two fierce and enormous bears,distinguished by the appellations of Innocence, andMica Aurea, could alone deserve to share the favourof Maximin. The cages of those trusty guards werealways placed near the bed-chamber of Valentinian,. who frequently amused his eyes with the gratefulspectacle of seeing them tear and devour the bleedinglimbs of the malefactors who were abandoned to theirrage.

Theveteran troops were hastily recalled from the defenceof Armenia; that important frontier was abandonedto the discretion of Sapor; and the immediate con­duct of the Gothic war was intrusted, during theabsence of Valens, to his lieutenants Trajan and Pro-futurus, two generals who indulged themselves in avery false and favourable opinion of their own abili­ties. On their arrival in Thrace, they were joinedby Richomer, count of the domestics; and the auxi­liaries of the West, that marched under his banner,were composed of the Gallic legions, reduced indeedby a spirit of desertion to the vain appearances ofstrength and numbers.

The assembly was dismissed; and Leonas,who, with some difficulty, had been protected fromthe popular fury, was sent back to his master, withan epistle, in which Julian expressed, in a strain ofthe most vehement eloquence, the sentiments of con­tempt, of hatred, and of resentment, which had beensuppressed and embittered by the dissimulation oftwenty years. After this message, which might beconsidered as a signal of irreconcilable war, Julian,who some weeks before had celebrated the Christianfestival of the Epiphany, made a public declaration,that he committed the care of his safety to the im­mortal gods; and thus publicly renounced the re­ligion, as well as the friendship, of Constantius *.

When the event hap­pened, Ammianus was at no greater distance fromJerusalem than Antioch, where he held a distin­guished office in the court of Julian. The under­taking and its failure must have been known to himat the time.

It is universally known that it was notrebuilt: and Ammianus, at the expiration of twentyyears, relates in his history the circumstance whichprevented it. If he had written this account imme­diately after the occurrence, it might have been saidit was a rumour invented by party zeal, and propa­gated by enthusiasm and credulity. It might thenhave been urged, that the imposition and falsehoodwould probably, in a short time, have been detected;that pagan authors would have exposed the deceptionswhich had originated from the Christians; and thatif Ammianus had written a few years later, he wouldprobably have had a clearer view of the matter, andwould not have given credit to the romance of theday.

The pleasant situation of the gardens alongthe banks of the Tigris was improved, according tothe Persian taste, by the symmetry of flowers, foun­tains, and shady walks; and spacious parks were en­closed for the reception of the bears, lions, and wildboars, which were maintained at a considerable ex­pense for the pleasure of the royal chase. The parkwalls were broke down, the savage game was aban­doned to the darts of the soldiers, and the palaces ofSapor were reduced to ashes, by the command of theRoman emperor. Julian, on this occasion, showedhimself ignorant, or careless, of the laws of civility,which the prudence and refinement of polished ageshave established between hostile princes. Yet thesewanton ravages need not excite in our breasts anyvehement emotions of pity or resentment. A simple,naked statue, finished by the hand of a Grecian artist,is of more genuine value than all these rude and costlymonuments of Barbaric labour; and if we are moredeeply affected by the ruin of a palace than by theconflagration of a cottage, our humanity must haveformed a very erroneous estimate of the miseries ofhuman life #.

The Constan.Barbarians of Germany had felt, and still dreaded, j^fmthe arms of the young Caesar; his soldiers were thecompanions of his victory; the grateful provincialsenjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favourites,who had opposed his elevation, were offended by hisvirtues; and they justly considered the friend of thepeople as the enemy of the court. As long as thefame of Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of thepalace, who were skilled in the language of satire,tried the efficacy of those arts which they had sooften practised with success. They easily discovered,that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation:the ridiculous epithets of an hairy savage, of an apeinvested with the purple, were applied to the dressand person of the philosophic warrior; and his modestdespatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaboratefictions of a loquacious Greek, a speculative soldier,who had studied the art of war amidst the groves ofthe academy. The voice of malicious folly was atlength silenced by the shouts of victory; the con­queror of the Franks and Alemanni could no longerbe painted as an object of contempt; and the mon­arch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing fromhis lieutenant the honourable reward of his labours.

Of Ammianus and his history itmay with great propriety be said, "Amicus Julianus,"magis arnica Veritas." This historian, after twentyyears, relates the unpleasant occurrence in the mostplain, but most decisive, language. He does not(like the Christian fathers) enlarge on miraculousappearances; but tells the story as a true undisputedmatter of fact. If, in twenty years, any impositionhad been detected, if any false assertions of the Chris­tians had been disproved, if any pagans or Jews, orany person whatever, had controverted the truth ofthe statement which was made at the time of the oc­currence, Ammianus would certainly have noticedthem.

As the history of this period of the empire is prin­cipally derived from Ammianus Marcellinus, I thinkit will not be improper to add a few words respectingthis valuable historian, with whose life and writingsthe generality of readers are not as well acquaintedas with Livy and Sallust.
Ammianus Marcellinus was an officer of distinc­tion in the Roman army, and served under Julian inthe Persian war. His religion was the same as theemperor's; and he appears to have been much at­tached to his person. After retiring from the militaryprofession, he resided at Rome; where he employed

The Romans,who now aspired only to the permission of a safe andspeedy retreat, endeavoured to persuade themselves,that this formidable appearance was occasioned bya troop of wild asses, or perhaps by the approach ofsome friendly Arabs. They halted, pitched theirtents, fortified their camp, passed the whole night incontinual alarms; and discovered, at the dawn of day,that they were surrounded by an army of Persians.This army, which might be considered only as thevan of the Barbarians, was soon followed by the mainbody of cuirassiers, archers and elephants, commandedby Meranes, a general of rank and reputation.

The Persians repeatedly charged with fury;they were repeatedly repulsed with firmness; and theaction at Maronga, which almost deserved the nameof a battle, was marked by a considerable loss of sa­traps and elephants, perhaps of equal value in theeyes of their monarch. These splendid advantageswere not obtained without an adequate slaughter onthe side of the Romans: several officers of distinctionwere either killed or wounded; and the emperorhimself, who, on all occasions of danger, inspired andguided the valour of his troops, was obliged to exposehis person, and exert his abilities.

The death of Julian had left the public affairs of chap.the empire in a very doubtful and dangerous situation.'The Roman army was saved by an inglorious, perhaps state of thea necessary treaty; and the first moments of peace a. d. 363.were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore thedomestic tranquillity of the church and state. Theindiscretion of his predecessor, instead of reconciling,had artfully fomented the religious war: and thebalance which he affected to preserve between thehostile factions served only to perpetuate the con­test, by the vicissitudes of hope and fear, by the rivalclaims of ancient possession and actual favour. Inprivate families, the sentiments of nature were ex­tinguished by the blind fury of zeal and revenge:the majesty of the laws was violated or abused; thecities of the East were stained with blood; and themost implacable enemies of the Romans were in thebosom of their country. Jovian was educated in theprofession of Christianity; and as he marched fromNisibis to Antioch, the banner of the Cross, theLabarum of Constantine, which was again displayedat the head of the legions, announced to the people thefaith of their new emperor. As soon as he ascendedthe throne, he transmitted a circular epistle to all thegovernors of provinces: in which he confessed thedivine truth, and secured the legal establishment, ofthe christian religion.

The dissimulation of Julian lasted above ten years,from his secret initiation at Ephesus, to the begin­ning of the civil war; when he declared himself atonce the implacable enemy of Christ and of Con­stants. This state of constraint might contributeto strengthen his devotion; and as soon as he hadsatisfied the obligation of assisting, on solemn festi­vals, at the assemblies of the Christians, Julian re­turned, with the impatience of a lover, to burn hisfree and voluntary incense on the domestic chapelsof Jupiter and Mercury.

Thet public establishment of Christianity may herebe considered as one of those important revolutionswhich excite the most lively curiosity, and afford themost valuable instruction. The victories and thecivil policy of Constantine no longer influence thestate of Europe; but a considerable portion of theglobe still retains the impression which it receivedfrom the conversion of that monarch; and the eccle­siastical institutions of his reign are still connected,by an indissoluble chain, with the opinions and theinterests of the present generation.
In the consideration of a subject which may be ex­amined with impartiality, but cannot be viewed withindifference, a difficulty immediately arises of a veryunexpected nature; that of ascertaining the real andprecise date of the conversion of Constantine. Theeloquent Lactantius, in the midst of his court, seemsimpatient to proclaim to the world the glorious exam­ple of the sovereign of Gaul, who in the first momentsof his reign acknowledged and adored the majesty ofthe true and only God. The learned Eusebius hasascribed the faith of Constantine to the miraculoussign of the cross which was displayed in the heavenswhilst he meditated and prepared the Italian expedi­tion; but it is certain that his baptism was delayedtill the moment of his death.

The rear-guard wasthrown into disorder; the renowned legions, whichderived their titles from Diocletian, and his warlikecolleague, were broke and trampled down by theelephants; and three tribunes lost their lives in at­tempting to stop the flight of their soldiers. Thebattle was at length restored by the perseveringvalour of the Romans; the Persians were repulsedwith a great slaughter of men and elephants; andthe army, after marching and fighting a long sum­mer's day, arrived, in the evening, at Samara onthe banks of the Tigris, about one hundred milesabove Ctesiphon. On the ensuing day, the Barba­rians, instead of harassing the march, attacked thecamp, of Jovian; which had been seated in a deepand sequestered valley. From the hills, the archersof Persia insulted and annoyed the wearied legion­aries; and a body of cavalry, which had penetratedwith desperate courage through the Praetorian gate,was cut in pieces, after a doubtful conflict, near theImperial tent.

The celestial gift which Achilles obtained, andAlexander envied, of a poet worthy to celebrate theactions of heroes, has been enjoyed by Stilicho, in amuch higher degree than might have been expectedfrom the declining state of genius, and of art. Themuse of Claudian, devoted to his service, was alwaysprepared to stigmatize his adversaries, Rufinus orEutropius, with eternal infamy; or to paint, in themost splendid colours, the victories, and virtues, of apowerful benefactor. In the review of a period in­differently supplied with authentic materials, we can­not refuse to illustrate the annals of Honorius fromthe invectives, or the panegyrics, of a contemporarywriter; but as Claudian appears to have indulged themost ample privilege of a poet and a courtier, somecriticism will be requisite to translate the languageof fiction, or exaggeration, into the truth and simpli­city of historic prose. His silence concerning thefamily of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof, thathis patron was neither able, nor desirous, to boast ofa long series of illustrious progenitors; and the slightmention of his father, an officer of Barbarian cavalry,in the service of Valens, seems to countenance theassertion, that the general, who so long commandedthe armies of Rome, was descended from the savageand perfidious race of the Vandals. If Stilicho hadnot possessed the external advantages of strengthand stature, the most flattering bard, in the pre­sence of so many thousand spectators, would havehesitated to affirm, that he surpassed the measureof the demigods of antiquity; and that wheneverhe moved, with lofty steps, through the streets of

At length, twenty-four days after the sedi­tion, the general Hellebicus, and Caesarius, master ofthe offices, declared the will of the emperor, and thesentence of Antioch. That proud capital was de­graded from the rank of a city; and the metropolisof the East, stripped of its lands, its privileges, and itsrevenues, was subjected, under the humiliating deno­mination of a village, to the jurisdiction of Laodicea.The Baths, the Circus, and the Theatres, were shut;and, that every source of plenty and pleasure mightat the same time be intercepted, the distribution ofcorn was abolished, by the severe instructions ofTheodosius.

The last division of this unfortunatefleet might regain the opposite shore; but the distressand disorder of the multitude rendered them alikeincapable, either of action or counsel; and they soonimplored the clemency of the victorious enemy.

Their numberwas soon doubled by the division of the east andwest; and as separate generals of the same rankand title were appointed on the four important fron­tiers of the Rhine, of the Upper and the LowerDanube, and of the Euphrates, the defence of theRoman empire was at length committed to eightmasters general of the cavalry and infantry. Undertheir orders, thirty-five military commanders werestationed in the provinces: three in Britain, six inGaul, one in Spain, one in Italy, five on the Upper,and four on the Lower Danube; in Asia eight, threein Egypt, and four in Africa.

But it should be recollected, thatthe second of those appellations is only a corruptionof the Latin word, which was indiscriminately ap­plied to any military chief. All these provincialgenerals were therefore dukes; but no more thanten among them were dignified with the rank ofcounts or companions, a title of honour, or ratherof favour, which had been recently invented in thecourt of Constantine.

But the Romans of theWest soon rallied, by the habits of discipline; andthe Barbarians of Germany supported the renown oftheir national bravery. The engagement soon be­came general; was maintained with various 'andsingular turns of fortune, and scarcely ended withthe darkness of the night. The signal victory whichConstantius obtained is attributed to the arms ofhis cavalry. His cuirassiers are described as somany massy statues of steel, glittering with theirscaly armour, and breaking with their ponderouslances the firm array of the Gallic legions. Assoon as the legions gave way, the lighter and moreactive squadrons of the second line rode swordin hand into the intervals, and completed the dis­order. In the mean while, the huge bodies of theGermans were exposed almost naked to the dex­terity of the oriental archers; and whole troops ofthose Barbarians were urged by anguish and despairto precipitate themselves into the broad and rapidstream of the Drave. The number of the slain wascomputed at fifty-four thousand men, andthe slaughterof the conquerors was more considerable than that ofthe vanquished; a circumstance which proves the ob­stinacy of the contest, and justifies the observationof an ancient writer, that the forces of the empirewere consumed in the fatal battle of Mursa, by the

The soldiers passed successively inreview; and each of them, before he received fromthe hand of Julian a liberal donative, proportionedto his rank and services, was required to cast a fewgrains of incense into the flame which burnt uponthe altar. Some Christian confessors might resist,and others might repent; but the far greater num­ber, allured by the prospect of gold, and awed bythe presence of the emperor, contracted the criminalengagement; and their future perseverance in theworship of the gods was enforced by every consider­ation of duty and of interest. By the frequent re­petition of these arts, and at the expense of sumswhich would have purchased the service of half thenations of Scythia, Julian gradually acquired for histroops the imaginary protection of the gods, and forhimself the firm and effectual support of the Romanlegions. It is indeed more than probable, that therestoration and encouragement of Paganism revealeda multitude of pretended Christians, who, from mo­tives of temporal advantage, had acquiesced in thereligion of the former reign; and who afterwardsreturned, with the same flexibility of conscience, tothe faith which was professed by the successors ofJulian.

After the tumult of Alexandria had subsided, RestorationAthanasius, amidst the public acclamations, seated °iu8,himself on the throne from whence his unworthy jy^?2'competitor had been precipitated: and as the zeal ofthe archbishop was tempered with discretion, theexercise of his authority tended not to inflame, butto reconcile, the minds of the people. His pastorallabours were not confined to the narrow limits ofEgypt. The state of the Christian world was presentto his active and capacious mind; and the age, themerit, the reputation of Athanasius, enabled him toassume, in a moment of danger, the office of Ecclesi­astical Dictator.

He maintained, that the Galilaeans, whomhe had recalled from exile, were not restored, bythat general indulgence, to the possession of theirrespective churches: and he expressed his astonish­ment, that a criminal, who had been repeatedly con­demned by the judgment of the emperors, shoulddare to insult the majesty of the laws, and insolentlyusurp the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria, with­out expecting the orders of his sovereign. As apunishment for the imaginary offence, he againbanished Athanasius from the city; and he waspleased to suppose, that this act of justice would behighly agreeable to his pious subjects. The pressingsolicitations of the people soon convinced him, thatthe majority of the Alexandrians were Christians;

At this importantcrisis, the military government of Thrace was exer­cised by Lupicinus and Maximus, in whose venalminds the slightest hope of private emolument out­weighed every consideration of public advantage, andwhose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity ofdiscerning the pernicious effects of their rash and cri­minal administration. Instead of obeying the ordersof their sovereign, and satisfying, with decent libe­rality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an un­generous and oppressive tax on the wants of the hun­gry Barbarians. The vilest food was sold at an ex­travagant price; and, in the room of wholesome andsubstantial provisions, the markets were filled withthe flesh of dogs, and of unclean animals, who haddied of disease.

When he arrivedat Sirmium, he gave audience to the deputies of theIllyrian provinces; who loudly congratulated theirown felicity under the auspicious government ofProbus, his Praetorian praefect. Valentinian, who wasflattered by these demonstrations of their loyalty andgratitude, imprudently asked the deputy of Epirus,a Cynic philosopher of intrepid sincerity, whetherhe was freely sent by the wishes of the province?"With tears and groans am I sent (replied Iphicles)"by a reluctant people." The emperor paused: butthe impunity of his ministers established the perni­cious maxim, that they might oppress his subjects,without injuring his service. A strict inquiry intotheir conduct would have relieved the public discon­tent. The severe condemnation of the murder ofGabinius was the only measure which could restorethe confidence of the Germans, and vindicate thehonour of the Roman name. But the haughty mon­arch was incapable of the magnanimity which dares toacknowledge a fault. He forgot the provocation, re­membered only the injury, and advanced into thecountry of the Quadi with an insatiate thirst of blood• and revenge. The extreme devastation, and promis­cuous massacre, of a savage war, were justified, in theeyes of the emperor, and perhaps in those of theworld, by the cruel equity of retaliation; and suchwas the discipline of the Romans, and the consterna­tion of the enemy, that Valentinian repassed theDanube without the loss of a single man. As he hadresolved to complete the destruction of the Quadi bya second campaign, he fixed his winter-quarters atBregetio, on the Danube, near the Hungarian cityof Presburgh. While the operations of war weresuspended by the severity of the weather, the Quadimade an humble attempt to deprecate the wrath of

The monarch started fromhis couch, and stepping forth, to refresh his weariedspirits with the coolness of the midnight air, he be­held a fiery meteor, which shot athwart the sky, andsuddenly vanished. Julian was convinced that hehad seen the menacing countenance of the god ofwar; the council which he summoned, of TuscanHaruspices, unanimously pronounced that he shouldabstain from action: but, on this occasion, necessityand reason were more prevalent than superstition;and the trumpets sounded at the break of day.

Thefunctions of a judge, which are sometimes incompati­ble with those of a prince, were exercised by Julian,not only as a duty, but as an amusement; andalthough he might have trusted the integrity anddiscernment of his Praetorian prasfects, he oftenplaced himself by their side on the seat of judgment.The acute penetration of his mind was agreeablyoccupied in detecting and defeating the chicanery ofthe advocates, who laboured to disguise the truth offacts, and to pervert the sense of the laws. He some­times forgot the gravity of his station, asked indis­creet or unseasonable questions, and betrayed, by theloudness of his voice, and the agitation of his body,the earnest vehemence with which he maintained hisopinion against the judges, the advocates, and theirclients.

Julian re-pollected with terror the observation of his masterPlato, that the government of our flocks and herds isalways committed to beings of a superior species; andthat the conduct of nations requires and deserves thecelestial powers of the Gods or of the Genii. Fromthis principle he justly concluded, that the man whopresumes to reign should aspire to the perfectionof the divine nature; that he should purify his soulfrom her mortal and terrestrial part; that he shouldextinguish his appetites, enlighten his understanding,regulate his passions, and subdue the wild beast,which, according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle,seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot. Thethrone of Julian, which the death of Constantiusfixed on an independent basis, was the seat of reason,of virtue, and perhaps of vanity. He despised thehonours, renounced the pleasures, and dischargedwith incessant diligence the duties, of his exaltedstation; and there were few among his subjects whowould have consented to relieve him from the weightof the diadem, had they been obliged to submit theirtime and their actions to the rigorous laws whichtheir philosophic emperor imposed on himself., Oneof his most intimate friends f, who had often sharedthe frugal simplicity of his table, has remarked, thathis light and sparing diet (which was usually of the

The punishment of a Ro­man city was blindly committed to the undistinguish-ing sword of the Barbarians; and the hostile pre­parations were concerted with the dark and perfidiousartifice of an illegal conspiracy. The people of Thes-salonica were treacherously invited, in the name oftheir sovereign, to the games of the Circus; and suchwas their insatiate avidity for those amusements, thatevery consideration of fear, or suspicion, was disre­garded by the numerous spectators. As soon as theassembly was complete, the soldiers, who had secretlybeen posted round the Circus, received the signal,not of the races, but of a general massacre. The pro­miscuous carnage continued three hours, without dis­crimination of strangers or natives, of age or sex, ofinnocence or guilt: the most moderate accounts statethe number of the slain at seven thousand; and it isaffirmed by some writers, that more than fifteen thou­sand victims were sacrificed to the manes of Botheric.A foreign merchant, who had probably no concernin his murder, offered his own life, and all his wealth,to supply the place of one of his two sons; but, whilethe father hesitated with equal tenderness, while hewas doubtful to choose, and unwilling to condemn, thesoldiers determined his suspense, by plunging theirdaggers at the same moment into the breasts of thedefenceless youths. The apology of the assassins,that they were obliged to produce the prescribednumber of heads, serves only to increase, by an ap­pearance of order and design, the horrors of the mas­sacre, which was executed by the commands of Theo­dosius.

Theyalleged, that they had fulfilled the duty of allies, byassisting the kinsman and successor of the emperorJulian; they required the immediate restitution ofthe noble captives; and they urged a very singularclaim, that the Gothic generals, marching in arms,and in hostile array, were entitled to the sacred cha­racter and privileges of ambassadors. The decent,but peremptory, refusal of these extravagant demands,was signified to the Barbarians by Victor, master-general of the cavalry; who expressed, with forceand dignity, the just complaints of the emperor of theEast. The negotiation was interrupted; and the manlyexhortations of Valentinian encouraged his timid bro­ther to vindicate the insulted majesty of the empire.

As they advanced in yearsand experience, the limits of their authority were in­sensibly enlarged: but the emperor always reservedfor himself the title of Augustus; and while heshowed the Ccesars to the armies and provinces, hemaintained every part of the empire in equal obedi­ence to its supreme head*. The tranquillity of thelast fourteen years of his reign was scarcely inter­rupted by the contemptible insurrection of a camel-driver in the island of Cyprus, or by the active partwhich the policy of Constantine engaged him toassume in the wars of the Goths and Sarmatians.

According to the various accidentsof peace and war, of alliance or conquest, the Sar­matians were sometimes confined to the banks of theTanais; and they sometimes spread themselves overthe immense plains which lie between the Vistula andthe Volga. The care of their numerous flocks andherds, the pursuit of game, and the exercise of war,or rather of rapine, directed the vagrant motions ofthe Sarmatians.

After this signal xx'victory, Valentinian returned to his winter-quartersat Treves; where he indulged the public joy by theexhibition of splendid and triumphal games. Butthe wise monarch, instead of aspiring to the conquestof Germany, confined his attention to the importantand laborious defence of the Gallic frontier, againstan enemy, whose strength was renewed by a streamof daring volunteers, which incessantly flowed fromthe most distant tribes of the North. The banks ofthe Rhine, from its source to the straits of theocean, were closely planted with strong castles andconvenient towers; new works, and new arms, wereinvented by the ingenuity of a prince who was skilled'in the mechanical arts; and his numerous levies ofRoman and Barbarian youth were severely trainedin all the exercises of war. The progress of thework, which was sometimes opposed by modest re­presentations, and sometimes by hostile attempts,secured the tranquillity of Gaul during the nine sub­sequent years of the administration of Valentinian.

The Imperial wheat was purchasedby the rich merchants; the proprietors of land, orof corn, withheld from the city the accustomed sup­ply; and the small quantities that appeared in themarket were secretly sold at an advanced and illegalprice. Julian still continued to applaud his ownpolicy, treated the complaints of the people as a vainand ungrateful murmur, and convinced Antioch thathe had inherited the obstinacy, though not the cruelty,of his brother Gallus. The remonstrances of themunicipal senate served only to exasperate his in­flexible mind. He was persuaded, perhaps with truth,that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands, orwere concerned in trade, had themselves contributedto the calamities of their country; and he imputedthe disrespectful boldness which they assumed tothe sense, not of public duty, but of private interest.The whole body, consisting of two hundred of themost noble and wealthy citizens, were sent under aguard from the palace to the prison; and thoughthey were permitted, before the close of evening, toreturn to their respective houses, the emperor him­self could not obtain the forgiveness which he hadso easily granted.

The anxious tenderness of his father was conti­nually employed to bestow on him those advantages,which he might perhaps esteem the more highly, ashe himself had been deprived of them; and the mostskilful masters of every science, and of every art, hadlaboured to form the mind and body of the youngprince. The knowledge which they painfully com­municated was displayed with ostentation, and cele­brated with lavish praise. His soft and tractable dis­position received the fair impression of their judiciousprecepts, and the absence of passion might easily bemistaken for the strength of reason. His preceptorsgradually rose to the rank and consequence of mini­sters of state; and, as they wisely dissembled theirsecret authority, he seemed to act with firmness, withpropriety, and with judgment, on the most importantoccasions of his life and reign.

The luxury of the palace ex­cited the contempt and indignation of Julian, whousually slept on the ground, who yielded with re­luctance to the indispensable calls of nature; andwho placed his vanity, not in emulating, but in de­spising, the pomp of royalty. By the total extirpa­tion of a mischief which was magnified even beyondits real extent, he was impatient to relieve the di­stress, and to appease the murmurs, of the people;who support with less uneasiness the weight of taxes,if they are convinced that the fruits of their industryare appropriated to the service of the state. But inthe execution of this salutary work, Julian is accusedof proceeding with too much haste and inconsiderateseverity. By a single edict, he reduced the palaceof Constantinople to an immense desert, and dis­missed with ignominy the whole train of slaves anddependents, without providing any just, or at leastbenevolent, exceptions, for the age, the services, orthe poverty, of the faithful domestics of the Im­perial family. Such indeed was the temper of Ju­lian, who seldom recollected the fundamental maximof Aristotle, that true virtue is placed at an equaldistance between the opposite vices. The splendidand effeminate dress of the Asiatics, the curls andpaint, the collars and bracelets, which had appearedso ridiculous in the person of Constantine, were con­sistently rejected by his philosophic successor. Butwith the fopperies, Julian affected to renounce thedecencies of dress; and seemed to value himself forhis neglect of the laws of cleanliness.

His ex­pectations were disappointed by the treachery of theArmenian king, who permitted, and most probablydirected, the desertion of his auxiliary troops fromthe camp of the Romans f; and by the dissensionsof the two generals, who were incapable of formingor executing any plan for the public service.

In the various states of society, armies are re- chap.cruited from very different motives. Barbarians are XIV"urged by the love of war; the citizens of a free re- Difficultypublic may be prompted by a principle of duty; the of levies'subjects, or at least the nobles of a monarchy, are ani­mated by a sentiment of honour; but the timid andluxurious inhabitants of a declining empire must beallured into the service by the hopes of profit, orcompelled by the dread of punishment. The re­sources of the Roman treasury were exhausted by theincrease of pay, by the repetition of donatives, andby the invention of new emoluments and indulgences,which, in the opinion of the provincial youth, mightcompensate the hardships and dangers of a militarylife. Yet, although the stature was lowered, althoughslaves, at least by a tacit connivance, were indis­criminately received into the ranks, the insurmount­able difficulty of procuring a regular and adequatesupply of volunteers, obliged the emperors to adoptmore effectual and coercive methods. The landsbestowed on the veterans, as the free reward of theirvalour, were henceforward granted under a condition,which contains the first rudiments of the feudal te­nures; that their sons, who succeeded to the inhe­ritance, should devote themselves to the profession ofarms, as soon as they attained the age of manhood;and their cowardly refusal was punished by the lossof honour, of fortune, or even of life. But as theannual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a verysmall proportion to the demands of the service, leviesof men were frequently required from the provinces,and every proprietor was obliged either to take uparms, or to procure a substitute, or to purchase hisexemption by the payment of a heavy fine/ The sumof forty-two pieces of gold, to which it was reduced,ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers, and thereluctance with which the government admitted of

The want of sincerity, whichConstantine experienced in a tedious and fruitlessnegotiation, exasperated the fierceness of his temper;and he eagerly listened to those favourites, who sug­gested to him that his honour, as well as his interest,was concerned in the prosecution of the quarrel. Atthe head of a tumultuary band, suited for rapinerather than for conquest, he suddenly broke into thedominions of Constans, by the way of the JulianAlps, and the country round Aquileia felt the firsteffects of his resentment. The measures of Constans,who then resided in Dacia, were directed with moreprudence and ability. On the news of his brother'sinvasion, he detached a select and disciplined bodyof his Illyrian troops, proposing to follow them inperson, with the remainder of his forces. But theconduct of his lieutenants soon terminated the un­natural contest. By the artful appearances of flight,Constantine was betrayed into an ambuscade, whichhad been concealed in a wood, where the rash youth,with a few attendants, was surprised, surrounded, andslain. His body, after it had been found in the ob­scure stream of the Alsa, obtained the honours of anImperial sepulchre; but his provinces transferredtheir allegiance to the conqueror, who, refusing toadmit his elder brother Constantius to any share inthese new acquisitions, maintained the undisputedpossession of more than two-thirds of the Romanempire.

was forfeited by treason; long and meritorious ser­vice, in the armies of Rome, raised him to the dig­nity of a military count; the narrow policy of thecourt of Theodosius had adopted the mischievous ex­pedient of supporting a legal government by theinterest of a powerful family; and the brother ofFirmus was invested with the command of Africa.His ambition soon usurped the administration of jus­tice, and of the finances, without account, and with­out control; and he maintained, during a reign oftwelve years, the possession of an office from whichit was impossible to remove him, without the dangerof a civil war. During those twelve years, the pro­vince of Africa groaned under the dominion of atyrant, who seemed to unite the unfeeling temper ofa stranger with the partial resentments of domesticfaction. The forms of law were often superseded bythe use of poison; and if the trembling guests, whowere invited to the table of Gildo, presumed to ex­press their fears, the insolent suspicion served onlyto excite his fury, and he loudly summoned the mini­sters of death. In the civil war between Theodosiusand Eugenius, the count, or rather the sovereign,of Africa, maintained a haughty and suspicious neu­trality; refused to assist either of the contendingparties with troops or vessels, expected the declara­tion of fortune, and reserved for the conquerorthe vain professions of his allegiance. Such profes­sions would not have satisfied the master of the Ro­man world: but the death of Theodosius, and theweakness and discord of his sons, confirmed the powerof the Moor; who condescended, as a proof of hismoderation, to abstain from the use of the diadem,and to supply Rome with the customary tribute, orrather subsidy, of corn.

From the infusion of those herbs,which were supposed to possess a supernatural in­fluence, it was an easy step to the use of more sub­stantial poison; and the folly of mankind sometimesbecame the instrument, and the mask, of the mostatrocious crimes.
When Tacitus describes the deaths of the innocent ^tyofVa-and illustrious Romans, who were sacrificed to the era- ientinUnelty of the first Caesars, the art of the historian, or the a. d.364-^-merit of the sufferers, excite in our breasts the most 375,lively sensations of terror, of admiration, and of pity.The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianushas delineated his bloody figures with tedious and dis­gusting accuracy. But as our attention is no longerengaged by the contrast of freedom and servitude,of recent greatness and of actual misery, we shouldturn with horror from the frequent executions, whichdisgraced, both at Rome and Antioch, the reign ofthe two brothers. Valens was of a timid, and Va-lentinian of a choleric, disposition. An anxious re­gard to his personal safety was the ruling principleof the administration of Valens. In the condition ofa subject, he had kissed, with trembling awe, thehand of the oppressor: and when he ascended thethrone, he reasonably expected, that the same fears,which had subdued his own mind, would secure thepatient submission of his people. The favourites ofValens obtained, by the privilege of rapine and con­fiscation, the wealth which his economy would haverefused. They urged, with persuasive eloquence,that, in all cases of treason, suspicion is equivalentto proof; that the power, supposes the intention ofmischief; that the intention, is not less criminalthan the act; and that a subject no longer deservesto live, if his life may threaten the safety, or disturb

The judgment of Va-xx' lentinian was sometimes deceived, and his confidenceabused; but he would have silenced the informerswith a contemptuous smile, had they presumed toalarm his fortitude by the sound of danger. Theypraised his inflexible love of justice; and, in thepursuit of justice, the emperor was easily tempted toconsider clemency as a weakness, and passion as avirtue. As long as he wrestled with his equals, inthe bold competition of an active and ambitious life,Valentinian was seldom injured, and never insulted,with impunity; if his prudence was arraigned, hisspirit was applauded; and the proudest and mostpowerful generals were apprehensive of provokingthe resentment of a fearless soldier. After he be­came master of the world, he unfortunately forgot,that where no resistance can be made, no courage canbe exerted; and instead of consulting the dictates ofreason and magnanimity, he indulged the furiousemotions of his temper, at a time when they weredisgraceful to himself, and fatal to the defencelessobjects of his displeasure. In the government of hishousehold, or of his empire, slight, or even ima­ginary, offences; a hasty word, a casual omission, aninvoluntary delay, were chastised by a sentence ofimmediate death. The expressions which issued themost readily from the mouth of the emperor of theWest were, "Strike off his head;"—" burn him"alive;"—" let him be beaten with clubs till he"expires;" and his most favoured ministers soonunderstood, that, by a rash attempt to dispute, orsuspend, the execution of his sanguinary commands,they might involve themselves in the guilt and pu­nishment of disobedience. The repeated gratificationof this savage justice hardened the mind of Valen­tinian against pity and remorse; and the sallies ofpassion were confirmed by the habits of cruelty. He

If Constantine had the advantage of erecting thestandard of the cross, the emulation of his successorassumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy, andof abolishing the worship of idols in the Romanworld. Theodosius was the first of the emperorsbaptised in the true faith of the Trinity. Althoughhe was born of a Christian family, the maxims, or atleast the practice, of the age, encouraged him to delaythe ceremony of his initiation ; till he was admonishedof the danger of delay, by the serious illness whichthreatened his life, towards the end of the first yearof his reign. Before he again took the field againstthe Goths, he received the sacrament of baptism fromAcholius, the orthodox bishop of Thessalonica: and,as the emperor ascended from the holy font, stillglowing with the warm feelings of regeneration, hedictated a solemn edict, which proclaimed his ownfaith, and prescribed the religion of his subjects."It is our pleasure (such is the Imperial style) that"all the nations, which are governed by our clemency"and moderation, should stedfastly adhere to the"religion which was taught by St. Peter to the Ro-"mans; which faithful tradition has preserved; and"which is now professed by the pontiff Uamasus,"and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of apo-"stolic holiness.

Coche was situate on thewestern side of the Tigris ; but it was naturally con­sidered as a suburb of Ctesiphon, with which we maysuppose it to have been connected by a permanentbridge of boats. The united parts contributed toform the common epithet of Al Modain, the cities,which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter re­sidence of the Sassanides; and the whole circum­ference of the Persian capital was strongly fortifiedby the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by im­practicable morasses. Near the ruins of Seleucia, thecamp of Julian was fixed; and secured, by a ditchand rampart, against the sallies of the numerous andenterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful andpleasant country, the Romans were plentifully sup­plied with water and forage; and several forts, whichmight have embarrassed the motions of the army, sub­mitted, after some resistance, to the efforts of theirvalour. The fleet passed from the Euphrates into anartificial derivation of that river, which pours a copiousand navigable stream into the Tigris, at a small di­stance below the great city. If they had followed thisroyal canal, which bore the name of Nahar-Malcha,the intermediate situation of Coche would have sepa­rated the fleet and army of Julian; and the rash at­tempt of steering against the current of the Tigris,and forcing their way through the midst of a hostilecapital, must have been attended with the total de­struction of the Roman navy. The prudence of theemperor foresaw the danger, and provided the re­medy.

Themeasures of policy, and the operations of war, mustsubmit to the various accidents of circumstance andcharacter, and the unpractised student will often beperplexed in the application of the most perfecttheory.

But, as the senti­ments of gratitude and honour should invariably re­gulate the conduct of an individual, they may beoverbalanced in the mind of a sovereign, by the senseof superior duties: and the maxims both of justiceand humanity must permit the escape of an atrociouscriminal, if an innocent people would be involved inthe consequences of his punishment. The assassinof Gratian had usurped, but he actually possessed,the most warlike provinces of the empire: the Eastwas exhausted by the misfortunes, and even by thesuccess, of the Gothic war; and it was seriously tobe apprehended, that, after the vital strength of therepublic had been wasted in a doubtful and destruc­tive contest, the feeble conqueror would remain aneasy prey to the Barbarians of the North. Theseweighty considerations engaged Theodosius to dis­semble his resentment, and to accept the alliance ofthe tyrant. But he stipulated, that Maximus shouldcontent himself with the possession of the countries be­yond the Alps. The brother of Gratian was confirmedand secured in the sovereignty of Italy, Africa, and theWestern Illyricum; and some honourable conditionswere inserted in the treaty, to protect the memory,and the laws, of the deceased emperor. Accordingto the custom of the age, the images of the threeImperial colleagues were exhibited to the venerationof the people : nor should it be lightly supposed, that,in the moment of a solemn reconciliation, Theodosiussecretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge.The contempt of Gratian for the Roman soldiers

XIX'To the soil and climate of Assyria, nature had deniedsome of her choicest gifts, the vine, the olive, and thefig-tree; but the food which supports the life of man,and particularly wheat and barley, were produced withinexhaustible fertility; and the husbandman, whocommitted his seed to the earth, was frequently re­warded with an increase of two, or even of three,hundred. The face of the country was interspersedwith groves of innumerable palm-trees; and the dili­gent natives celebrated, either in verse or prose, thethree hundred and sixty uses to which the trunk, thebranches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit, wereskilfully applied. Several manufactures, especiallythose of leather and linen, employed the industry ofa numerous people, and afforded valuable materialsfor foreign trade; which appears, however, to havebeen conducted by the hands of strangers. Babylonhad been converted into a royal park; but near theruins of the ancient capital, new cities had successivelyarisen, and the populousness of the country was dis­played in the multitude of towns and villages, whichwere built of bricks, dried in the sun, and stronglycemented with bitumen, the natural and peculiar pro­duction of the Babylonian soil. While the successorsof Cyrus reigned over Asia, the province of Assyriaalone maintained, during a third part of the year,the luxurious plenty of the table and household ofthe Great King. Four considerable villages wereassigned for the subsistence of his Indian dogs; eighthundred stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, wereconstantly kept, at the expense of the country, forthe royal stables: and as the daily tribute, which waspaid to the satrap, amounted to one English bushelof silver, we may compute the annual revenue ofAssyria at more than twelve hundred thousand poundssterling.

The arrival of Honorius at Milan waswelcomed by a splendid exhibition of the games ofthe circus; and the emperor, though he was op­pressed by the weight of his disorder, contributed byhis presence to the public joy. But the remains ofhis strength were exhausted by the painful effortwhich he made to assist at the spectacles of themorning. Honorius supplied, during the rest of theday, the place of his father; and the great Theodo­sius expired in the ensuing night. Notwithstandingthe recent animosities' of a civil war, his death wasuniversally lamented.

The warlike inhabitants ofAnatho showed a disposition to stop the march of aRoman emperor; till they were diverted from suchfatal presumption, by the mild exhortations of princeHormisdas, and the approaching terrors of the fleetand army. They implored, and experienced, theclemency of Julian, who transplanted the people toan advantageous settlement near Chalcis in Syria,and admitted Pusaeus, the governor, to an honour­able rank in his service and friendship.

A soldier, of the life-guards of Gratian,was of the nation of the Alemanni, and of the tribeof the Lentienses, who dwelt beyond the lake ofConstance. Some domestic business obliged him torequest a leave of absence. In a short visit to hisfamily and friends, he was exposed to their curiousinquiries; and the vanity of the loquacious soldiertempted him to display his intimate acquaintancewith the secrets of the state, and the designs of hismaster. The intelligence, that Gratian was pre­paring to lead the military force of Gaul, and of theWest, to the assistance of his uncle Valens, pointedout to the restless spirit of the Alemanni the mo­ment, and the mode, of a successful invasion. Theenterprise of some light detachments, who, in themonth of February, passed the Rhine upon the ice,was the prelude of a more important war. Theboldest hopes of rapine, perhaps of conquest, out­weighed the considerations of timid prudence, or na­tional faith. Every forest, and every village, pouredforth a band of hardy adventurers; and the greatarmy of the Alemanni, which, on their approach,was estimated at forty thousand men by the fears ofthe people, was afterwards magnified to the numberof seventy thousand, by the vain and credulous flat­tery of the Imperial court.

A blowwas imprudently given; a sword was hastily drawn;and the first blood that was spilt in this accidentalquarrel became the signal of a long and destructivewar. In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance,Lupicinus was informed, by a secret messenger, thatmany of his soldiers were slain, and despoiled of theirarms; and as he was already inflamed by wine, andoppressed by sleep, he issued a rash command, thattheir death should be revenged by the massacre ofthe guards of Fritigern and Alavivus. The clamor­ous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern ofhis extreme danger: and, as he possessed the calmand intrepid spirit of a hero, he saw that he was lostif he allowed a moment of deliberation to the manwho had so deeply injured him.

The ponderous volumes of the Codes andPandects would furnish ample materials for a minuteinquiry into the system of provincial government, asin the space of six centuries it was improved by thewisdom of the Roman statesmen and lawyers. Itmay be sufficient for the historian to select two sin­gular and salutary provisions intended to restrainthe abuse of authority. 1. For the preservation ofpeace and order, the governors of the provinces werearmed with the sword of justice. They inflictedcorporal punishments, and they exercised, in capitaloffences, the power of life and death. But theywere not authorised to indulge the condemned cri­minal with the choice of his own execution, orto pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most ho­nourable kind of exile. These prerogatives werereserved to the pracfects, who alone could impose theheavy fine of fifty pounds of gold: their vicegerentswere confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces.This distinction, which seems to grant the larger,while it denies the smaller degree of authority, wasfounded on a very rational motive. The smallerdegree was infinitely more liable to abuse. Thepassions of a provincial magistrate might frequentlyprovoke him into acts of oppression, which affectedonly the freedom or the fortunes of the subject;though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps ofhumanity, he might still be terrified by the guilt ofinnocent blood. It may likewise be considered, thatexile, considerable fines, or the choice of an easydeath, relate more particularly to the rich and thenoble; and the persons the most exposed to the avariceor resentment of a provincial magistrate were thusremoved from his obscure persecution to the moreaugust and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian prae-

The formerwas raised, by the title of Caesar, to an equality withhis cousins. In favour of the latter, Constantineinvented the new and singular appellation of Nobi-lissimus; to which he annexed the flattering distinc­tion of a robe of purple and gold. But of the wholeseries of Roman princes in any age of the empire,Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the titleof King; a name which the subjects of Tiberiuswould have detested, as the profane and cruel insultof capricious tyranny. The use of such a title, evenas it appears under the reign of Constantine, is astrange and unconnected fact, which can scarcely beadmitted on the joint authority of Imperial medalsand contemporary writers.
The whole empire was deeply interested in the Their edu-

The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed,though not perhaps with equal success, to improvethe minds of the sons and nephews of Constantine.The most celebrated professors of the Christian faith,of the Grecian philosophy, and of the Roman juris­prudence, were invited by the liberality of the em­peror, who reserved for himself the important task of

The prompt and unexpected obe­dience of the general of the West convinced the vul­gar of his loyalty and moderation; and, as he hadalready engaged the affection of the Eastern troops,he recommended to their zeal the execution of hisbloody design, which might be accomplished in hisabsence with less danger, perhaps, and with less re­proach. Stilicho left the command of the troops ofthe East to Gainas, the Goth, on whose fidelity hefirmly relied; with an assurance, at least, that thehardy Barbarian would never be diverted from hispurpose by any consideration of fear or remorse.The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish theenemy of Stilicho, and of Rome; and such was thegeneral hatred which Rufinus had excited, that thefatal secret, communicated to thousands, was faith­fully preserved during the long march from Thessa­lonica to the gates of Constantinople.

Three or four hoursof the night had not passed away without some secretcabals; and when the election of an emperor wasproposed, the spirit of faction began to agitate theassembly. Victor and Arinthaeus collected the re­mains of the court of Constantius; the friends ofJulian attached themselves to the Gallic chiefs, Da-galaiphus and Nevitta; and the most fatal conse­quences might be apprehended from the discord oftwo factions, so opposite in their character and in­terest, in their maxims of government, and perhapsin their religious principles.

Gratian dissembled hisresentment till he could safely punish, or disgrace,the authors of the conspiracy; and though he uni­formly behaved with tenderness and regard to hisinfant colleague, he gradually confounded, in theadministration of the Western empire, the office ofa guardian with the authority of a sovereign.

The motives, whether of prideor of policy, which first induced Diocletian to with­draw himself from the ancient seat of government,had acquired additional weight by the example ofhis successors, and the habits of forty years. Romewas insensibly confounded with the dependent king­doms which had once acknowledged her supremacy;and the country of the Caesars was viewed with coldindifference by a martial prince, born in the neigh­bourhood of the Danube, educated in the courtsand armies of Asia, and invested with the purple bythe legions of Britain. The Italians, who had re­ceived Constantine as their deliverer, submissivelyobeyed the edicts which he sometimes condescendedto address to the senate and people of Rome; butthey were seldom honoured with the presence oftheir new sovereign. During the vigour of his age,Constantine, according to the various exigencies ofpeace and war, moved with slow dignity, or withactive diligence, along the frontiers of his extensivedominions; and was always prepared to take thefield either against a foreign or a domestic enemy.But as he gradually reached the summit of pros­perity and the decline of life, he began to meditatethe design of fixing in a more permanent station thestrength as well as majesty of the throne.

The cities which signalizeda forward zeal by the voluntary destruction of theirtemples were distinguished by municipal privileges,and rewarded with popular donatives; and the newcapital of the East gloried in the singular advantage,that Constantinople was never profaned by the wor­ship of idols.
The powerful influence of Constantine was notcircumscribed by the narrow limits of his life, or ofhis dominions. The education which he bestowedon his sons, and nephews, secured to the empire arace of princes whose faith was still more lively andsincere, as they imbibed in their earliest infancy thedoctrines of Christianity. War and commerce hadspread the knowledge of the Gospel beyond the con­fines of the Roman provinces, and the Barbarians,who had disdained an humble and proscribed sect,soon learned to esteem a religion which had been solately embraced by the greatest monarch and themost civilized nation of the globe. The Goths andGermans who enlisted under the standard of Romerevered the cross which glittered at the head of thelegions, and their fierce countrymen received at thesame time the lessons of faith and of humanity.

They stillprotested, that prayers and tears were their onlyweapons against the impious tyrant, whose head theydevoted to the justice of offended Heaven. But theyinsinuated, with sullen resolution, that their sub­mission was no longer the effect of weakness; andthat, in the imperfect state of human virtue, thepatience, which is founded on principle, may be ex­hausted by persecution. It is impossible to deter­mine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailedover his good sense and humanity: but, if we se­riously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church,we shall be convinced, that, before the emperorcould have extinguished the religion of Christ, hemust have involved his country in the horrors of acivil war.

This naval victory contributed to de­termine the event of the war; and the names ofConstantine and of Crispus were united in the joyfulacclamations of their eastern subjects: who loudlyproclaimed, that the world had been subdued, andwas now governed, by an emperor endowed withevery virtue; and by his illustrious son, a prince be­loved of heaven, and the lively image of his father'sperfections.

A sea contracted within suchnarrow limits may seem but ill to deserve the sin­gular epithet of broad, which Homer, as well asOrpheus, has frequently bestowed on the Hellespont.But our ideas of greatness are of a relative nature:the traveller, and especially the poet, who sailedalong the Hellespont, who pursued the windingsof the stream, and contemplated the rural scenery,which appeared on every side to terminate the pro­spect, insensibly lost the remembrance of the sea;and his fancy painted those celebrated streights, withall the'attributes of a mighty river flowing with aswift current, in the midst of a woody and inlandcountry, and at length, through a wide mouth, dis­charging itself into the ^Egean or Archipelago.Ancient Troy, seated on an eminence at the foot ofMount Ida, overlooked the mouth of the Hellespont,which scarcely received an accession of waters fromthe tribute of those immortal rivulets the Simoisand Scamander.

He was impatient to possess the palace ofConstantinople; and to prevent the ambition of somecompetitor, who might occupy the vacant allegianceof Europe. But he soon received the grateful intel­ligence, that his authority was acknowledged from theThracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic ocean. By thefirst letters which he despatched from the camp ofMesopotamia, he had delegated the military com­mand of Gaul and Illyricum to Malarich, a brave andfaithful officer of the nation of the Franks; and to hisfather-in-law, count Lucillian, who had formerly di­stinguished his courage and conduct in the defence ofNisibis. Malarich had declined an office to which hethought himself unequal; and Lucillian was massacredat Rheims, in an accidental mutiny of the Bataviancohorts. But the moderation of Jovinus, master ge­neral of the cavalry, who forgave the intention of hisdisgrace, soon appeased the tumult, and confirmedthe uncertain minds of the soldiers.

Theoppressed subjects celebrated their own felicity, thattheir sovereign should graciously consent to acceptthis feeble but voluntary testimony of their loyaltyand gratitude.
Conclusion. A people elated by pride, or soured by discontent,are seldom qualified to form a just estimate of theiractual situation. The subjects of Constantine wereincapable of discerning the decline of genius andmanly virtue, which so far degraded them below thedignity of their ancestors; but they could feel andlament the rage of tyranny, the relaxation of disci­pline, and the increase of taxes. The impartial hi­storian, who acknowledges the justice of their com­plaints, will observe some favourable circumstanceswhich tended to alleviate the misery of their con­dition. The threatening tempest of Barbarians,which so soon subverted the foundations of Romangreatness, was still repelled, or suspended, on thefrontiers. The arts of luxury and literature werecultivated, and the elegant pleasures of society wereenjoyed by the inhabitants of a considerable portionof the globe. The forms, the pomp, and the expenseof the civil administration contributed to restrain theirregular licence of the soldiers; and although thelaws were violated by power, or perverted by subtlety,the sage principles of the Roman jurisprudence pre­served a sense of order and equity, unknown to thedespotic governments of the east.

According to thedifferent nature of lands, their real produce, in thevarious articles of wine or oil, corn or barley, woodor iron, was transported by the labour or at the ex­pense of the provincials to the Imperial magazines,from whence they were occasionally distributed, forthe use of the court, of the army, and of the twocapitals, Rome and Constantinople. The commis­sioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged tomake considerable purchases, that they were strictlyprohibited from allowing any compensation, or fromreceiving in money the value of those supplies whichwere exacted in kind. In the primitive simplicity ofsmall communities, this method may be well adaptedto collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people;but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude andof the utmost strictness, which in a corrupt and ab­solute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contestbetween the power of oppression and the arts of fraud.The agriculture of the Roman provinces was insen­sibly ruined, and, in the progress of despotism, whichtends to disappoint its own purpose, the emperorswere obliged to derive some merit from the forgive­ness of debts, or the remission of tributes, whichtheir subjects were utterly incapable of paying.

The remainder of their troops wasdistributed into several hundred cohorts of infantry,and squadrons of cavalry. Their arms, and titles,and ensigns, were calculated to inspire terror, and todisplay the variety of nations who marched under theImperial standard. And not a vestige was left ofthat severe simplicity, which, in the ages of freedomand victory, had distinguished the line of battle of aRoman anny from the confused host of an Asiaticmonarch. A more particular enumeration, drawnfrom the Notitia, might exercise the diligence of anantiquary; but the historian will content himselfwith observing, that the number of permanent sta­tions or garrisons established on the frontiers of theempire amounted to five hundred and eighty-three;and that, under the successors of Constantine, thecomplete force of the military establishment was com­puted at six hundred and forty-five thousand sol­diers*.

La Bleterie adds,"Ces paroles, dans la bouche d'un souverain, ressem-"blent bien a l'aveu d'une entreprise manquee."He afterwards quotes the same Jewish writer as Bas-nage; and having established the truth of this re­markable event, by the concurrent testimony of pagan,Jewish, and Christian historians, and having observedthat it is not denied by any contemporary writer, LaBleterie sums up the whole with saying, " qu'il-n'y-a"point dans toute l'antiquite de fait que soit plus"certain." He concludes his account with the fol­lowing words, "On ne peut contester le fait, sans"etablir le Pyrronism historique le plus insens£." Ihave mentioned the principal authors, both ancientand modern, who have written on the subject of thisremarkable event, without presuming to offer any opi­nion of my own.

The testimony ofZosimus cannot indeed be justified from the chargeof passion and prejudice; but, from the nature ofthis tribute, it seems reasonable to conclude that itwas arbitrary in the distribution, and extremelyrigorous in the mode of collecting. The secretwealth of commerce, and the precarious profits of artor labour, are susceptible only of a discretionary va­luation, which is seldom disadvantageous to the in­terest of the treasury; and as the person of the tradersupplies the want of a visible and permanent security,the payment of the imposition, which, in the case ofa land-tax, may be obtained by the seizure of pro­perty, can rarely be extorted by any other means thanthose of corporal punishments.

The prosecution wasconducted with an appearance of equity and modera­tion, which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favour­able event; his confidence was fortified by the solemnassurances, and perfidious oaths, of the president, whopresumed to interpose the sacred name of Theodosiushimself; and the unhappy father was at last persuadedto recall, by a private letter, the fugitive Proculus. Hewas instantly seized, examined, condemned, and be­headed, in one of the suburbs of Constantinople, witha precipitation which disappointed the clemency of theemperor. Without respecting the misfortunes of aconsular senator, the cruel judges of Tatian compelledhim to behold the execution of his son: the fatal cordwas fastened round his own neck; but in the momentwhen he expected, and perhaps desired, the relief ofa speedy death, he was permitted to consume themiserable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile.The punishment of the two praefects might, perhaps,be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own

Instead of embracing the lastrefuge of generous despair, he tamely submitted tohis fate; and taking the diadem from his head, inthe view of both armies, fell prostrate at the feet'of his conqueror. Constantius used his victory withprudence and moderation; and raising from theground the aged suppliant, whom he affected to styleby the endearing name of Father, he gave him hishand to descend from the throne. The city of Prusawas assigned for the exile or retirement of the ab­dicated monarch, who lived six years in the enjoy­ment of ease and affluence. He often expressed hisgrateful sense of the goodness of Constantius, and,with a very amiable simplicity, advised his benefactorto resign the sceptre of the world, and to seek forcontent (where alone it could be found) in thepeaceful obscurity of a private condition.
The behaviour of Constantius on this memorable M^ *■*occasion was celebrated with some appearance of jus- Magnentius,tice; and his courtiers compared the studied orations A'D'351'which a Pericles or a Demosthenes addressed to thepopulace of Athens, with the victorious eloquencewhich had persuaded an armed multitude to desertand depose the object of their partial choice.

The mar­tial youth deserted, with indignant grief, the wallswhich they had so gloriously defended: the discon­solate mourner dropt a last tear over the tomb ofa son or husband, which must soon be profaned bythe rude hand of a Barbarian master; and the agedcitizen kissed the threshold, and clung to the doors,of the house, where he had passed the cheerful andcareless hours of infancy. The highways were crowdedwith a trembling multitude: the distinctions of rank,and sex, and age, were lost in the general calamity.Every one strove to bear away some fragment fromthe wreck of his fortunes; and as they could notcommand the immediate service of an adequate num­ber of horses or waggons, they were obliged to leavebehind them the greatest part of their valuable effects.The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to haveaggravated the hardships of these unhappy fugitives;They were seated, however, in a new-built quarterof Amida; and that rising city, with the reinforce­ment of a very considerable colony, soon recoveredits former splendour, and became the capital of Me­sopotamia *. Similar orders were despatched by theemperor for the evacuation of Singara and the castleof the Moors; and for the restitution of the fiveprovinces beyond the Tigris.

Let us not hesitate toindulge a liberal pride, that, in the present age, theenlightened part of Europe has abolished a cruel andodious prejudice, which reigned in every climate ofthe globe, and adhered to every system of religiousopinions. The nations, and the sects, of the Romanworld, admitted with equal credulity, and similar ab­horrence, the reality of that infernal art, which wasable to control the eternal order of the planets, andthe voluntary operations of the human mind. Theydreaded the mysterious power of spells and incanta­tions, of potent herbs, and execrable rites; whichcould extinguish or recal life, inflame the passionsof the soul, blast the works of creation, and extortfrom the reluctant daemons the secrets of futurity.They believed, with the wildest inconsistency, thatthis preternatural dominion of the air, of earth, andof hell, was exercised, from the vilest motives ofmalice or gain, by some wrinkled hags, and itinerantsorcerers, who passed their obscure lives in penuryand contempt. The arts of magic were equally con­demned by the public opinion, and by the laws ofRome; but as they tended to gratify the most im­perious passions of the heart of man, they were con­tinually proscribed, and continually practised. Animaginary cause is capable of producing the mostserious and mischievous effects. The dark predictionsof the death of an emperor, or the success of a con­spiracy, were calculated only to stimulate the hopesof ambition, and to dissolve the ties of fidelity; andthe intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by theactual crimes of treason and sacrilege. Such vainterrors disturbed the peace of society, and the hap­piness of individuals; and the harmless flame whichinsensibly melted a waxen image, might derive a

From the moment that the Romans entered the His marchenemy's country, the country of an active and artful desertofenemy, the order of march was disposed in threecolumns. The strength of the infantry, and con­sequently of the whole army, was placed in thecentre, under the peculiar command of their master-general Victor. On the right, the brave Nevittaled a column of several legions along the banks ofthe Euphrates, and almost always in sight of thefleet. The left flank of the army was protected bythe column of cavalry. Hormisdas and Arinthauiswere appointed generals of the horse; and the sin­gular adventures of Hormisdas are not undeservingof our notice. He was a Persian prince, of the royalrace of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of theminority of Sapor, had escaped from prison to thehospitable court of the great Constantine. Hor­misdas at first excited the compassion, and at lengthacquired the esteem, of his new masters; his valourand fidelity raised him to the military honours of theRoman service; and, though' a Christian, he mightindulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his un­grateful country, that an oppressed subject may provethe most dangerous enemy.

His generals passed theBosphorus, and subdued, without an effort, the un­armed, but wealthy, provinces of Bithynia and Asia.After an honourable defence, the city and island ofCyzicus yielded to his power: the rerfowned legionsof the Jovians and Herculians embraced the causeof the usurper, whom they were ordered to crush;and, as the veterans were continually augmentedwith new levies, he soon appeared at the head of anarmy, whose valour, as well as numbers, were notunequal to the greatness of the contest.

As longas the emperors condescended to disguise the ser­vitude which they imposed, the consuls were stillelected by the real or apparent suffrage of the senate.From the reign of Diocletian, even these vestigesof liberty were abolished, and the successful candi­dates who were invested with the annual honours ofthe consulship, affected to deplore the humiliatingcondition of their predecessors.

A tale so moral and so interesting woulddeserve to be supported by less exceptionable autho­rity; but if we consult the more ancient and au­thentic writers, they will inform us, that the repent­ance of Constantine was manifested only in acts ofblood and revenge; and that he atoned for the mur­der of an innocent son, by the execution, perhaps,of a guilty wife. They ascribe the misfortunes ofCrispus to the arts of his stepmother Fausta, whoseimplacable hatred, or whose disappointed love, re­newed in the palace of Constantine the ancienttragedy of Hippolitus and of Phaedra. Like thedaughter of Minos, the daughter of Maximian ac­cused her son-in-law of an incestuous attempt on thechastity of his father's wife; and easily obtained,from the jealousy of the emperor, a sentence of deathagainst a young prince, whom she considered withreason as the most formidable rival of her ownchildren. But Helena, the aged mother of Constan­tine, lamented and revenged the untimely fate ofher grandson Crispus: nor was it long before a realor pretended discovery was made, that Fausta her­self entertained a criminal connexion with a slavebelonging to the Imperial stables.

The magistrates of themost distant provinces were therefore directed to in­stitute schools, to appoint professors, and by the hopesof rewards and privileges, to engage in the study andpractice of architecture a sufficient number of in­genious youths, who had received a liberal education.The buildings of the new city were executed by suchartificers as the reign of Constantine could afford;

All the civil magistrates were drawn from the The profes,profession of the law. The celebrated Institutes of law.Justinian are addressed to the youth of his dominions,who had devoted themselves to the study of Romanjurisprudence; and the sovereign condescends toanimate their diligence, by the assurance that theirskill and ability would in time be rewarded by anadequate share in the government of the republic.The rudiments of this lucrative science were taughtin all the considerable cities of the east and west;but the most famous school was that of Berytus, onthe coast of Phoenicia; which flourished above threecenturies from the time of Alexander Severus, theauthor perhaps of an institution so advantageous tohis native country.

They claimed as their own thecountry which they had saved; and excused theirwant of spirit, by pleading the sacred and more im­mediate duty of protecting their families and friends.The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived fromthe knowledge of the impending and inevitable dan­ger. As soon as the provinces were exhausted oftheir military strength, the Germans would violatea treaty which had been imposed on their fears; andnotwithstanding the abilities and valour of Julian,the general of a nominal army, to whom the publiccalamities would be imputed, must find himself, aftera vain resistance, either a prisoner in the camp ofthe Barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of Con-stantius. If Julian complied with the orders whichhe had received, he subscribed his own destruction,and that of a people who deserved his affection. Buta positive refusal was an act of rebellion, and a de­claration of war. The inexorable jealousy of theemperor, the peremptory, and perhaps insidious,nature of his commands, left not any room for a fairapology, or candid interpretation; and the depend­ent station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him topause or to deliberate. Solitude increased the per­plexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to thefaithful counsels of Sallust, who had been removedfrom his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs:he could not even enforce his representations by theconcurrence of the ministers, who would have beenafraid, or ashamed, to approve the ruin of Gaul.The moment had been chosen, when Lupicinus *,

He was subdued by the perseverance ofTheodosius; who had formed an indexible deter­mination, that the war should end only by the deathof the tyrant: and that every nation of Africa, whichpresumed to support his cause, should be involved inhis ruin. At the head of a small body of troops,which seldom exceeded three thousand five hundredmen, the Roman general advanced with a steady pru­dence, devoid of rashness or of fear, into the heart ofa country, where he was sometimes attacked by armiesof twenty thousand Moors. The boldness of hischarge dismayed the irregular Barbarians; they weredisconcerted by his seasonable and orderly retreats;they were continually baffled by the unknown re­sources of the military art; and they felt and con­fessed the just superiority which was assumed by theleader of a civilised nation.

Constantius had declared his intention ofdeciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis, a namethat would animate his troops by the remembranceof the victory which, on the same auspicious ground,had been obtained by the arms of his father Con-stantine. Yet by the impregnable fortifications withwhich the emperor encompassed his camp, he ap­peared to decline, rather than to invite, a generalengagement. It was the object of Magnentius totempt or to compel his adversary to relinquish thisadvantageous position; and he employed, with thatview, the various marches, evolutions, and stratagems,which the knowledge of the art of war could suggestto an experienced officer. He carried by assault theimportant town of Siscia; made an attack on thecity of Sirmium, which lay in the rear of the Imperialcamp; attempted to force a passage over the Saveinto the eastern provinces of Illyricum; and cut inpieces a numerous detachment, which he had alluredinto the narrow passes of Adarne. During thegreater part of the summer, the tyrant of Gaulshowed himself master of the field.

Beyond the utmost limits of the Moors,the vast and inhospitable desert of the South extendsabove a thousand miles to the banks of the Niger.The ancients, who had a very faint and imperfectknowledge of the great peninsula of Africa, weresometimes tempted to believe, that the torrid zonemust ever remain destitute of inhabitants: and theysometimes amused their fancy by filling the vacantspace with headless men, or rather monsters; withhorned and cloven-footed satyrs; with fabulous cen­taurs; and with human pigmies, who waged a boldand doubtful warfare against the cranes. Carthagewould have trembled at the strange intelligence, thatthe countries on either side of the equator were filledwith innumerable nations, who differed only in then,colour from the ordinary appearance of the humanspecies ; and the subjects of the Roman empire mighthave anxiously expected, that the swarms of Barba­rians, which issued from the North, would soon beencountered from the South by new swarms of Bar­barians, equally fierce, and equally formidable.

Theywere connected with the Romans, by the mutualbenefits of commerce; as they were supplied fromthe provinces of Asia with corn and manufactures,which they purchased with their only productions,salt, wax, and hides. Obedient to the requisition ofConstantine, they prepared, under the conduct oftheir magistrate Diogenes, a considerable army, ofwhich the principal strength consisted in cross-bowsand military chariots. The speedy march and in­trepid attack of the Chersonites, by diverting theattention of the Goths, assisted the operations of theImperial generals. The Goths, vanquished on everyside, were driven into the mountains, where, in thecourse of a severe campaign, above a hundred thou­sand were computed to have perished by cold andhunger. Peace was at length granted to their hum­ble supplications; the eldest son of Araric was ac­cepted as the most valuable hostage; and Constan­tine endeavoured to convince their chiefs, by a liberaldistribution of honours and rewards, how far thefriendship Of the Romans was preferable to their en­mity. In the expressions of his gratitude towards thefaithful Chersonites, the emperor was still more mag­nificent. The pride of the nation was gratified bythe splendid and almost royal decorations bestowedon their magistrate and his successors. A perpetualexemption from all duties was stipulated for theirvessels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea.A regular subsidy was promised, of iron, corn, oil,and of every supply which could be useful either inpeace or war.

The Circus, or Hippodrome, wasa stately building about four hundred paces in length,and one hundred in breadth. The space betweenthe two metce or goals was filled with statues andobelisks; and we may still remark a very singularfragment of antiquity; the bodies of three serpents,twisted into one pillar of'brass. Their triple headshad once supported the golden tripod which, afterthe defeat of Xerxes, was consecrated in the templeof Delphi by the victorious Greeks. The beauty ofthe Hippodrome has been long since defaced by therude hands of the Turkish conquerors; but, underthe similar appellation of Atmeidan, it still serves asa place of exercise for their horses.

The extensive plainwhich lies below ancient Troy, towards the Rhasteanpromontory and the tomb of Ajax, was first chosenfor his new capital; and though the undertaking wassoon relinquished, the stately remains of unfinishedwalls and towers attracted the notice of all who sailedthrough the streights of the Hellespont.rfC^fST ^e are at Present qualified to view the advantage-tinopie. ous position of Constantinople; which appears tohave been formed by Nature for the centre andcapital of a great monarchy. Situated in the forty-first degree of latitude, the Imperial city commanded,from her seven hills, the opposite shores of Europeand Asia; the climate was healthy and temperate,the soil fertile, the harbour secure and capacious;and the approach on the side of the continent was ofsmall extent and easy defence. The Bosphorus andthe Hellespont may be considered as the two gates ofConstantinople; and the prince who possessed thoseimportant passages could always shut them against anaval enemy, and open them to the fleets of com­merce. The preservation of the eastern provincesmay, in some degree, be ascribed to the policy ofConstantine, as the barbarians of the Euxine, who inthe preceding age had poured their armaments intothe heart of the Mediterranean, soon desisted fromthe exercise of piracy, and despaired of forcing thisinsurmountable barrier.

These evils, however terrible they may appear,were confined to the smaller number of Roman sub­jects, whose dangerous situation was in some degreecompensated by the enjoyment of those advantages,either of nature or of fortune, which exposed themto the jealousy of the monarch. The obscure mil­lions of a great empire have much less to dread fromthe cruelty than from the avarice of their masters;and their humble happiness is principally affectedby the grievance of excessive taxes, "which, gentlypressing on the wealthy, descend with acceleratedweight on the meaner and more indigent classes ofsociety. An ingenious philosopher * has calculatedthe universal measure of the public impositions bythe degrees of freedom and servitude; and venturesto assert, that, according to an invariable law ofnature, it must always increase with the former, anddiminish in a just proportion to the latter. But thisreflection, which would tend to alleviate the miseriesof despotism, is contradicted at least by the historyof the Roman empire; which accuses the sameprinces of despoiling the senate of its authority, andthe provinces of their wealth. Without abolishingall the various customs and duties on merchandizes,which are imperceptibly discharged by the apparentchoice of the purchaser, the policy of Constantineand his successors preferred a simple and directmode of taxation, more congenial to the spirit of anarbitrary government.

The arts of fraud were madesubservient to the designs of cruelty; and a manifestforgery was attested by a person of the most sacredcharacter. From the hands of the bishop of Nico-media, Constantius received a fatal scroll, affirmed tobe the genuine testament of his father; in which theemperor expressed his suspicions that he had beenpoisoned by his brothers; and conjured his sons torevenge his death, and to consult their own safety,by the punishment of the guilty. Whatever reasonsmight have been alleged by these unfortunate princesto defend their life and honour against so incrediblean accusation, they were silenced by the furious cla­mours of the soldiers, who declared themselves, atonce, their enemies, their judges, and their exe­cutioners. The spirit, and even the forms of legalproceedings were repeatedly violated in a promiscuousmassacre; which involved the two uncles of Con­stantius, seven of his cousins, of whom Dalmatiusand Hannibalianus were the most illustrious, the Pa­trician Optatus, who had married a sister of the lateemperor, and the Praefect Ablavius, whose power andriches had inspired him with some hopes of obtainingthe purple.

The insolent and brutallover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric;and he sternly rejected the importunate clamours ofthe multitude, who, on the day of the public games,lamented the absence of their favourite, and consi­dered the skill of a charioteer as an object of moreimportance than his virtue. The resentment of thepeople was imbittered by some previous disputes;and, as the strength of the garrison had been drawnaway for the service of the Italian war, the feebleremnant, whose numbers were reduced by desertion,could not save the unhappy general from their licen­tious fury. Botheric, and several of his principalofficers, were inhumanly murdered: their mangledbodies were dragged about the streets; and the em­peror, who then resided at Milan, was surprised bythe intelligence of the audacious and wanton crueltyof the people of Thessalonica.

In the neighbourhood XIx'of the same river, at no very considerable distancefrom the fatal station of Dura, the ten thousandGreeks, without generals, or guides, or provisions,were abandoned, above twelve hundred miles fromtheir native country, to the resentment of a victori­ous monarch. The difference of their conduct andsuccess depended much more on their character thanon their situation. Instead of tamely resigningthemselves to the secret deliberations and privateviews of a single person, the united councils of theGreeks were inspired by the generous enthusiasm ofa popular assembly; where the mind of each citizenis filled with the love of glory, the pride of freedom,and the contempt of death. Conscious of their su­periority over the Barbarians in arms and discipline,they disdained to yield, they refused to capitulate;every obstacle was surmounted by their patience,courage, and military skill; and the memorable re­treat of the ten thousand exposed and insulted theweakness of the Persian monarchy*.

Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst over chap.the provinces of Gaul; and the mind of Gratian was XXLoppressed and distracted by the administration of theWestern empire. In this important crisis, the go­vernment of the East, and the conduct of the Gothicwar, required the undivided attention of a hero anda statesman. A subject invested with such amplecommand would not long have preserved his fidelityto a distant benefactor; and the Imperial councilembraced the wise and manly resolution, of confer­ring an obligation, rather than of yielding to an in­sult. It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the pur­ple as the reward of virtue; but, at the age of nine­teen, it is not easy for a prince, educated in thesupreme rank, to understand the true characters ofhis ministers and generals. He attempted to weigh,with an impartial hand, their various merits and de­fects; and, whilst he checked the rash confidence ofambition, he distrusted the cautious wisdom, whichdespaired of the republic. As each moment of delaydiminished something of the power and resources ofthe future sovereign of the East, the situation of thetimes would not allow a tedious debate. The choiceof Gratian was soon declared in favour of an exile,whose father, only three years before, had suffered,under the sanction of his authority, an unjust andignominious death.

The implacable zeal,with which Romanus prosecuted the legal revenge ofthis murder, could be ascribed only to a motive ofavarice, or personal hatred: but, on this occasion,his claims were just, his influence was weighty; andFirmus clearly understood, that he must either pre^sent his neck to the executioner, or appeal from thesentence of the Imperial consistory, to his sword, andto the people.
